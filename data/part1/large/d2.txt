The Shanty @-@ Keeper &apos;s Wife



There were about a dozen of us jammed into the coach , on the box seat
and hanging on to the roof and tailboard as best we could . We were
shearers , bagmen , agents , a squatter , a cockatoo , the usual joker -- and
one or two professional spielers , perhaps . We were tired and stiff and
nearly frozen -- too cold to talk and too irritable to risk the inevitable
argument which an interchange of ideas would have led up to . We had been
looking forward for hours , it seemed , to the pub where we were to change
horses . For the last hour or two all that our united efforts had been
able to get out of the driver was a grunt to the effect that it was
&quot; &apos; bout a couple o &apos; miles . &quot; Then he said , or grunted , &quot; &apos; Tain &apos;t fur now , &quot;
a couple of times , and refused to commit himself any further ; he seemed
grumpy about having committed himself that far .

He was one of those men who take everything in dead earnest ; who regard
any expression of ideas outside their own sphere of life as trivial , or ,
indeed , if addressed directly to them , as offensive ; who , in fact , are
darkly suspicious of anything in the shape of a joke or laugh on the
part of an outsider in their own particular dust @-@ hole . He seemed to
be always thinking , and thinking a lot ; when his hands were not both
engaged , he would tilt his hat forward and scratch the base of his
skull with his little finger , and let his jaw hang . But his intellectual
powers were mostly concentrated on a doubtful swingle @-@ tree , a misfitting
collar , or that there bay or piebald ( on the off or near side ) with the
sore shoulder .

Casual letters or papers , to be delivered on the road , were matters
which troubled him vaguely , but constantly -- like the abstract ideas of
his passengers .

The joker of our party was a humourist of the dry order , and had been
slyly taking rises out of the driver for the last two or three stages .
But the driver only brooded . He wasn &apos;t the one to tell you straight if
you offended him , or if he fancied you offended him , and thus gain your
respect , or prevent a misunderstanding which would result in life @-@ long
enmity . He might meet you in after years when you had forgotten all
about your trespass -- if indeed you had ever been conscious of it -- and
&quot; stoush &quot; you unexpectedly on the ear .

Also you might regard him as your friend , on occasion , and yet he would
stand by and hear a perfect stranger tell you the most outrageous lies ,
to your hurt , and know that the stranger was telling lies , and never put
you up to it . It would never enter his head to do so . It wouldn &apos;t be any
affair of his -- only an abstract question .

It grew darker and colder . The rain came as if the frozen south were
spitting at your face and neck and hands , and our feet grew as big as
camel &apos;s , and went dead , and we might as well have stamped the footboards
with wooden legs for all the feeling we got into ours . But they were
more comfortable that way , for the toes didn &apos;t curl up and pain so much ,
nor did our corns stick out so hard against the leather , and shoot .

We looked out eagerly for some clearing , or fence , or light -- some sign
of the shanty where we were to change horses -- but there was nothing
save blackness all round . The long , straight , cleared road was no longer
relieved by the ghostly patch of light , far ahead , where the bordering
tree @-@ walls came together in perspective and framed the ether . We were
down in the bed of the bush .

We pictured a haven of rest with a suspended lamp burning in the frosty
air outside and a big log fire in a cosy parlour off the bar , and a
long table set for supper . But this is a land of contradictions ; wayside
shanties turn up unexpectedly and in the most unreasonable places , and
are , as likely as not , prepared for a banquet when you are not hungry
and can &apos;t wait , and as cold and dark as a bushman &apos;s grave when you are
and can .

Suddenly the driver said : &quot; We &apos;re there now . &quot; He said this as if he had
driven us to the scaffold to be hanged , and was fiercely glad that he &apos;d
got us there safely at last . We looked but saw nothing ; then a light
appeared ahead and seemed to come towards us ; and presently we saw that
it was a lantern held up by a man in a slouch hat , with a dark bushy
beard , and a three @-@ bushel bag around his shoulders . He held up his other
hand , and said something to the driver in a tone that might have been
used by the leader of a search party who had just found the body . The
driver stopped and then went on slowly .

&quot; What &apos;s up ? &quot; we asked . &quot; What &apos;s the trouble ? &quot;

&quot; Oh , it &apos;s all right , &quot; said the driver .

&quot; The publican &apos;s wife is sick , &quot; somebody said , &quot; and he wants us to come
quietly . &quot;

The usual little slab and bark shanty was suggested in the gloom , with a
big bark stable looming in the background . We climbed down like so many
cripples . As soon as we began to feel our legs and be sure we had the
right ones and the proper allowance of feet , we helped , as quietly as
possible , to take the horses out and round to the stable .

&quot; Is she very bad ? &quot; we asked the publican , showing as much concern as we
could .

&quot; Yes , &quot; he said , in a subdued voice of a rough man who had spent several
anxious , sleepless nights by the sick bed of a dear one . &quot; But , God
willing , I think we &apos;ll pull her through . &quot;

Thus encouraged we said , sympathetically : &quot; We &apos;re very sorry to trouble
you , but I suppose we could manage to get a drink and a bit to eat ? &quot;

&quot; Well , &quot; he said , &quot; there &apos;s nothing to eat in the house , and I &apos;ve only got
rum and milk . You can have that if you like . &quot;

One of the pilgrims broke out here .

&quot; Well of all the pubs , &quot; he began , &quot; that I &apos;ve ever -- &quot;

&quot; Hush @-@ sh @-@ sh ! &quot; said the publican .

The pilgrim scowled and retired to the rear . You can &apos;t express your
feelings freely when there &apos;s a woman dying close handy .

&quot; Well , who says rum and milk ? &quot; asked the joker , in a low voice .

&quot; Wait here , &quot; said the publican , and disappeared into the little front
passage .

Presently a light showed through a window , with a scratched and
fly @-@ bitten B and A on two panes , and a mutilated R on the third , which
was broken . A door opened , and we sneaked into the bar . It was like
having drinks after hours where the police are strict and independent .

When we came out the driver was scratching his head and looking at the
harness on the verandah floor .

&quot; You fellows &apos; ll have ter put in the time for an hour or so . The horses
is out back somewheres , &quot; and he indicated the interior of Australia with
a side jerk of his head , &quot; and the boy ain &apos;t back with &apos; em yet . &quot;

&quot; But dash it all , &quot; said the Pilgrim , &quot; me and my mate -- -- &quot;

&quot; Hush ! &quot; said the publican .

&quot; How long are the horses likely to be ? &quot; we asked the driver .

&quot; Dunno , &quot; he grunted . &quot; Might be three or four hours . It &apos;s all accordin &apos; . &quot;

&quot; Now , look here , &quot; said the Pilgrim , &quot; me and my mate wanter catch the
train . &quot;

&quot; Hush @-@ sh @-@ sh ! &quot; from the publican in a fierce whisper .

&quot; Well , boss , &quot; said the joker , &quot; can you let us have beds , then ? I don &apos;t
want to freeze here all night , anyway . &quot;

&quot; Yes , &quot; said the landlord , &quot; I can do that , but some of you will have to
sleep double and some of you &apos;ll have to take it out of the sofas , and
one or two &apos; ll have to make a shakedown on the floor . There &apos;s plenty of
bags in the stable , and you &apos;ve got rugs and coats with you . Fix it up
amongst yourselves . &quot;

&quot; But look here ! &quot; interrupted the Pilgrim , desperately , &quot; we can &apos;t afford
to wait ! We &apos;re only &apos; battlers &apos; , me and my mate , pickin &apos; up crumbs by the
wayside . We &apos;ve got to catch the -- -- &quot;

&quot; Hush ! &quot; said the publican , savagely . &quot; You fool , didn &apos;t I tell you my
missus was bad ? I won &apos;t have any noise . &quot;

&quot; But look here , &quot; protested the Pilgrim , &quot; we must catch the train at Dead
Camel -- -- &quot;

&quot; You &apos;ll catch my boot presently , &quot; said the publican , with a savage oath ,
&quot; and go further than Dead Camel . I won &apos;t have my missus disturbed
for you or any other man ! Just you shut up or get out , and take your
blooming mate with you . &quot;

We lost patience with the Pilgrim and sternly took him aside .

&quot; Now , for God &apos;s sake , hold your jaw , &quot; we said . &quot; Haven &apos;t you got any
consideration at all ? Can &apos;t you see the man &apos;s wife is ill -- dying
perhaps -- and he nearly worried off his head ? &quot;

The Pilgrim and his mate were scraggy little bipeds of the city push
variety , so they were suppressed .

&quot; Well , &quot; yawned the joker , &quot; I &apos;m not going to roost on a stump all night .
I &apos;m going to turn in . &quot;

&quot; It &apos;ll be eighteenpence each , &quot; hinted the landlord . &quot; You can settle now
if you like to save time . &quot;

We took the hint , and had another drink . I don &apos;t know how we &quot; fixed it
up amongst ourselves , &quot; but we got settled down somehow . There was a lot
of mysterious whispering and scuffling round by the light of a couple of
dirty greasy bits of candle . Fortunately we dared not speak loud enough
to have a row , though most of us were by this time in the humour to pick
a quarrel with a long @-@ lost brother .

The Joker got the best bed , as good @-@ humoured , good @-@ natured chaps
generally do , without seeming to try for it . The growler of the party
got the floor and chaff bags , as selfish men mostly do -- without seeming
to try for it either . I took it out of one of the &quot; sofas &quot; , or rather
that sofa took it out of me . It was short and narrow and down by the
head , with a leaning to one corner on the outside , and had more nails
and bits of gin @-@ case than original sofa in it .

I had been asleep for three seconds , it seemed , when somebody shook me
by the shoulder and said :

&quot; Take yer seats . &quot;

When I got out , the driver was on the box , and the others were getting
rum and milk inside themselves ( and in bottles ) before taking their
seats .

It was colder and darker than before , and the South Pole seemed nearer ,
and pretty soon , but for the rum , we should have been in a worse fix
than before .

There was a spell of grumbling . Presently someone said :

&quot; I don &apos;t believe them horses was lost at all . I was round behind the
stable before I went to bed , and seen horses there ; and if they wasn &apos;t
them same horses there , I &apos;ll eat &apos; em raw ! &quot;

&quot; Would yer ? &quot; said the driver , in a disinterested tone .

&quot; I would , &quot; said the passenger . Then , with a sudden ferocity , &quot; and you
too ! &quot;

The driver said nothing . It was an abstract question which didn &apos;t
interest him .

We saw that we were on delicate ground , and changed the subject for a
while . Then someone else said :

&quot; I wonder where his missus was ? I didn &apos;t see any signs of her about , or
any other woman about the place , and we was pretty well all over it . &quot;

&quot; Must have kept her in the stable , &quot; suggested the Joker .

&quot; No , she wasn &apos;t , for Scotty and that chap on the roof was there after
bags . &quot;

&quot; She might have been in the loft , &quot; reflected the Joker .

&quot; There was no loft , &quot; put in a voice from the top of the coach .

&quot; I say , Mister -- Mister man , &quot; said the Joker suddenly to the driver , &quot; Was
his missus sick at all ? &quot;

&quot; I dunno , &quot; replied the driver . &quot; She might have been . He said so , anyway .
I ain &apos;t got no call to call a man a liar . &quot;

&quot; See here , &quot; said the cannibalistic individual to the driver , in the tone
of a man who has made up his mind for a row , &quot; has that shanty @-@ keeper got
a wife at all ? &quot;

&quot; I believe he has . &quot;

&quot; And is she living with him ? &quot;

&quot; No , she ain &apos;t -- if yer wanter know . &quot;

&quot; Then where is she ? &quot;

&quot; I dunno . How am I to know ? She left him three or four years ago . She
was in Sydney last time I heard of her . It ain &apos;t no affair of mine ,
anyways . &quot;

&quot; And is there any woman about the place at all , driver ? &quot; inquired a
professional wanderer reflectively .

&quot; No -- not that I knows on . There useter be a old black gin come pottering
round sometimes , but I ain &apos;t seen her lately . &quot;

&quot; And excuse me , driver , but is there anyone round there at all ? &quot;
enquired the professional wanderer , with the air of a conscientious
writer , collecting material for an Australian novel from life , with an
eye to detail .

&quot; Naw , &quot; said the driver -- and recollecting that he was expected to be
civil and obliging to his employers &apos; patrons , he added in surly apology ,
&quot; Only the boss and the stableman , that I knows of . &quot; Then repenting
of the apology , he asserted his manhood again , and asked , in a
tone calculated to risk a breach of the peace , &quot; Any more questions ,
gentlemen -- while the shop &apos;s open ? &quot;

There was a long pause .

&quot; Driver , &quot; asked the Pilgrim appealingly , &quot; was them horses lost at all ? &quot;

&quot; I dunno , &quot; said the driver . &quot; He said they was . He &apos;s got the looking
after them . It was nothing to do with me . &quot;

. . . . .

&quot; Twelve drinks at sixpence a drink &quot; -- said the Joker , as if calculating
to himself -- &quot; that &apos;s six bob , and , say on an average , four shouts -- that &apos;s
one pound four . Twelve beds at eighteenpence a bed -- that &apos;s eighteen
shillings ; and say ten bob in various drinks and the stuff we brought
with us , that &apos;s two pound twelve . That publican didn &apos;t do so bad out of
us in two hours . &quot;

We wondered how much the driver got out of it , but thought it best not
to ask him .

. . . . .

We didn &apos;t say much for the rest of the journey . There was the usual man
who thought as much and knew all about it from the first , but he
wasn &apos;t appreciated . We suppressed him . One or two wanted to go back and
&quot; stoush &quot; that landlord , and the driver stopped the coach cheerfully at
their request ; but they said they &apos;d come across him again and allowed
themselves to be persuaded out of it . It made us feel bad to think how
we had allowed ourselves to be delayed , and robbed , and had sneaked
round on tiptoe , and how we had sat on the inoffensive Pilgrim and his
mate , and all on account of a sick wife who didn &apos;t exist .

The coach arrived at Dead Camel in an atmosphere of mutual suspicion and
distrust , and we spread ourselves over the train and departed .




A Gentleman Sharper and Steelman Sharper



Steelman and Smith had been staying at the hotel for several days in the
dress and character of bushies down for what they considered a spree .
The gentleman sharper from the Other Side had been hanging round
them for three days now . Steelman was the more sociable , and , to all
appearances , the greener of the two bush mates ; but seemed rather
too much under the influence of Smith , who was reserved , suspicious ,
self @-@ contained , or sulky . He almost scowled at Gentleman Sharper &apos;s
&quot; Good @-@ morning ! &quot; and &quot; Fine day ! &quot; , replied in monosyllables and turned
half away with an uneasy , sullen , resentful hump of his shoulder and
shuffle of his feet .

Steelman took Smith for a stroll on the round , bald tussock hills
surrounding the city , and rehearsed him for the last act until after
sundown .

Gentleman Sharper was lounging , with a cigar , on the end of the balcony ,
where he had been contentedly contemplating the beautiful death of day .
His calm , classic features began to whiten ( and sharpen ) in the frosty
moonlight .

Steelman and Smith sat on deck @-@ chairs behind a half @-@ screen of ferns
on the other end of the balcony , smoked their after @-@ dinner smoke , and
talked in subdued tones as befitted the time and the scene -- great ,
softened , misty hills in a semicircle , and the water and harbour lights
in moonlight .

The other boarders were loitering over dinner , in their rooms , or gone
out ; the three were alone on the balcony , which was a rear one .

Gentleman Sharper moved his position , carelessly , noiselessly , yet
quickly , until he leaned on the rail close to the ferns and could
overhear every word the bushies said . He had dropped his cigar
overboard , and his scented handkerchief behind a fern @-@ pot en route .

&quot; But he looks all right , and acts all right , and talks all right -- and
shouts all right , &quot; protested Steelman . &quot; He &apos;s not stumped , for I saw
twenty or thirty sovereigns when he shouted ; and he doesn &apos;t seem to care
a damn whether we stand in with him or not . &quot;

&quot; There you are ! That &apos;s just where it is ! &quot; said Smith , with some
logic , but in a tone a wife uses in argument ( which tone , by the way ,
especially if backed by logic or common sense , makes a man wild sooner
than anything else in this world of troubles ) .

Steelman jerked his chair half @-@ round in disgust . &quot; That &apos;s you ! &quot; he
snorted , &quot; always suspicious ! Always suspicious of everybody and
everything ! If I found myself shot into a world where I couldn &apos;t trust
anybody I &apos;d shoot myself out of it . Life would be worse than not worth
living . Smith , you &apos;ll never make money , except by hard graft -- hard ,
bullocking , nigger @-@ driving graft like we had on that damned railway
section for the last six months , up to our knees in water all winter ,
and all for a paltry cheque of one @-@ fifty -- twenty of that gone already .
How do you expect to make money in this country if you won &apos;t take
anything for granted , except hard cash ? I tell you , Smith , there &apos;s
a thousand pounds lost for every one gained or saved by trusting too
little . How did Vanderbilt and -- -- &quot;

Steelman elaborated to a climax , slipping a glance warily , once or
twice , out of the tail of his eye through the ferns , low down .

&quot; There never was a fortune made that wasn &apos;t made by chancing it . &quot;

He nudged Smith to come to the point . Presently Smith asked , sulkily :

&quot; Well , what was he saying ? &quot;

&quot; I thought I told you ! He says he &apos;s behind the scenes in this gold boom ,
and , if he had a hundred pounds ready cash to @-@ morrow , he &apos;d make three of
it before Saturday . He said he could put one @-@ fifty to one @-@ fifty . &quot;

&quot; And isn &apos;t he worth three hundred ? &quot;

&quot; Didn &apos;t I tell you , &quot; demanded Steelman , with an impatient ring , and
speaking rapidly , &quot; that he lost his mail in the wreck of the &apos; Tasman &apos; ?
You know she went down the day before yesterday , and the divers haven &apos;t
got at the mails yet . &quot;

&quot; Yes .... But why doesn &apos;t he wire to Sydney for some stuff ? &quot;

&quot; I &apos;m -- -- ! Well , I suppose I &apos;ll have to have patience with a born
natural . Look here , Smith , the fact of the matter is that he &apos;s a sort of
black @-@ sheep -- sent out on the remittance system , if the truth is known ,
and with letters of introduction to some big @-@ bugs out here -- that
explains how he gets to know these wire @-@ pullers behind the boom . His
people have probably got the quarterly allowance business fixed hard
and tight with a bank or a lawyer in Sydney ; and there &apos;ll have to be
enquiries about the lost &apos; draft &apos; ( as he calls a cheque ) and a letter or
maybe a cable home to England ; and it might take weeks . &quot;

&quot; Yes , &quot; said Smith , hesitatingly . &quot; That all sounds right enough .
But &quot; -- with an inspiration -- &quot; why don &apos;t he go to one of these big @-@ bug
boomsters he knows -- that he got letters of introduction to -- and get him
to fix him up ? &quot;

&quot; Oh , Lord ! &quot; exclaimed Steelman , hopelessly . &quot; Listen to him ! Can &apos;t you
see that they &apos;re the last men he wants to let into his game ? Why , he
wants to use THEM ! They &apos;re the mugs as far as he is concerned ! &quot;

&quot; Oh -- I see ! &quot; said Smith , after hesitating , and rather slowly -- as if he
hadn &apos;t quite finished seeing yet .

Steelman glanced furtively at the fern @-@ screen , and nudged Smith again .

&quot; He said if he had three hundred , he &apos;d double it by Saturday ? &quot;

&quot; That &apos;s what he said , &quot; replied Steelman , seeming by his tone to be
losing interest in the conversation .

&quot; And ... well , if he had a hundred he could double that , I suppose . &quot;

&quot; Yes . What are you driving at now ? &quot;

&quot; If he had twenty -- -- &quot;

&quot; Oh , God ! I &apos;m sick of you , Smith . What the -- -- ! &quot;

&quot; Hold on . Let me finish . I was only going to say that I &apos;m willing to put
up a fiver , and you put up another fiver , and if he doubles that for us
then we can talk about standing in with him with a hundred -- provided he
can show his hundred . &quot;

After some snarling Steelman said : &quot; Well , I &apos;ll try him ! Now are you
satisfied ? &quot; ...

&quot; He &apos;s moved off now , &quot; he added in a whisper ; &quot; but stay here and talk a
bit longer . &quot;

Passing through the hall they saw Gentleman Sharper standing carelessly
by the door of the private bar . He jerked his head in the direction of
drinks . Steelman accepted the invitation -- Smith passed on . Steelman took
the opportunity to whisper to the Sharper -- &quot; I &apos;ve been talking that over
with my mate , and -- -- &quot;

&quot; Come for a stroll , &quot; suggested the professional .

&quot; I don &apos;t mind , &quot; said Steelman .

&quot; Have a cigar ? &quot; and they passed out .

When they returned Steelman went straight to the room he occupied with
Smith .

&quot; How much stuff have we got , Smith ? &quot;

&quot; Nine pounds seventeen and threepence . &quot;

Steelman gave an exclamation of disapproval with that state of financial
affairs . He thought a second . &quot; I know the barman here , and I think he
knows me . I &apos;ll chew his lug for a bob or may be a quid . &quot;

Twenty minutes later he went to Gentleman Sharper &apos;s room with ten
pounds -- in very dirty Bank of New Zealand notes -- such as those with
which bush contractors pay their men .

Two mornings later the sharper suggested a stroll . Steelman went with
him , with a face carefully made up to hear the worst .

After walking a hundred yards in a silence which might have been
ominous -- and was certainly pregnant -- the sharper said :

&quot; Well ... I tried the water . &quot;

&quot; Yes ! &quot; said Steelman in a nervous tone . &quot; And how did you find it ? &quot;

&quot; Just as warm as I thought . Warm for a big splash . &quot;

&quot; How ? Did you lose the ten quid ? &quot;

&quot; Lose it ! What did you take me for ? I put ten to your ten as I told you
I would . I landed 50 Pounds -- -- &quot;

&quot; Fifty pounds for twenty ? &quot;

&quot; That &apos;s the tune of it -- and not much of a tune , either . My God ! If I &apos;d
only had that thousand of mine by me , or even half of it , I &apos;d have made
a pile ! &quot;

&quot; Fifty pounds for twenty ! &quot; cried Steelman excitedly . &quot; Why , that &apos;s grand !
And to think we chaps have been grafting like niggers all our lives ! By
God , we &apos;ll stand in with you for all we &apos;ve got ! &quot;

&quot; There &apos;s my hand on it , &quot; as they reached the hotel .

&quot; If you come to my room I &apos;ll give you the 25 Pounds now , if you like . &quot;

&quot; Oh , that &apos;s all right , &quot; exclaimed Steelman impulsively ; &quot; you mustn &apos;t
think I don &apos;t -- -- &quot;

&quot; That &apos;s all right . Don &apos;t you say any more about it . You &apos;d best have the
stuff to @-@ night to show your mate . &quot;

&quot; Perhaps so ; he &apos;s a suspicious fool , but I made a bargain with him about
our last cheque . He can hang on to the stuff , and I can &apos;t . If I &apos;d been
on my own I &apos;d have blued it a week ago . Tell you what I &apos;ll do -- we &apos;ll
call our share ( Smith &apos;s and mine ) twenty quid . You take the odd fiver
for your trouble . &quot;

&quot; That looks fair enough . We &apos;ll call it twenty guineas to you and your
mate . We &apos;ll want him , you know . &quot;

In his own and Smith &apos;s room Steelman thoughtfully counted twenty @-@ one
sovereigns on the toilet @-@ table cover , and left them there in a pile .

He stretched himself , scratched behind his ear , and blinked at the money
abstractedly . Then he asked , as if the thought just occurred to him : &quot; By
the way , Smith , do you see those yellow boys ? &quot;

Smith saw . He had been sitting on the bed with a studiously vacant
expression . It was Smith &apos;s policy not to seem , except by request , to
take any interest in , or , in fact , to be aware of anything unusual that
Steelman might be doing -- from patching his pants to reading poetry .

&quot; There &apos;s twenty @-@ one sovereigns there ! &quot; remarked Steelman casually .

&quot; Yes ? &quot;

&quot; Ten of &apos; em &apos;s yours . &quot;

&quot; Thank yer , Steely . &quot;

&quot; And , &quot; added Steelman , solemnly and grimly , &quot; if you get taken down for
&apos;em , or lose &apos; em out of the top @-@ hole in your pocket , or spend so much as
a shilling in riotous living , I &apos;ll stoush you , Smith . &quot;

Smith didn &apos;t seem interested . They sat on the beds opposite each other
for two or three minutes , in something of the atmosphere that pervades
things when conversation has petered out and the dinner @-@ bell is expected
to ring . Smith screwed his face and squeezed a pimple on his throat ;
Steelman absently counted the flies on the wall . Presently Steelman ,
with a yawning sigh , lay back on the pillow with his hands clasped under
his head .

&quot; Better take a few quid , Smith , and get that suit you were looking
at the other day . Get a couple of shirts and collars , and some socks ;
better get a hat while you &apos;re at it -- yours is a disgrace to your
benefactor . And , I say , go to a chemist and get some cough stuff for
that churchyarder of yours -- we &apos;ve got no use for it just now , and it
makes me sentimental . I &apos;ll give you a cough when you want one . Bring me
a syphon of soda , some fruit , and a tract . &quot;

&quot; A what ? &quot;

&quot; A tract . Go on . Start your boots . &quot;

While Smith was gone , Steelman paced the room with a strange , worried ,
haunted expression . He divided the gold that was left -- ( Smith had taken
four pounds ) -- and put ten sovereigns in a pile on the extreme corner
of the table . Then he walked up and down , up and down the room , arms
tightly folded , and forehead knitted painfully , pausing abruptly now
and then by the table to stare at the gold , until he heard Smith &apos;s step .
Then his face cleared ; he sat down and counted flies .

Smith was undoing and inspecting the parcels , having placed the syphon
and fruit on the table . Behind his back Steelman hurriedly opened a
leather pocketbook and glanced at the portrait of a woman and child and
at the date of a post @-@ office order receipt .

&quot; Smith , &quot; said Steelman , &quot; we &apos;re two honest , ignorant , green coves ;
hard @-@ working chaps from the bush . &quot;

&quot; Yes . &quot;

&quot; It doesn &apos;t matter whether we are or not -- we are as far as the world
is concerned . Now we &apos;ve grafted like bullocks , in heat and wet , for six
months , and made a hundred and fifty , and come down to have a bit of a
holiday before going back to bullock for another six months or a year .
Isn &apos;t that so , Smith ? &quot;

&quot; Yes . &quot;

&quot; You could take your oath on it ? &quot;

&quot; Yes . &quot;

&quot; Well , it doesn &apos;t matter if it is so or not -- it IS so , so far as the
world is concerned . Now we &apos;ve paid our way straight . We &apos;ve always been
pretty straight anyway , even if we are a pair of vagabonds , and I don &apos;t
half like this new business ; but it had to be done . If I hadn &apos;t taken
down that sharper you &apos;d have lost confidence in me and wouldn &apos;t have
been able to mask your feelings , and I &apos;d have had to stoush you . We &apos;re
two hard @-@ working , innocent bushies , down for an innocent spree , and we
run against a cold @-@ blooded professional sharper , a paltry sneak and
a coward , who &apos;s got neither the brains nor the pluck to work in the
station of life he togs himself for . He tries to do us out of our
hard @-@ earned little hundred and fifty -- no matter whether we had it or
not -- and I &apos;m obliged to take him down . Serve him right for a crawler .
You haven &apos;t the least idea what I &apos;m driving at , Smith , and that &apos;s the
best of it . I &apos;ve driven a nail of my life home , and no pincers ever made
will get it out . &quot;

&quot; Why , Steely , what &apos;s the matter with you ? &quot;

Steelman rose , took up the pile of ten sovereigns , and placed it neatly
on top of the rest .

&quot; Put the stuff away , Smith . &quot;

After breakfast next morning , Gentleman Sharper hung round a bit , and
then suggested a stroll . But Steelman thought the weather looked
too bad , so they went on the balcony for a smoke . They talked of the
weather , wrecks , and things , Steelman leaning with his elbows on the
balcony rail , and Sharper sociably and confidently in the same position
close beside him . But the professional was evidently growing uneasy in
his mind ; his side of the conversation grew awkward and disjointed ,
and he made the blunder of drifting into an embarrassing silence before
coming to the point . He took one elbow from the rail , and said , with a
bungling attempt at carelessness which was made more transparent by the
awkward pause before it :

&quot; Ah , well , I must see to my correspondence . By the way , when could you
make it convenient to let me have that hundred ? The shares are starting
up the last rise now , and we &apos;ve got no time to lose if we want to double
it . &quot;

Steelman turned his face to him and winked once -- a very hard , tight ,
cold wink -- a wink in which there was no humour : such a wink as Steelman
had once winked at a half @-@ drunken bully who was going to have a lark
with Smith .

The sharper was one of those men who pull themselves together in a bad
cause , as they stagger from the blow . But he wanted to think this time .

Later on he approached Steelman quietly and proposed partnership . But
Steelman gave him to understand ( as between themselves ) that he wasn &apos;t
taking on any pupils just then .




An Incident at Stiffner &apos;s



They called him &quot; Stiffner &quot; because he used , long before , to get a living
by poisoning wild dogs near the Queensland border . The name stuck to
him closer than misfortune did , for when he rose to the proud and
independent position of landlord and sole proprietor of an out @-@ back pub
he was Stiffner still , and his place was &quot; Stiffner &apos;s &quot; -- widely known .

They do say that the name ceased not to be applicable -- that it fitted
even better than in the old dingo days , but -- well , they do say so . All
we can say is that when a shearer arrived with a cheque , and had a drink
or two , he was almost invariably seized with a desire to camp on the
premises for good , spend his cheque in the shortest possible time , and
forcibly shout for everything within hail -- including the Chinaman cook
and Stiffner &apos;s disreputable old ram .

The shanty was of the usual kind , and the scenery is as easily disposed
of . There was a great grey plain stretching away from the door in front ,
and a mulga scrub from the rear ; and in that scrub , not fifty yards from
the kitchen door , were half a dozen nameless graves .

Stiffner was always drunk , and Stiffner &apos;s wife -- a hard @-@ featured
Amazon -- was boss . The children were brought up in a detached cottage ,
under the care of a &quot; governess &quot; .

Stiffner had a barmaid as a bait for chequemen . She came from Sydney ,
they said , and her name was Alice . She was tall , boyishly handsome , and
characterless ; her figure might be described as &quot; fine &quot; or &quot; strapping &quot; ,
but her face was very cold -- nearly colourless . She was one of those
selfishly sensual women -- thin lips , and hard , almost vacant grey eyes ;
no thought of anything but her own pleasures , none for the man &apos;s . Some
shearers would roughly call her &quot; a squatter &apos;s girl &quot; . But she &quot; drew &quot; ;
she was handsome where women are scarce -- very handsome , thought a
tall , melancholy @-@ looking jackeroo , whose evil spirit had drawn him to
Stiffner &apos;s and the last shilling out of his pocket .

Over the great grey plain , about a fortnight before , had come &quot; Old
Danny &quot; , a station hand , for his semi @-@ annual spree , and one &quot; Yankee Jack &quot;
and his mate , shearers with horses , travelling for grass ; and , about a
week later , the Sydney jackeroo . There was also a sprinkling of assorted
swagmen , who came in through the scrub and went out across the plain ,
or came in over the plain and went away through the scrub , according to
which way their noses led them for the time being .

There was also , for one day , a tall , freckled native ( son of a
neighbouring &quot; cocky &quot; ) , without a thought beyond the narrow horizon
within which he lived . He had a very big opinion of himself in a very
small mind . He swaggered into the breakfast @-@ room and round the table to
his place with an expression of ignorant contempt on his phiz , his
snub nose in the air and his under lip out . But during the meal he
condescended to ask the landlord if he &apos;d noticed that there horse that
chap was ridin &apos; yesterday ; and Stiffner having intimated that he had ,
the native entertained the company with his opinion of that horse , and
of a certain &quot; youngster &quot; he was breaking in at home , and divers other
horses , mostly his or his father &apos;s , and of a certain cattle slut , &amp; c ....
He spoke at the landlord , but to the company , most of the time . After
breakfast he swaggered round some more , but condescended to &quot; shove &quot;
his hand into his trousers , &quot; pull &quot; out a &quot; bob &quot; and &quot; chuck &quot; it into the
( blanky ) hat for a pool . Those words express the thing better than any
others we can think of . Finally , he said he must be off ; and , there
being no opposition to his departure , he chucked his saddle on to his
horse , chucked himself into the saddle , said &quot; s &apos;long , &quot; and slithered
off . And no one missed him .

Danny had been there a fortnight , and consequently his personal
appearance was not now worth describing -- it was better left alone ,
for the honour of the bush . His hobby was that he was the &quot; stranger &apos;s
friend &quot; , as he put it . He &apos;d welcome &quot; the stranger &quot; and chum with him ,
and shout for him to an unlimited extent , and sympathise with him , hear
of jobs or a &quot; show &quot; for him , assure him twenty times a day that he was
his friend , give him hints and advice more or less worthless , make him
drunk if possible , and keep him so while the cheque lasted ; in short ,
Danny would do almost anything for the stranger except lend him a
shilling , or give him some rations to carry him on . He &apos;d promise that
many times a day , but he &apos;d sooner spend five pounds on drink for a man
than give him a farthing .

Danny &apos;s cheque was nearly gone , and it was time he was gone too ; in
fact , he had received , and was still receiving , various hints to that
effect , some of them decidedly pointed , especially the more recent ones .
But Danny was of late becoming foolishly obstinate in his sprees , and
less disposed to &quot; git &quot; when a landlord had done with him . He saw the
hints plainly enough , but had evidently made up his mind to be doggedly
irresponsive . It is a mistake to think that drink always dulls a
man &apos;s feelings . Some natures are all the more keenly sensitive when
alcoholically poisoned .

Danny was always front man at the shanty while his cheque was fresh -- at
least , so he was given to understand , and so he apparently understood .
He was then allowed to say and do what he liked almost , even to mauling
the barmaid about . There was scarcely any limit to the free and easy
manner in which you could treat her , so long as your money lasted . She
wouldn &apos;t be offended ; it wasn &apos;t business to be so -- &quot; didn &apos;t pay . &quot; But , as
soon as your title to the cheque could be decently shelved , you had to
treat her like a lady . Danny knew this -- none better ; but he had been
treated with too much latitude , and rushed to his destruction .

It was Sunday afternoon , but that made no difference in things at the
shanty . Dinner was just over . The men were in the mean little parlour
off the bar , interested in a game of cards , and Alice sat in one corner
sewing . Danny was &quot; acting the goat &quot; round the fireplace ; as ill @-@ luck
would have it , his attention was drawn to a basket of clean linen which
stood on the side table , and from it , with sundry winks and grimaces ,
he gingerly lifted a certain garment of ladies &apos; underwear -- to put the
matter decently . He held it up between his forefingers and thumbs , and
cracked a rough , foolish joke -- no matter what it was . The laugh didn &apos;t
last long . Alice sprang to her feet , flinging her work aside , and struck
a stage attitude -- her right arm thrown out and the forefinger pointing
rigidly , and rather crookedly , towards the door .

&quot; Leave the room ! &quot; she snapped at Danny . &quot; Leave the room ! How dare you
talk like that before me @-@ e @-@ ee ! &quot;

Danny made a step and paused irresolutely . He was sober enough to feel
the humiliation of his position , and having once been a man of spirit ,
and having still the remnants of manhood about him , he did feel it . He
gave one pitiful , appealing look at her face , but saw no mercy there .
She stamped her foot again , jabbed her forefinger at the door , and said ,
&quot; Go @-@ o @-@ o ! &quot; in a tone that startled the majority of the company nearly as
much as it did Danny . Then Yankee Jack threw down his cards , rose from
the table , laid his strong , shapely right hand -- not roughly -- on Danny &apos;s
ragged shoulder , and engineered the drunk gently through the door .

&quot; You &apos;s better go out for a while , Danny , &quot; he said ; &quot; there wasn &apos;t much
harm in what you said , but your cheque &apos;s gone , and that makes all the
difference . It &apos;s time you went back to the station . You &apos;ve got to be
careful what you say now . &quot;

When Jack returned to the parlour the barmaid had a smile for him ; but
he didn &apos;t take it . He went and stood before the fire , with his foot
resting on the fender and his elbow on the mantelshelf , and looked
blackly at a print against the wall before his face .

&quot; The old beast ! &quot; said Alice , referring to Danny . &quot; He ought to be kicked
off the place ! &quot;

&quot; HE &apos;S AS GOOD AS YOU ! &quot;

The voice was Jack &apos;s ; he flung the stab over his shoulder , and with it a
look that carried all the contempt he felt .

She gasped , looked blankly from face to face , and witheringly at the
back of Jack &apos;s head ; but that didn &apos;t change colour or curl the least
trifle less closely .

&quot; Did you hear that ? &quot; she cried , appealing to anyone . &quot; You &apos;re a nice lot
o &apos; men , you are , to sit there and hear a woman insulted , and not one of
you man enough to take her part -- cowards ! &quot;

The Sydney jackeroo rose impulsively , but Jack glanced at him , and he
sat down again . She covered her face with her hands and ran hysterically
to her room .

That afternoon another bushman arrived with a cheque , and shouted five
times running at a pound a shout , and at intervals during the rest of
the day when they weren &apos;t fighting or gambling .

Alice had &quot; got over her temper &quot; seemingly , and was even kind to the
humble and contrite Danny , who became painfully particular with his
&quot; Thanky , Alice &quot; -- and afterwards offensive with his unnecessarily
frequent threats to smash the first man who insulted her .

But let us draw the curtain close before that Sunday afternoon at
Stiffner &apos;s , and hold it tight . Behind it the great curse of the West is
in evidence , the chief trouble of unionism -- drink , in its most selfish ,
barren , and useless form .

. . . . .

All was quiet at Stiffner &apos;s . It was after midnight , and Stiffner lay
dead @-@ drunk on the broad of his back on the long moonlit verandah ,
with all his patrons asleep around him in various grotesque positions .
Stiffner &apos;s ragged grey head was on a cushion , and a broad maudlin smile
on his red , drink @-@ sodden face , the lower half of which was bordered by
a dirty grey beard , like that of a frilled lizard . The red handkerchief
twisted round his neck had a ghastly effect in the bright moonlight ,
making him look as if his throat was cut . The smile was the one he
went to sleep with when his wife slipped the cushion under his head and
thoughtfully removed the loose change from about his person . Near him
lay a heap that was Danny , and spread over the bare boards were the
others , some with heads pillowed on their swags , and every man about as
drunk as his neighbour . Yankee Jack lay across the door of the barmaid &apos;s
bedroom , with one arm bent under his head , the other lying limp on the
doorstep , his handsome face turned out to the bright moonlight . The
&quot; family &quot; were sound asleep in the detached cottage , and Alice -- the only
capable person on the premises -- was left to put out the lamps and &quot; shut
up &quot; for the night . She extinguished the light in the bar , came out ,
locked the door , and picked her way among and over the drunkards to the
end of the verandah . She clasped her hands behind her head , stretched
herself , and yawned , and then stood for a few moments looking out into
the night , which softened the ragged line of mulga to right and
left , and veiled the awful horizon of that great plain with which the
&quot; traveller &quot; commenced , or ended , the thirty @-@ mile &quot; dry stretch &quot; . Then she
moved towards her own door ; before it she halted and stood , with folded
arms , looking down at the drunken Adonis at her feet .

She breathed a long breath with a sigh in it , went round to the back ,
and presently returned with a buggy @-@ cushion , which she slipped under his
head -- her face close to his -- very close . Then she moved his arms gently
off the threshold , stepped across him into her room , and locked the door
behind her .

There was an uneasy movement in the heap that stood , or lay , for Danny .
It stretched out , turned over , struggled to its hands and knees , and
became an object . Then it crawled to the wall , against which it
slowly and painfully up @-@ ended itself , and stood blinking round for
the water @-@ bag , which hung from the verandah rafters in a line with its
shapeless red nose . It staggered forward , held on by the cords , felt
round the edge of the bag for the tot , and drank about a quart of water .
Then it staggered back against the wall , stood for a moment muttering
and passing its hand aimlessly over its poor ruined head , and finally
collapsed into a shapeless rum @-@ smelling heap and slept once more .

The jackeroo at the end of the verandah had awakened from his drunken
sleep , but had not moved . He lay huddled on his side , with his head on
the swag ; the whole length of the verandah was before him ; his eyes
were wide open , but his face was in the shade . Now he rose painfully and
stood on the ground outside , with his hands in his pockets , and gazed
out over the open for a while . He breathed a long breath , too -- with a
groan in it . Then he lifted his swag quietly from the end of the floor ,
shouldered it , took up his water @-@ bag and billy , and sneaked over the
road , away from the place , like a thief . He struck across the plain , and
tramped on , hour after hour , mile after mile , till the bright moon went
down with a bright star in attendance and the other bright stars waned ,
and he entered the timber and tramped through it to the &quot; cleared road &quot; ,
which stretched far and wide for twenty miles before him , with ghostly
little dust @-@ clouds at short intervals ahead , where the frightened
rabbits crossed it . And still he went doggedly on , with the ghastly
daylight on him -- like a swagman &apos;s ghost out late . And a mongrel followed
faithfully all the time unnoticed , and wondering , perhaps , at his
master .

&quot; What was yer doin &apos; to that girl yesterday ? &quot; asked Danny of Yankee Jack
next evening , as they camped on the far side of the plain . &quot; What was you
chaps sayin &apos; to Alice ? I heerd her cryin &apos; in her room last night . &quot;

But they reckoned that he had been too drunk to hear anything except an
invitation to come and have another drink ; and so it passed .




The Hero of Redclay



The &quot; boss @-@ over @-@ the @-@ board &quot; was leaning with his back to the wall between
two shoots , reading a reference handed to him by a green @-@ hand applying
for work as picker @-@ up or woolroller -- a shed rouseabout . It was terribly
hot . I was slipping past to the rolling @-@ tables , carrying three fleeces
to save a journey ; we were only supposed to carry two . The boss stopped
me :

&quot; You &apos;ve got three fleeces there , young man ? &quot;

&quot; Yes . &quot;

Notwithstanding the fact that I had just slipped a light ragged fleece
into the belly @-@ wool and &quot; bits &quot; basket , I felt deeply injured , and
righteously and fiercely indignant at being pulled up . It was a
fearfully hot day .

&quot; If I catch you carrying three fleeces again , &quot; said the boss quietly ,
&quot; I &apos;ll give you the sack . &quot;

&quot; I &apos;ll take it now if you like , &quot; I said .

He nodded . &quot; You can go on picking @-@ up in this man &apos;s place , &quot; he said
to the jackeroo , whose reference showed him to be a non @-@ union man -- a
&quot; free @-@ labourer &quot; , as the pastoralists had it , or , in plain shed terms , &quot; a
blanky scab &quot; . He was now in the comfortable position of a non @-@ unionist
in a union shed who had jumped into a sacked man &apos;s place .

Somehow the lurid sympathy of the men irritated me worse than the
boss @-@ over @-@ the @-@ board had done . It must have been on account of the heat ,
as Mitchell says . I was sick of the shed and the life . It was within a
couple of days of cut @-@ out , so I told Mitchell -- who was shearing -- that
I &apos;d camp up the Billabong and wait for him ; got my cheque , rolled up
my swag , got three days &apos; tucker from the cook , said so @-@ long to him , and
tramped while the men were in the shed .

I camped at the head of the Billabong where the track branched , one
branch running to Bourke , up the river , and the other out towards the
Paroo -- and hell .

About ten o &apos;clock the third morning Mitchell came along with his cheque
and his swag , and a new sheep @-@ pup , and his quiet grin ; and I wasn &apos;t too
pleased to see that he had a shearer called &quot; the Lachlan &quot; with him .

The Lachlan wasn &apos;t popular at the shed . He was a brooding , unsociable
sort of man , and it didn &apos;t make any difference to the chaps whether he
had a union ticket or not . It was pretty well known in the shed -- there
were three or four chaps from the district he was reared in -- that he &apos;d
done five years hard for burglary . What surprised me was that Jack
Mitchell seemed thick with him ; often , when the Lachlan was sitting
brooding and smoking by himself outside the hut after sunset , Mitchell
would perch on his heels alongside him and yarn . But no one else took
notice of anything Mitchell did out of the common .

&quot; Better camp with us till the cool of the evening , &quot; said Mitchell to
the Lachlan , as they slipped their swags . &quot; Plenty time for you to start
after sundown , if you &apos;re going to travel to @-@ night . &quot;

So the Lachlan was going to travel all night and on a different track . I
felt more comfortable , and put the billy on . I did not care so much what
he &apos;d been or had done , but I was green and soft yet , and his presence
embarrassed me .

They talked shearing , sheds , tracks , and a little unionism -- the Lachlan
speaking in a quiet voice and with a lot of sound , common sense , it
seemed to me . He was tall and gaunt , and might have been thirty , or even
well on in the forties . His eyes were dark brown and deep set , and had
something of the dead @-@ earnest sad expression you saw in the eyes of
union leaders and secretaries -- the straight men of the strikes of &apos; 90
and &apos; 91 . I fancied once or twice I saw in his eyes the sudden furtive
look of the &quot; bad egg &quot; when a mounted trooper is spotted near the shed ;
but perhaps this was prejudice . And with it all there was about the
Lachlan something of the man who has lost all he had and the chances
of all he was ever likely to have , and is past feeling , or caring , or
flaring up -- past getting mad about anything -- something , all the same ,
that warned men not to make free with him .

He and Mitchell fished along the Billabong all the afternoon ; I fished
a little , and lay about the camp and read . I had an instinct that the
Lachlan saw I didn &apos;t cotton on to his camping with us , though he wasn &apos;t
the sort of man to show what he saw or felt . After tea , and a smoke at
sunset , he shouldered his swag , nodded to me as if I was an accidental
but respectful stranger at a funeral that belonged to him , and took the
outside track . Mitchell walked along the track with him for a mile or
so , while I poked round and got some boughs down for a bed , and fed and
studied the collie pup that Jack had bought from the shearers &apos; cook .

I saw them stop and shake hands out on the dusty clearing , and they
seemed to take a long time about it ; then Mitchell started back , and
the other began to dwindle down to a black peg and then to a dot on the
sandy plain , that had just a hint of dusk and dreamy far @-@ away gloaming
on it between the change from glaring day to hard , bare , broad
moonlight .

I thought Mitchell was sulky , or had got the blues , when he came back ;
he lay on his elbow smoking , with his face turned from the camp towards
the plain . After a bit I got wild -- if Mitchell was going to go on like
that he might as well have taken his swag and gone with the Lachlan . I
don &apos;t know exactly what was the matter with me that day , and at last I
made up my mind to bring the thing to a head .

&quot; You seem mighty thick with the Lachlan , &quot; I said .

&quot; Well , what &apos;s the matter with that ? &quot; asked Mitchell . &quot; It ain &apos;t the first
felon I &apos;ve been on speaking terms with . I borrowed half @-@ a @-@ caser off a
murderer once , when I was in a hole and had no one else to go to ; and
the murderer hadn &apos;t served his time , neither . I &apos;ve got nothing against
the Lachlan , except that he &apos;s a white man and bears a faint family
resemblance to a certain branch of my tribe . &quot;

I rolled out my swag on the boughs , got my pipe , tobacco , and matches
handy in the crown of a spare hat , and lay down .

Mitchell got up , re @-@ lit his pipe at the fire , and mooned round for
a while , with his hands behind him , kicking sticks out of the road ,
looking out over the plain , down along the Billabong , and up through the
mulga branches at the stars ; then he comforted the pup a bit , shoved the
fire together with his toe , stood the tea @-@ billy on the coals , and came
and squatted on the sand by my head .

&quot; Joe ! I &apos;ll tell you a yarn . &quot;

&quot; All right ; fire away ! Has it got anything to do with the Lachlan ? &quot;

&quot; No . It &apos;s got nothing to do with the Lachlan now ; but it &apos;s about a chap
he knew . Don &apos;t you ever breathe a word of this to the Lachlan or anyone ,
or he &apos;ll get on to me . &quot;

&quot; All right . Go ahead . &quot;

&quot; You know I &apos;ve been a good many things in my time . I did a deal of
house @-@ painting at one time ; I was a pretty smart brush hand , and made
money at it . Well , I had a run of work at a place called Redclay , on the
Lachlan side . You know the sort of town -- two pubs , a general store , a
post office , a blacksmith &apos;s shop , a police station , a branch bank , and
a dozen private weatherboard boxes on piles , with galvanized @-@ iron tops ,
besides the humpies . There was a paper there , too , called the &apos; Redclay
Advertiser &apos; ( with which was incorporated the &apos; Geebung Chronicle &apos; ) , and
a Roman Catholic church , a Church of England , and a Wesleyan chapel .
Now you see more of private life in the house @-@ painting line than in
any other -- bar plumbing and gasfitting ; but I &apos;ll tell you about my
house @-@ painting experiences some other time .

&quot; There was a young chap named Jack Drew editing the &apos; Advertiser &apos; then .
He belonged to the district , but had been sent to Sydney to a grammar
school when he was a boy . He was between twenty @-@ five and thirty ; had
knocked round a good deal , and gone the pace in Sydney . He got on as a
boy reporter on one of the big dailies ; he had brains and could
write rings round a good many , but he got in with a crowd that called
themselves &apos; Bohemians &apos; , and the drink got a hold on him . The paper stuck
to him as long as it could ( for the sake of his brains ) , but they had to
sack him at last .

&quot; He went out back , as most of them do , to try and work out their
salvation , and knocked round amongst the sheds . He &apos; picked up &apos; in one
shed where I was shearing , and we carried swags together for a couple
of months . Then he went back to the Lachlan side , and prospected amongst
the old fields round there with his elder brother Tom , who was all there
was left of his family . Tom , by the way , broke his heart digging Jack
out of a cave in a drive they were working , and died a few minutes after
the rescue . &#91; * &#93; But that &apos;s another yarn . Jack Drew had a bad spree after
that ; then he went to Sydney again , got on his old paper , went to the
dogs , and a Parliamentary push that owned some city fly @-@ blisters and
country papers sent him up to edit the &apos; Advertiser &apos; at two quid a
week . He drank again , and no wonder -- you don &apos;t know what it is to run a
&apos;Geebung Advocate &apos; or &apos; Mudgee Budgee Chronicle &apos; , and live there . He was
about the same build as the Lachlan , but stouter , and had something the
same kind of eyes ; but he was ordinarily as careless and devil @-@ may @-@ care
as the Lachlan is grumpy and quiet .

* See &quot; When the Sun Went Down &quot; , in &quot; While the
Billy Boils &quot; . --

&quot; There was a doctor there , called Dr. Lebinski . They said he was a
Polish exile . He was fifty or sixty , a tall man , with the set of an
old soldier when he stood straight ; but he mostly walked with his hands
behind him , studying the ground . Jack Drew caught that trick off
him towards the end . They were chums in a gloomy way , and kept to
themselves -- they were the only two men with brains in that town . They
drank and fought the drink together . The Doctor was too gloomy and
impatient over little things to be popular . Jack Drew talked too
straight in the paper , and in spite of his proprietors -- about pub
spieling and such things -- and was too sarcastic in his progress
committee , town council , and toady reception reports . The Doctor had a
hawk &apos;s nose , pointed grizzled beard and moustache , and steely @-@ grey eyes
with a haunted look in them sometimes ( especially when he glanced at you
sideways ) , as if he loathed his fellow men , and couldn &apos;t always hide it ;
or as if you were the spirit of morphia or opium , or a dead girl he &apos;d
wronged in his youth -- or whatever his devil was , beside drink . He was
clever , and drink had brought him down to Redclay .

&quot; The bank manager was a heavy snob named Browne . He complained of being
a bit dull of hearing in one ear -- after you &apos;d yelled at him three or
four times ; sometimes I &apos;ve thought he was as deaf as a book @-@ keeper in
both . He had a wife and youngsters , but they were away on a visit while
I was working in Redclay . His niece -- or , rather , his wife &apos;s niece -- a
girl named Ruth Wilson , did the housekeeping . She was an orphan ,
adopted by her aunt , and was general slavey and scape @-@ goat to the
family -- especially to the brats , as is often the case . She was rather
pretty , and lady @-@ like , and kept to herself . The women and girls called
her Miss Wilson , and didn &apos;t like her . Most of the single men -- and some
of the married ones , perhaps -- were gone on her , but hadn &apos;t the brains
or the pluck to bear up and try their luck . I was gone worse than any , I
think , but had too much experience or common sense . She was very good to
me -- used to hand me out cups of tea and plates of sandwiches , or bread
and butter , or cake , mornings and afternoons the whole time I was
painting the bank . The Doctor had known her people and was very kind
to her . She was about the only woman -- for she was more woman than
girl -- that he &apos;d brighten up and talk for . Neither he nor Jack Drew were
particularly friendly with Browne or his push .

&quot; The banker , the storekeeper , one of the publicans , the butcher ( a
popular man with his hands in his pockets , his hat on the back of his
head , and nothing in it ) , the postmaster , and his toady , the lightning
squirter , were the scrub @-@ aristocracy . The rest were crawlers , mostly pub
spielers and bush larrikins , and the women were hags and larrikinesses .
The town lived on cheque @-@ men from the surrounding bush . It was a nice
little place , taking it all round .

&quot; I remember a ball at the local town hall , where the scrub aristocrats
took one end of the room to dance in and the ordinary scum the other .
It was a saving in music . Some day an Australian writer will come along
who &apos;ll remind the critics and readers of Dickens , Carlyle , and Thackeray
mixed , and he &apos;ll do justice to these little customs of ours in the
little settled @-@ district towns of Democratic Australia . This sort of
thing came to a head one New Year &apos;s Night at Redclay , when there was a
&apos;public &apos; ball and peace on earth and good will towards all men -- mostly
on account of a railway to Redclay being surveyed . We were all there .
They &apos;d got the Doc. out of his shell to act as M.C.

&quot; One of the aristocrats was the daughter of the local storekeeper ;
she belonged to the lawn @-@ tennis clique , and they WERE select . For some
reason or other -- because she looked upon Miss Wilson as a slavey , or
on account of a fancied slight , or the heat working on ignorance , or on
account of something that comes over girls and women that no son of sin
can account for -- this Miss Tea- &apos; n &apos; -sugar tossed her head and refused
Miss Wilson &apos;s hand in the first set and so broke the ladies &apos; chain and
the dance . Then there was a to @-@ do . The Doctor held up his hand to stop
the music , and said , very quietly , that he must call upon Miss So @-@ and @-@ so
to apologise to Miss Wilson -- or resign the chair . After a lot of fuss
the girl did apologise in a snappy way that was another insult . Jack
Drew gave Miss Wilson his arm and marched her off without a word -- I saw
she was almost crying . Some one said , &apos; Oh , let &apos;s go on with the dance . &apos; 
The Doctor flashed round on them , but they were too paltry for him , so
he turned on his heel and went out without a word . But I was beneath
them again in social standing , so there was nothing to prevent me from
making a few well @-@ chosen remarks on things in general -- which I did ; and
broke up that ball , and broke some heads afterwards , and got myself a
good deal of hatred and respect , and two sweethearts ; and lost all the
jobs I was likely to get , except at the bank , the Doctor &apos;s , and the
Royal .

&quot; One day it was raining -- general rain for a week . Rain , rain , rain , over
ridge and scrub and galvanised iron and into the dismal creeks . I &apos;d done
all my inside work , except a bit under the Doctor &apos;s verandah , where he &apos;d
been having some patching and altering done round the glass doors of his
surgery , where he consulted his patients . I didn &apos;t want to lose time . It
was a Monday and no day for the Royal , and there was no dust , so it was
a good day for varnishing . I took a pot and brush and went along to give
the Doctor &apos;s doors a coat of varnish . The Doctor and Drew were inside
with a fire , drinking whisky and smoking , but I didn &apos;t know that when
I started work . The rain roared on the iron roof like the sea . All of a
sudden it held up for a minute , and I heard their voices . The doctor
had been shouting on account of the rain , and forgot to lower his voice .
&apos;Look here , Jack Drew , &apos; he said , &apos; there are only two things for you
to do if you have any regard for that girl ; one is to stop this &apos; ( the
liquor I suppose he meant ) &apos; and pull yourself together ; and I don &apos;t
think you &apos;ll do that -- I know men . The other is to throw up the
&apos;Advertiser &apos; -- it &apos;s doing you no good -- and clear out . &apos; &apos; I won &apos;t do that , &apos;
says Drew . &apos; Then shoot yourself , &apos; said the Doctor . &apos; ( There &apos;s another
flask in the cupboard ) . You know what this hole is like .... She &apos;s a good
true girl -- a girl as God made her . I knew her father and mother , and I
tell you , Jack , I &apos;d sooner see her dead than .... &apos; The roof roared again .
I felt a bit delicate about the business and didn &apos;t like to disturb
them , so I knocked off for the day .

&quot; About a week before that I was down in the bed of the Redclay Creek
fishing for &apos; tailers &apos; . I &apos;d been getting on all right with the housemaid
at the &apos; Royal &apos; -- she used to have plates of pudding and hot pie for me on
the big gridiron arrangement over the kitchen range ; and after the third
tuck @-@ out I thought it was good enough to do a bit of a bear @-@ up in that
direction . She mentioned one day , yarning , that she liked a stroll by
the creek sometimes in the cool of the evening . I thought she &apos;d be off
that day , so I said I &apos;d go for a fish after I &apos;d knocked off . I thought
I might get a bite . Anyway , I didn &apos;t catch Lizzie -- tell you about that
some other time .

&quot; It was Sunday . I &apos;d been fishing for Lizzie about an hour when I saw a
skirt on the bank out of the tail of my eye -- and thought I &apos;d got a bite ,
sure . But I was had . It was Miss Wilson strolling along the bank in the
sunset , all by her pretty self . She was a slight girl , not very tall ,
with reddish frizzled hair , grey eyes , and small , pretty features . She
spoke as if she had more brains than the average , and had been better
educated . Jack Drew was the only young man in Redclay she could talk to ,
or who could talk to a girl like her ; and that was the whole trouble in
a nutshell . The newspaper office was next to the bank , and I &apos;d seen her
hand cups of tea and cocoa over the fence to his office window more than
once , and sometimes they yarned for a while .

&quot; She said , &apos; Good morning , Mr. Mitchell . &apos; 

&quot; I said , &apos; Good morning , Miss . &apos; 

&quot; There &apos;s some girls I can &apos;t talk to like I &apos;d talk to other girls . She
asked me if I &apos;d caught any fish , and I said , &apos; No , Miss . &apos; She asked me if
it wasn &apos;t me down there fishing with Mr. Drew the other evening , and I
said , &apos; Yes -- it was me . &apos; Then presently she asked me straight if he
was fishing down the creek that afternoon ? I guessed they &apos;d been down
fishing for each other before . I said , &apos; No , I thought he was out of
town . &apos; I knew he was pretty bad at the Royal . I asked her if she &apos;d like
to have a try with my line , but she said No , thanks , she must be going ;
and she went off up the creek . I reckoned Jack Drew had got a bite and
landed her . I felt a bit sorry for her , too .

&quot; The next Saturday evening after the rainy Monday at the Doctor &apos;s , I
went down to fish for tailers -- and Lizzie . I went down under the banks
to where there was a big she @-@ oak stump half in the water , going quietly ,
with an idea of not frightening the fish . I was just unwinding the line
from my rod , when I noticed the end of another rod sticking out from
the other side of the stump ; and while I watched it was dropped into the
water . Then I heard a murmur , and craned my neck round the back of
the stump to see who it was . I saw the back view of Jack Drew and
Miss Wilson ; he had his arm round her waist , and her head was on his
shoulder . She said , &apos; I WILL trust you , Jack -- I know you &apos;ll give up the
drink for my sake . And I &apos;ll help you , and we &apos;ll be so happy ! &apos; or words
in that direction . A thunderstorm was coming on . The sky had darkened
up with a great blue @-@ black storm @-@ cloud rushing over , and they hadn &apos;t
noticed it . I didn &apos;t mind , and the fish bit best in a storm . But just
as she said &apos; happy &apos; came a blinding flash and a crash that shook the
ridges , and the first drops came peltering down . They jumped up and
climbed the bank , while I perched on the she @-@ oak roots over the water to
be out of sight as they passed . Half way to the town I saw them standing
in the shelter of an old stone chimney that stood alone . He had his
overcoat round her and was sheltering her from the wind .... &quot;

&quot; Smoke @-@ oh , Joe . The tea &apos;s stewing . &quot;

Mitchell got up , stretched himself , and brought the billy and pint @-@ pots
to the head of my camp . The moon had grown misty . The plain horizon
had closed in . A couple of boughs , hanging from the gnarled and blasted
timber over the billabong , were the perfect shapes of two men hanging
side by side . Mitchell scratched the back of his neck and looked down at
the pup curled like a glob of mud on the sand in the moonlight , and an
idea struck him . He got a big old felt hat he had , lifted his pup , nose
to tail , fitted it in the hat , shook it down , holding the hat by the
brim , and stood the hat near the head of his doss , out of the moonlight .
&quot; He might get moonstruck , &quot; said Mitchell , &quot; and I don &apos;t want that pup
to be a genius . &quot; The pup seemed perfectly satisfied with this new
arrangement .

&quot; Have a smoke , &quot; said Mitchell . &quot; You see , &quot; he added , with a sly grin ,
&quot; I &apos;ve got to make up the yarn as I go along , and it &apos;s hard work . It
seems to begin to remind me of yarns your grandmother or aunt tells of
things that happened when she was a girl -- but those yarns are true . You
won &apos;t have to listen long now ; I &apos;m well on into the second volume .

&quot; After the storm I hurried home to the tent -- I was batching with a
carpenter . I changed my clothes , made a fire in the fire @-@ bucket with
shavings and ends of soft wood , boiled the billy , and had a cup of
coffee . It was Saturday night . My mate was at the Royal ; it was cold and
dismal in the tent , and there was nothing to read , so I reckoned I might
as well go up to the Royal , too , and put in the time .

&quot; I had to pass the Bank on the way . It was the usual weatherboard box
with a galvanised iron top -- four rooms and a passage , and a detached
kitchen and wash @-@ house at the back ; the front room to the right ( behind
the office ) was the family bedroom , and the one opposite it was the
living room . The &apos; Advertiser &apos; office was next door . Jack Drew camped
in a skillion room behind his printing office , and had his meals at the
Royal . I noticed the storm had taken a sheet of iron off the
skillion , and supposed he &apos;d sleep at the Royal that night . Next to the
&apos;Advertiser &apos; office was the police station ( still called the Police
Camp ) and the Courthouse . Next was the Imperial Hotel , where the scrub
aristocrats went . There was a vacant allotment on the other side of the
Bank , and I took a short cut across this to the Royal .

&quot; They &apos;d forgotten to pull down the blind of the dining @-@ room window , and
I happened to glance through and saw she had Jack Drew in there and was
giving him a cup of tea . He had a bad cold , I remember , and I suppose
his health had got precious to her , poor girl . As I glanced she stepped
to the window and pulled down the blind , which put me out of face a
bit -- though , of course , she hadn &apos;t seen me . I was rather surprised at
her having Jack in there , till I heard that the banker , the postmaster ,
the constable , and some others were making a night of it at the
Imperial , as they &apos;d been doing pretty often lately -- and went on doing
till there was a blow @-@ up about it , and the constable got transferred
Out Back . I used to drink my share then . We smoked and played cards
and yarned and filled &apos; em up again at the Royal till after one in the
morning . Then I started home .

&quot; I &apos;d finished giving the Bank a couple of coats of stone @-@ colour that
week , and was cutting in in dark colour round the spouting , doors , and
window @-@ frames that Saturday . My head was pretty clear going home , and as
I passed the place it struck me that I &apos;d left out the only varnish brush
I had . I &apos;d been using it to give the sashes a coat of varnish colour ,
and remembered that I &apos;d left it on one of the window @-@ sills -- the sill
of her bedroom window , as it happened . I knew I &apos;d sleep in next day ,
Sunday , and guessed it would be hot , and I didn &apos;t want the varnish tool
to get spoiled ; so I reckoned I &apos;d slip in through the side gate , get it ,
and take it home to camp and put it in oil . The window sash was jammed ,
I remember , and I hadn &apos;t been able to get it up more than a couple of
inches to paint the runs of the sash . The grass grew up close under
the window , and I slipped in quietly . I noticed the sash was still up
a couple of inches . Just as I grabbed the brush I heard low voices
inside -- Ruth Wilson &apos;s and Jack Drew &apos;s -- in her room .

&quot; The surprise sent about a pint of beer up into my throat in a lump . I
tip @-@ toed away out of there . Just as I got clear of the gate I saw the
banker being helped home by a couple of cronies .

&quot; I went home to the camp and turned in , but I couldn &apos;t sleep . I lay
think -- think -- thinking , till I thought all the drink out of my head . I &apos;d
brought a bottle of ale home to last over Sunday , and I drank that . It
only made matters worse . I didn &apos;t know how I felt -- I -- well , I felt as
if I was as good a man as Jack Drew -- I -- you see I &apos;ve -- you might think it
soft -- but I loved that girl , not as I &apos;ve been gone on other girls , but
in the old @-@ fashioned , soft , honest , hopeless , far @-@ away sort of way ; and
now , to tell the straight truth , I thought I might have had her . You
lose a thing through being too straight or sentimental , or not having
enough cheek ; and another man comes along with more brass in his blood
and less sentimental rot and takes it up -- and the world respects him ;
and you feel in your heart that you &apos;re a weaker man than he is . Why ,
part of the time I must have felt like a man does when a better man
runs away with his wife . But I &apos;d drunk a lot , and was upset and
lonely @-@ feeling that night .

&quot; Oh , but Redclay had a tremendous sensation next day ! Jack Drew , of all
the men in the world , had been caught in the act of robbing the bank .
According to Browne &apos;s account in court and in the newspapers , he
returned home that night at about twelve o &apos;clock ( which I knew was a
lie , for I saw him being helped home nearer two ) and immediately retired
to rest ( on top of the quilt , boots and all , I suppose ) . Some time
before daybreak he was roused by a fancied noise ( I suppose it was his
head swelling ) ; he rose , turned up a night lamp ( he hadn &apos;t lit it ,
I &apos;ll swear ) , and went through the dining @-@ room passage and office to
investigate ( for whisky and water ) . He saw that the doors and windows
were secure , returned to bed , and fell asleep again .

&quot; There is something in a deaf person &apos;s being roused easily . I know the
case of a deaf chap who &apos;d start up at a step or movement in the house
when no one else could hear or feel it ; keen sense of vibration , I
reckon . Well , just at daybreak ( to shorten the yarn ) the banker woke
suddenly , he said , and heard a crack like a shot in the house . There was
a loose flooring @-@ board in the passage that went off like a pistol @-@ shot
sometimes when you trod on it ; and I guess Jack Drew trod on it ,
sneaking out , and he weighed nearly twelve stone . If the truth were
known , he probably heard Browne poking round , tried the window , found
the sash jammed , and was slipping through the passage to the back door .
Browne got his revolver , opened his door suddenly , and caught Drew
standing between the girl &apos;s door ( which was shut ) and the office door ,
with his coat on his arm and his boots in his hands . Browne covered him
with his revolver , swore he &apos;d shoot if he moved , and yelled for help .
Drew stood a moment like a man stunned ; then he rushed Browne , and in
the struggle the revolver went off , and Drew got hit in the arm . Two of
the mounted troopers -- who &apos;d been up looking to the horses for an early
start somewhere -- rushed in then , and took Drew . He had nothing to say .
What could he say ? He couldn &apos;t say he was a blackguard who &apos;d taken
advantage of a poor unprotected girl because she loved him . They found
the back door unlocked , by the way , which was put down to the burglar ;
of course Browne couldn &apos;t explain that he came home too muddled to lock
doors after him .

&quot; And the girl ? She shrieked and fell when the row started , and they
found her like a log on the floor of her room after it was over .

&quot; They found in Jack &apos;s overcoat pocket a parcel containing a cold chisel ,
small screw @-@ wrench , file , and one or two other things that he &apos;d bought
that evening to tinker up the old printing press . I knew that , because
I &apos;d lent him a hand a few nights before , and he told me he &apos;d have to get
the tools . They found some scratches round the key @-@ hole and knob of the
office door that I &apos;d made myself , scraping old splashes of paint off the
brass and hand @-@ plate so as to make a clean finish . Oh , it taught me the
value of circumstantial evidence ! If I was judge I wouldn &apos;t give a man
till the &apos; risin &apos; av the coort &apos; on it , any more than I would on the bare
word of the noblest woman breathing .

&quot; At the preliminary examination Jack Drew said he was guilty . But it
seemed that , according to law , he couldn &apos;t be guilty until after he was
committed . So he was committed for trial at the next Quarter Sessions .
The excitement and gabble were worse than the Dean case , or Federation ,
and sickened me , for they were all on the wrong track . You lose a lot of
life through being behind the scenes . But they cooled down presently to
wait for the trial .

&quot; They thought it best to take the girl away from the place where she &apos;d
got the shock ; so the Doctor took her to his house , where he had an old
housekeeper who was as deaf as a post -- a first class recommendation for
a housekeeper anywhere . He got a nurse from Sydney to attend on Ruth
Wilson , and no one except he and the nurse were allowed to go near
her . She lay like dead , they said , except when she had to be held down
raving ; brain fever , they said , brought on by the shock of the attempted
burglary and pistol shot . Dr. Lebinski had another doctor up from Sydney
at his own expense , but nothing could save her -- and perhaps it was as
well . She might have finished her life in a lunatic asylum . They were
going to send her to Sydney , to a brain hospital ; but she died a week
before the Sessions . She was right @-@ headed for an hour , they said , and
asking all the time for Jack . The Doctor told her he was all right and
was coming -- and , waiting and listening for him , she died .

&quot; The case was black enough against Drew now . I knew he wouldn &apos;t have the
pluck to tell the truth now , even if he was that sort of a man . I didn &apos;t
know what to do , so I spoke to the Doctor straight . I caught him coming
out of the Royal , and walked along the road with him a bit . I suppose
he thought I was going to show cause why his doors ought to have another
coat of varnish .

&quot; &apos; Hallo , Mitchell ! &apos; he said , &apos; how &apos;s painting ? &apos;

&quot; &apos; Doctor ! &apos; I said , &apos; what am I going to do about this business ? &apos;

&quot; &apos; What business ? &apos;

&quot; &apos; Jack Drew &apos;s . &apos; 

&quot; He looked at me sideways -- the swift haunted look . Then he walked on
without a word , for half a dozen yards , hands behind , and studying the
dust . Then he asked , quite quietly :

&quot; &apos; Do you know the truth ? &apos;

&quot; &apos; Yes ! &apos;

&quot; About a dozen yards this time ; then he said :

&quot; &apos; I &apos;ll see him in the morning , and see you afterwards , &apos; and he shook
hands and went on home .

&quot; Next day he came to me where I was doing a job on a step ladder . He
leaned his elbow against the steps for a moment , and rubbed his hand
over his forehead , as if it ached and he was tired .

&quot; &apos; I &apos;ve seen him , Mitchell , &apos; he said .

&quot; &apos; Yes . &apos; 

&quot; &apos; You were mates with him , once , Out Back ? &apos;

&quot; &apos; I was . &apos; 

&quot; &apos; You know Drew &apos;s hand @-@ writing ? &apos;

&quot; &apos; I should think so . &apos; 

&quot; He laid a leaf from a pocketbook on top of the steps . I read the
message written in pencil :

&quot; &apos; To Jack Mitchell . -- We were mates on the track . If you know anything of
my affair , don &apos;t give it away . -- J. D . &apos; 

&quot; I tore the leaf and dropped the bits into the paint @-@ pot .

&quot; &apos; That &apos;s all right , Doctor , &apos; I said ; &apos; but is there no way ? &apos;

&quot; &apos; None . &apos; 

&quot; He turned away , wearily . He &apos;d knocked about so much over the world
that he was past bothering about explaining things or being surprised at
anything . But he seemed to get a new idea about me ; he came back to the
steps again , and watched my brush for a while , as if he was thinking ,
in a broody sort of way , of throwing up his practice and going in for
house @-@ painting . Then he said , slowly and deliberately :

&quot; &apos; If she -- the girl -- had lived , we might have tried to fix it up quietly .
That &apos;s what I was hoping for . I don &apos;t see how we can help him now , even
if he &apos;d let us . He would never have spoken , anyway . We must let it
go on , and after the trial I &apos;ll go to Sydney and see what I can do at
headquarters . It &apos;s too late now . You understand , Mitchell ? &apos;

&quot; &apos; Yes . I &apos;ve thought it out . &apos; 

&quot; Then he went away towards the Royal .

&quot; And what could Jack Drew or we do ? Study it out whatever way you like .
There was only one possible chance to help him , and that was to go to
the judge ; and the judge that happened to be on that circuit was a man
who -- even if he did listen to the story and believe it -- would have felt
inclined to give Jack all the more for what he was charged with . Browne
was out of the question . The day before the trial I went for a long walk
in the bush , but couldn &apos;t hit on anything that the Doctor might have
missed .

&quot; I was in the court -- I couldn &apos;t keep away . The Doctor was there too .
There wasn &apos;t so much of a change in Jack as I expected , only he had the
gaol white in his face already . He stood fingering the rail , as if it
was the edge of a table on a platform and he was a tired and bored and
sleepy chairman waiting to propose a vote of thanks . &quot;

The only well @-@ known man in Australia who reminds me of Mitchell is Bland
Holt , the comedian . Mitchell was about as good hearted as Bland Holt ,
too , under it all ; but he was bigger and roughened by the bush . But he
seemed to be taking a heavy part to @-@ night , for , towards the end of his
yarn , he got up and walked up and down the length of my bed , dropping
the sentences as he turned towards me . He &apos;d folded his arms high and
tight , and his face in the moonlight was -- well , it was very different
from his careless tone of voice . He was like -- like an actor acting
tragedy and talking comedy . Mitchell went on , speaking quickly -- his
voice seeming to harden :

. . . . .

&quot; The charge was read out -- I forget how it went -- it sounded like a long
hymn being given out . Jack pleaded guilty . Then he straightened up for
the first time and looked round the court , with a calm , disinterested
look -- as if we were all strangers and he was noting the size of the
meeting . And -- it &apos;s a funny world , ain &apos;t it ? -- everyone of us shifted
or dropped his eyes , just as if we were the felons and Jack the judge .
Everyone except the Doctor ; he looked at Jack and Jack looked at him .
Then the Doctor smiled -- I can &apos;t describe it -- and Drew smiled back . It
struck me afterwards that I should have been in that smile . Then the
Doctor did what looked like a strange thing -- stood like a soldier with
his hands to Attention . I &apos;d noticed that , whenever he &apos;d made up his mind
to do a thing , he dropped his hands to his sides : it was a sign that he
couldn &apos;t be moved . Now he slowly lifted his hand to his forehead , palm
out , saluted the prisoner , turned on his heel , and marched from the
court @-@ room . &apos; He &apos;s boozin &apos; again , &apos; someone whispered . &apos; He &apos;s got a touch
of &apos; em . &apos; &apos; My oath , he &apos;s ratty ! &apos; said someone else . One of the traps
said :

&quot; &apos; Arder in the car @-@ rt ! &apos;

&quot; The judge gave it to Drew red @-@ hot on account of the burglary being the
cause of the girl &apos;s death and the sorrow in a respectable family ; then
he gave him five years &apos; hard .

&quot; It gave me a lot of confidence in myself to see the law of the land
barking up the wrong tree , while only I and the Doctor and the prisoner
knew it . But I &apos;ve found out since then that the law is often the only
one that knows it &apos;s barking up the wrong tree . &quot;

. . . . .

Mitchell prepared to turn in .

&quot; And what about Drew , &quot; I asked .

&quot; Oh , he did his time , or most of it . The Doctor went to headquarters ,
but either a drunken doctor from a geebung town wasn &apos;t of much account ,
or they weren &apos;t taking any romance just then at headquarters . So the
Doctor came back , drank heavily , and one frosty morning they found him
on his back on the bank of the creek , with his face like note @-@ paper
where the blood hadn &apos;t dried on it , and an old pistol in his hand -- that
he &apos;d used , they said , to shoot Cossacks from horseback when he was a
young dude fighting in the bush in Poland . &quot;

Mitchell lay silent a good while ; then he yawned .

&quot; Ah , well ! It &apos;s a lonely track the Lachlan &apos;s tramping to @-@ night ; but I
s &apos;pose he &apos;s got his ghosts with him . &quot;

I &apos;d been puzzling for the last half @-@ hour to think where I &apos;d met or heard
of Jack Drew ; now it flashed on me that I &apos;d been told that Jack Drew was
the Lachlan &apos;s real name .

I lay awake thinking a long time , and wished Mitchell had kept his yarn
for daytime . I felt -- well , I felt as if the Lachlan &apos;s story should have
been played in the biggest theatre in the world , by the greatest actors ,
with music for the intervals and situations -- deep , strong music , such as
thrills and lifts a man from his boot soles . And when I got to sleep I
hadn &apos;t slept a moment , it seemed to me , when I started wide awake to
see those infernal hanging boughs with a sort of nightmare idea that the
Lachlan hadn &apos;t gone , or had come back , and he and Mitchell had hanged
themselves sociably -- Mitchell for sympathy and the sake of mateship .

But Mitchell was sleeping peacefully , in spite of a path of moonlight
across his face -- and so was the pup .




The Darling River



The Darling -- which is either a muddy gutter or a second Mississippi -- is
about six times as long as the distance , in a straight line , from its
head to its mouth . The state of the river is vaguely but generally
understood to depend on some distant and foreign phenomena to which
bushmen refer in an off @-@ hand tone of voice as &quot; the Queenslan &apos; rains &quot; ,
which seem to be held responsible , in a general way , for most of the
out @-@ back trouble .

It takes less than a year to go up stream by boat to Walgett or Bourke
in a dry season ; but after the first three months the passengers
generally go ashore and walk . They get sick of being stuck in the same
sort of place , in the same old way ; they grow weary of seeing the same
old &quot; whaler &quot; drop his swag on the bank opposite whenever the boat ties
up for wood ; they get tired of lending him tobacco , and listening to his
ideas , which are limited in number and narrow in conception .

It shortens the journey to get out and walk ; but then you will have to
wait so long for your luggage -- unless you hump it with you .

We heard of a man who determined to stick to a Darling boat and travel
the whole length of the river . He was a newspaper man . He started on
his voyage of discovery one Easter in flood @-@ time , and a month later the
captain got bushed between the Darling and South Australian border . The
waters went away before he could find the river again , and left his boat
in a scrub . They had a cargo of rations , and the crew stuck to the craft
while the tucker lasted ; when it gave out they rolled up their swags and
went to look for a station , but didn &apos;t find one . The captain would study
his watch and the sun , rig up dials and make out courses , and follow
them without success . They ran short of water , and didn &apos;t smell any
for weeks ; they suffered terrible privations , and lost three of their
number , NOT including the newspaper liar . There are even dark hints
considering the drawing of lots in connection with something too
terrible to mention . They crossed a thirty @-@ mile plain at last , and
sighted a black gin . She led them to a boundary rider &apos;s hut , where they
were taken in and provided with rations and rum .

Later on a syndicate was formed to explore the country and recover the
boat ; but they found her thirty miles from the river and about eighteen
from the nearest waterhole deep enough to float her , so they left her
there . She &apos;s there still , or else the man that told us about it is the
greatest liar Out Back .

. . . . .

Imagine the hull of a North Shore ferry boat , blunted a little at the
ends and cut off about a foot below the water @-@ line , and parallel to it ,
then you will have something shaped somewhat like the hull of a Darling
mud @-@ rooter . But the river boat is much stronger . The boat we were on
was built and repaired above deck after the different ideas of many bush
carpenters , of whom the last seemed by his work to have regarded the
original plan with a contempt only equalled by his disgust at the work
of the last carpenter but one . The wheel was boxed in , mostly with round
sapling @-@ sticks fastened to the frame with bunches of nails and spikes
of all shapes and sizes , most of them bent . The general result was
decidedly picturesque in its irregularity , but dangerous to the mental
welfare of any passenger who was foolish enough to try to comprehend
the design ; for it seemed as though every carpenter had taken the
opportunity to work in a little abstract idea of his own .

The way they &quot; dock &quot; a Darling River boat is beautiful for its
simplicity . They choose a place where there are two stout trees about
the boat &apos;s length apart , and standing on a line parallel to the river .
They fix pulley @-@ blocks to the trees , lay sliding planks down into the
water , fasten a rope to one end of the steamer , and take the other end
through the block attached to the tree and thence back aboard a second
steamer ; then they carry a rope similarly from the other end through the
block on the second tree , and aboard a third boat . At a given signal
one boat leaves for Wentworth , and the other starts for the Queensland
border . The consequence is that craft number one climbs the bank
amid the cheers of the local loafers , who congregate and watch the
proceedings with great interest and approval . The crew pitch tents , and
set to work on the hull , which looks like a big , rough shallow box .

. . . . .

We once travelled on the Darling for a hundred miles or so on a boat
called the &apos; Mud Turtle &apos; -- at least , that &apos;s what WE called her . She might
reasonably have haunted the Mississippi fifty years ago . She didn &apos;t seem
particular where she went , or whether she started again or stopped
for good after getting stuck . Her machinery sounded like a chapter of
accidents and was always out of order , but she got along all the same ,
provided the steersman kept her off the bank .

Her skipper was a young man , who looked more like a drover than a
sailor , and the crew bore a greater resemblance to the unemployed than
to any other body we know of , except that they looked a little
more independent . They seemed clannish , too , with an unemployed or
free @-@ labour sort of isolation . We have an idea that they regarded our
personal appearance with contempt .

. . . . .

Above Louth we picked up a &quot; whaler &quot; , who came aboard for the sake of
society and tobacco . Not that he hoped to shorten his journey ; he had no
destination . He told us many reckless and unprincipled lies , and gave
us a few ornamental facts . One of them took our fancy , and impressed
us -- with its beautiful simplicity , I suppose . He said : &quot; Some miles
above where the Darlin &apos; and the Warrygo runs inter each other , there &apos;s a
billygong runnin &apos; right across between the two rivers and makin &apos; a sort
of tryhangular hyland ; &apos; n &apos; I can tel &apos;yer a funny thing about it . &quot; Here
he paused to light his pipe . &quot; Now , &quot; he continued , impressively , jerking
the match overboard , &quot; when the Darlin &apos;s up , and the Warrygo &apos;s LOW ,
the billygong runs from the Darlin &apos; into the WARRYGO ; AND , when the
Warrygo &apos;s up &apos; n &apos; the Darlin &apos;s down , the waters runs FROM the Warrygo &apos; n&apos;
inter the Darlin &apos; . &quot;

What could be more simple ?

The steamer was engaged to go up a billabong for a load of shearers from
a shed which was cutting out ; and first it was necessary to tie up in
the river and discharge the greater portion of the cargo in order that
the boat might safely negotiate the shallow waters . A local fisherman ,
who volunteered to act as pilot , was taken aboard , and after he was
outside about a pint of whisky he seemed to have the greatest confidence
in his ability to take us to hell , or anywhere else -- at least , he said
so . A man was sent ashore with blankets and tucker to mind the wool , and
we crossed the river , butted into the anabranch , and started out back .
Only the Lord and the pilot know how we got there . We travelled over the
bush , through its branches sometimes , and sometimes through grass and
mud , and every now and then we struck something that felt and sounded
like a collision . The boat slid down one hill , and &quot; fetched &quot; a stump at
the bottom with a force that made every mother &apos;s son bite his tongue or
break a tooth .

The shearers came aboard next morning , with their swags and two
cartloads of boiled mutton , bread , &quot; brownie &quot; , and tea and sugar . They
numbered about fifty , including the rouseabouts . This load of sin sank
the steamer deeper into the mud ; but the passengers crowded over to
port , by request of the captain , and the crew poked the bank away with
long poles . When we began to move the shearers gave a howl like the
yell of a legion of lost souls escaping from down below . They gave three
cheers for the rouseabouts &apos; cook , who stayed behind ; then they cursed
the station with a mighty curse . They cleared a space on deck , had
a jig , and afterwards a fight between the shearers &apos; cook and his
assistant . They gave a mighty bush whoop for the Darling when the boat
swung into that grand old gutter , and in the evening they had a general
all @-@ round time . We got back , and the crew had to reload the wool without
assistance , for it bore the accursed brand of a &quot; freedom @-@ of @-@ contract &quot;
shed .

We slept , or tried to sleep , that night on the ridge of two wool bales
laid with the narrow sides up , having first been obliged to get ashore
and fight six rounds with a shearer for the privilege of roosting there .
The live cinders from the firebox went up the chimney all night , and
fell in showers on deck . Every now and again a spark would burn through
the &quot; Wagga rug &quot; of a sleeping shearer , and he &apos;d wake suddenly and get up
and curse . It was no use shifting round , for the wind was all ways ,
and the boat steered north , south , east , and west to humour the river .
Occasionally a low branch would root three or four passengers off their
wool bales , and they &apos;d get up and curse in chorus . The boat started two
snags ; and towards daylight struck a stump . The accent was on the stump .
A wool bale went overboard , and took a swag and a dog with it ; then the
owner of the swag and dog and the crew of the boat had a swearing match
between them . The swagman won .

About daylight we stretched our cramped limbs , extricated one leg from
between the wool bales , and found that the steamer was just crayfishing
away from a mud island , where she had tied up for more wool . Some of the
chaps had been ashore and boiled four or five buckets of tea and coffee .
Shortly after the boat had settled down to work again an incident came
along . A rouseabout rose late , and , while the others were at breakfast ,
got an idea into his head that a good &quot; sloosh &quot; would freshen him up ; so
he mooched round until he found a big wooden bucket with a rope to it .
He carried the bucket aft of the wheel . The boat was butting up stream
for all she was worth , and the stream was running the other way , of
course , and about a hundred times as fast as a train . The jackeroo gave
the line a turn round his wrist ; before anyone could see him in time to
suppress him , he lifted the bucket , swung it to and fro , and dropped it
cleverly into the water .

This delayed us for nearly an hour . A couple of men jumped into the row
boat immediately and cast her adrift . They picked up the jackeroo about
a mile down the river , clinging to a snag , and when we hauled him aboard
he looked like something the cat had dragged in , only bigger . We revived
him with rum and got him on his feet ; and then , when the captain and
crew had done cursing him , he rubbed his head , went forward , and had a
look at the paddle ; then he rubbed his head again , thought , and remarked
to his mates :

&quot; Wasn &apos;t it lucky I didn &apos;t dip that bucket FOR &apos;ARD the wheel ? &quot;

This remark struck us forcibly . We agreed that it was lucky -- for him ;
but the captain remarked that it was damned unlucky for the world ,
which , he explained , was over @-@ populated with fools already .

Getting on towards afternoon we found a barge loaded with wool and tied
up to a tree in the wilderness . There was no sign of a man to be seen ,
nor any sign , except the barge , that a human being had ever been there .
The captain took the craft in tow , towed it about ten miles up the
stream , and left it in a less likely place than where it was before .

Floating bottles began to be more frequent , and we knew by that same
token that we were nearing &quot; Here &apos;s Luck ! &quot; -- Bourke , we mean . And this
reminds us .

When the Brewarrina people observe a more than ordinary number of
bottles floating down the river , they guess that Walgett is on the
spree ; when the Louth chaps see an unbroken procession of dead marines
for three or four days they know that Bourke &apos;s drunk . The poor ,
God @-@ abandoned &quot; whaler &quot; sits in his hungry camp at sunset and watches the
empty symbols of Hope go by , and feels more God @-@ forgotten than ever -- and
thirstier , if possible -- and gets a great , wide , thirsty , quaking , empty
longing to be up where those bottles come from . If the townspeople knew
how much misery they caused by their thoughtlessness they would drown
their dead marines , or bury them , but on no account allow them to go
drifting down the river , and stirring up hells in the bosoms of less
fortunate fellow @-@ creatures .

There came a man from Adelaide to Bourke once , and he collected all the
empty bottles in town , stacked them by the river , and waited for a boat .
What he wanted them for the legend sayeth not , but the people reckoned
he had a &quot; private still &quot; , or something of that sort , somewhere down the
river , and were satisfied . What he came from Adelaide for , or whether he
really did come from there , we do not know . All the Darling bunyips are
supposed to come from Adelaide . Anyway , the man collected all the empty
bottles he could lay his hands on , and piled them on the bank , where
they made a good show . He waited for a boat to take his cargo , and ,
while waiting , he got drunk . That excited no comment . He stayed drunk
for three weeks , but the townspeople saw nothing unusual in that . In
order to become an object of interest in their eyes , and in that line ,
he would have had to stay drunk for a year and fight three times a
day -- oftener , if possible -- and lie in the road in the broiling
heat between whiles , and be walked on by camels and Afghans and
free @-@ labourers , and be locked up every time he got sober enough to smash
a policeman , and try to hang himself naked , and be finally squashed by a
loaded wool team .

But while he drank the Darling rose , for reasons best known to itself ,
and floated those bottles off . They strung out and started for the
Antarctic Ocean , with a big old wicker @-@ worked demijohn in the lead .

For the first week the down @-@ river men took no notice ; but after the
bottles had been drifting past with scarcely a break for a fortnight or
so , they began to get interested . Several whalers watched the procession
until they got the jimjams by force of imagination , and when their
bodies began to float down with the bottles , the down @-@ river people got
anxious .

At last the Mayor of Wilcannia wired Bourke to know whether Dibbs or
Parkes was dead , or democracy triumphant , or if not , wherefore the
jubilation ? Many telegrams of a like nature were received during that
week , and the true explanation was sent in reply to each . But it wasn &apos;t
believed , and to this day Bourke has the name of being the most drunken
town on the river .

After dinner a humorous old hard case mysteriously took us aside and
said he had a good yarn which we might be able to work up . We asked him
how , but he winked a mighty cunning wink and said that he knew all about
us . Then he asked us to listen . He said :

&quot; There was an old feller down the Murrumbidgee named Kelly . He was a
bit gone here . One day Kelly was out lookin &apos; for some sheep , when he
got lost . It was gettin &apos; dark . Bymeby there came an old crow in a tree
overhead .

&quot; &apos; Kel @-@ ley , you &apos;re lo @-@ o @-@ st ! Kel @-@ ley , you &apos;re lo @-@ o @-@ st ! &apos; sez the crow .

&quot; &apos; I know I am , &apos; sez Kelly .

&quot; &apos; Fol @-@ ler me , fol @-@ ler me , &apos; sez the crow .

&quot; &apos; Right y &apos;are , &apos; sez Kelly , with a jerk of his arm . &apos; Go ahead . &apos; 

&quot; So the crow went on , and Kelly follered , an &apos; bymeby he found he was on
the right track .

&quot; Sometime after Kelly was washin &apos; sheep ( this was when we useter wash
the sheep instead of the wool ) . Kelly was standin &apos; on the platform with
a crutch in his hand landin &apos; the sheep , when there came a old crow in
the tree overhead .

&quot; &apos; Kelly , I &apos;m hun @-@ gry ! Kel @-@ ley , I &apos;m hun @-@ ger @-@ ry ! &apos; sez the crow .

&quot; &apos; Alright , &apos; sez Kelly ; &apos; be up at the hut about dinner time &apos; n &apos; I &apos;ll
sling you out something . &apos; 

&quot; &apos; Drown -- a -- sheep ! Drown -- a -- sheep , Kel @-@ ley , &apos; sez the crow .

&quot; &apos; Blanked if I do , &apos; sez Kelly . &apos; If I drown a sheep I &apos;ll have to pay for
it , be @-@ God ! &apos;

&quot; &apos; Then I won &apos;t find yer when yer lost agin , &apos; sez the crow .

&quot; &apos; I &apos;m damned if yer will , &apos; says Kelly . &apos; I &apos;ll take blanky good care I
won &apos;t get lost again , to be found by a gory ole crow . &apos; &quot;

. . . . .

There are a good many fishermen on the Darling . They camp along the
banks in all sorts of tents , and move about in little box boats that
will only float one man . The fisherman is never heavy . He is mostly a
withered little old madman , with black claws , dirty rags ( which he never
changes ) , unkempt hair and beard , and a &quot; ratty &quot; expression . We cannot
say that we ever saw him catch a fish , or even get a bite , and we
certainly never saw him offer any for sale .

He gets a dozen or so lines out into the stream , with the shore end
fastened to pegs or roots on the bank , and passed over sticks about four
feet high , stuck in the mud ; on the top of these sticks he hangs bullock
bells , or substitutes -- jam tins with stones fastened inside to bits of
string . Then he sits down and waits . If the cod pulls the line the bell
rings .

The fisherman is a great authority on the river and fish , but has
usually forgotten everything else , including his name . He chops firewood
for the boats sometimes , but it isn &apos;t his profession -- he &apos;s a fisherman .
He is only sane on points concerning the river , though he has all the
fisherman &apos;s eccentricities . Of course he is a liar .

When he gets his camp fixed on one bank it strikes him he ought to be
over on the other , or at a place up round the bend , so he shifts . Then
he reckons he was a fool for not stopping where he was before . He
never dies . He never gets older , or drier , or more withered looking ,
or dirtier , or loonier -- because he can &apos;t . We cannot imagine him as ever
having been a boy , or even a youth . We cannot even try to imagine him
as a baby . He is an animated mummy , who used to fish on the Nile three
thousand years ago , and catch nothing .

. . . . .

We forgot to mention that there are wonderfully few wrecks on the
Darling . The river boats seldom go down -- their hulls are not built that
way -- and if one did go down it wouldn &apos;t sink far . But , once down , a boat
is scarcely ever raised again ; because , you see , the mud silts up round
it and over it , and glues it , as it were , to the bottom of the river .
Then the forty @-@ foot alligators -- which come down with the &quot; Queenslan&apos;
rains &quot; , we suppose -- root in the mud and fill their bellies with sodden
flour and drowned deck @-@ hands .

They tried once to blow up a wreck with dynamite because it ( the
wreck ) obstructed navigation ; but they blew the bottom out of the river
instead , and all the water went through . The Government have been boring
for it ever since . I saw some of the bores myself -- there is one at
Coonamble .

There is a yarn along the Darling about a cute Yankee who was invited
up to Bourke to report on a proposed scheme for locking the river . He
arrived towards the end of a long and severe drought , and was met at the
railway station by a deputation of representative bushmen , who invited
him , in the first place , to accompany them to the principal pub -- which
he did . He had been observed to study the scenery a good deal while
coming up in the train , but kept his conclusions to himself . On the way
to the pub he had a look at the town , and it was noticed that he tilted
his hat forward very often , and scratched the back of his head a
good deal , and pondered a lot ; but he refrained from expressing an
opinion -- even when invited to do so . He guessed that his opinions
wouldn &apos;t do much good , anyway , and he calculated that they would keep
till he got back &quot; over our way &quot; -- by which it was reckoned he meant the
States .

When they asked him what he &apos;d have , he said to Watty the publican :

&quot; Wal , I reckon you can build me your national drink . I guess I &apos;ll try
it . &quot;

A long colonial was drawn for him , and he tried it . He seemed rather
startled at first , then he looked curiously at the half @-@ empty glass ,
set it down very softly on the bar , and leaned against the same and
fell into a reverie ; from which he roused himself after a while , with a
sorrowful jerk of his head .

&quot; Ah , well , &quot; he said . &quot; Show me this river of yourn . &quot;

They led him to the Darling , and he had a look at it .

&quot; Is this your river ? &quot; he asked .

&quot; Yes , &quot; they replied , apprehensively .

He tilted his hat forward till the brim nearly touched his nose ,
scratched the back of his long neck , shut one eye , and looked at the
river with the other . Then , after spitting half a pint of tobacco juice
into the stream , he turned sadly on his heel and led the way back to the
pub . He invited the boys to &quot; pisen themselves &quot; ; after they were served
he ordered out the longest tumbler on the premises , poured a drop into
it from nearly every bottle on the shelf , added a lump of ice , and drank
slowly and steadily .

Then he took pity on the impatient and anxious population , opened his
mouth , and spake .

&quot; Look here , fellows , &quot; he drawled , jerking his arm in the direction of
the river , &quot; I &apos;ll tell you what I &apos;ll dew . I &apos;ll bottle that damned river
of yourn in twenty @-@ four hours ! &quot;

Later on he mellowed a bit , under the influence of several drinks which
were carefully and conscientiously &quot; built &quot; from plans and specifications
supplied by himself , and then , among other things , he said :

&quot; If that there river rises as high as you say it dew -- and if this was
the States -- why , we &apos;d have had the Great Eastern up here twenty years
ago &quot; -- -- or words to that effect .

Then he added , reflectively :

&quot; When I come over here I calculated that I was going to make things
hum , but now I guess I &apos;ll have to change my prospectus . There &apos;s a lot of
loose energy laying round over our way , but I guess that if I wanted
to make things move in your country I &apos;d have to bring over the entire
American nation -- also his wife and dawg . You &apos;ve got the makings of a
glorious nation over here , but you don &apos;t get up early enough ! &quot;

. . . . .

The only national work performed by the blacks is on the Darling . They
threw a dam of rocks across the river -- near Brewarrina , we think -- to
make a fish trap . It &apos;s there yet . But God only knows where they got the
stones from , or how they carried them , for there isn &apos;t a pebble within
forty miles .




A Case for the Oracle



The Oracle and I were camped together . The Oracle was a bricklayer by
trade , and had two or three small contracts on hand . I was &quot; doing a
bit of house @-@ painting &quot; . There were a plasterer , a carpenter , and a
plumber -- we were all T &apos;othersiders , and old mates , and we worked
things together . It was in Westralia -- the Land of T &apos;othersiders -- and ,
therefore , we were not surprised when Mitchell turned up early one
morning , with his swag and an atmosphere of salt water about him .

He &apos;d had a rough trip , he said , and would take a spell that day and take
the lay of the land and have something cooked for us by the time we came
home ; and go to graft himself next morning . And next morning he went to
work , &quot; labouring &quot; for the Oracle .

The Oracle and his mates , being small contractors and not pressed for
time , had dispensed with the services of a labourer , and had done their
own mixing and hod @-@ carrying in turns . They didn &apos;t want a labourer now ,
but the Oracle was a vague fatalist , and Mitchell a decided one . So it
passed .

The Oracle had a &quot; Case &quot; right under his nose -- in his own employ , in
fact ; but was not aware of the fact until Mitchell drew his attention
to it . The Case went by the name of Alfred O &apos;Briar -- which hinted a mixed
parentage . He was a small , nervous working @-@ man , of no particular colour ,
and no decided character , apparently . If he had a soul above bricks , he
never betrayed it . He was not popular on the jobs . There was something
sly about Alf , they said .

The Oracle had taken him on in the first place as a day @-@ labourer ,
but afterwards shared the pay with him as with Mitchell . O &apos;Briar
shouted -- judiciously , but on every possible occasion -- for the Oracle ;
and , as he was an indifferent workman , the boys said he only did this so
that the Oracle might keep him on . If O &apos;Briar took things easy and did
no more than the rest of us , at least one of us would be sure to get it
into his head that he was loafing on us ; and if he grafted harder than
we did , we &apos;d be sure to feel indignant about that too , and reckon that
it was done out of nastiness or crawlsomeness , and feel a contempt for
him accordingly . We found out accidentally that O &apos;Briar was an excellent
mimic and a bit of a ventriloquist , but he never entertained us with his
peculiar gifts ; and we set that down to churlishness .

O &apos;Briar kept his own counsel , and his history , if he had one ; and hid
his hopes , joys , and sorrows , if he had any , behind a vacant grin ,
as Mitchell hid his behind a quizzical one . He never resented alleged
satire -- perhaps he couldn &apos;t see it -- and therefore he got the name of
being a cur . As a rule , he was careful with his money , and was called
mean -- not , however , by the Oracle , whose philosophy was simple , and
whose sympathy could not realise a limit ; nor yet by Mitchell . Mitchell
waited .

. . . . .

O &apos;Briar occupied a small tent by himself , and lived privately of
evenings . When we began to hear two men talking at night in his tent ,
we were rather surprised , and wondered in a vague kind of way how any of
the chaps could take sufficient interest in Alf to go in and yarn with
him . In the days when he was supposed to be sociable , we had voted him a
bore ; even the Oracle was moved to admit that he was &quot; a bit slow &quot; .

But late one night we distinctly heard a woman &apos;s voice in O &apos;Briar &apos;s
tent . The Oracle suddenly became hard of hearing , and , though we heard
the voice on several occasions , he remained exasperatingly deaf , yet
aggressively unconscious of the fact . &quot; I have got enough to do puzzling
over me own whys and wherefores , &quot; he said . Mitchell began to take some
interest in O &apos;Briar , and treated him with greater respect . But our camp
had the name of being the best @-@ constructed , the cleanest , and the most
respectable in the vicinity . The health officer and constable in charge
had complimented us on the fact , and we were proud of it . And there were
three young married couples in camp , also a Darby and Joan ; therefore ,
when the voice of a woman began to be heard frequently and at
disreputable hours of the night in O &apos;Briar &apos;s tent , we got uneasy about
it . And when the constable who was on night duty gave us a friendly
hint , Mitchell and I agreed that something must be done .

&quot; Av coorse , men will be men , &quot; said the constable , as he turned his
horse &apos;s head , &quot; but I thought I &apos;d mention it . O &apos;Briar is a dacent man ,
and he &apos;s one of yer mates . Av coorse . There &apos;s a bad lot in that camp in
the scrub over yander , and -- av coorse . Good @-@ day to ye , byes . &quot;

. . . . .

Next night we heard the voice in O &apos;Briar &apos;s tent again , and decided to
speak to Alf in a friendly way about it in the morning . We listened
outside in the dark , but could not distinguish the words , though I
thought I recognised the voice .

&quot; It &apos;s the hussy from the camp over there ; she &apos;s got holt of that fool ,
and she &apos;ll clean him out before she &apos;s done , &quot; I said . &quot; We &apos;re Alf &apos;s mates ,
any way it goes , and we ought to put a stop to it . &quot;

&quot; What hussy ? &quot; asked Mitchell ; &quot; there &apos;s three or four there . &quot;

&quot; The one with her hair all over her head , &quot; I answered .

&quot; Where else should it be ? &quot; asked Mitchell . &quot; But I &apos;ll just have a peep
and see who it is . There &apos;s no harm in that . &quot;

He crept up to the tent and cautiously moved the flap . Alf &apos;s candle was
alight ; he lay on his back in his bunk with his arms under his head ,
calmly smoking . We withdrew .

&quot; They must have heard us , &quot; said Mitchell ; &quot; and she &apos;s slipped out under
the tent at the back , and through the fence into the scrub . &quot;

Mitchell &apos;s respect for Alf increased visibly .

But we began to hear ominous whispers from the young married couples ,
and next Saturday night , which was pay @-@ night , we decided to see it
through . We did not care to speak to Alf until we were sure . He stayed
in camp , as he often did , on Saturday evening , while the others went
up town . Mitchell and I returned earlier than usual , and leaned on the
fence at the back of Alf &apos;s tent .

We were scarcely there when we were startled by a &quot; rat @-@ tat @-@ tat &quot; as of
someone knocking at a door . Then an old woman &apos;s voice INSIDE the tent
asked : &quot; Who &apos;s there ? &quot;

&quot; It &apos;s me , &quot; said Alf &apos;s voice from the front , &quot; Mr. O &apos;Briar from Perth . &quot;

&quot; Mary , go and open the door ! &quot; said the old woman . ( Mitchell nudged me to
keep quiet . )

&quot; Come in , Mr. O &apos;Breer , &quot; said the old woman . &quot; Come in . How do you do ?
When did you get back ? &quot;

&quot; Only last night , &quot; said Alf .

&quot; Look at that now ! Bless us all ! And how did you like the country at
all ? &quot;

&quot; I didn &apos;t care much for it , &quot; said Alf . We lost the thread of it until
the old woman spoke again .

&quot; Have you had your tea , Mr. O &apos;Breer ? &quot;

&quot; Yes , thank you , Mrs. O &apos;Connor . &quot;

&quot; Are you quite sure , man ? &quot;

&quot; Quite sure , thank you , Mrs. O &apos;Connor . &quot; ( Mitchell trod on my foot . )

&quot; Will you have a drop of whisky or a glass of beer , Mr. O &apos;Breer ? &quot;

&quot; I &apos;ll take a glass of beer , thank you , Mrs. O &apos;Connor . &quot;

There seemed to be a long pause . Then the old woman said , &quot; Ah , well , I
must get my work done , and Mary will stop here and keep you company , Mr.
O &apos;Breer . &quot; The arrangement seemed satisfactory to all parties , for there
was nothing more said for a while . ( Mitchell nudged me again , with
emphasis , and I kicked his shin . )

Presently Alf said : &quot; Mary ! &quot; And a girl &apos;s voice said , &quot; Yes , Alf . &quot;

&quot; You remember the night I went away , Mary ? &quot;

&quot; Yes , Alf , I do . &quot;

&quot; I have travelled long ways since then , Mary ; I worked hard and lived
close . I didn &apos;t make my fortune , but I managed to rub a note or two
together . It was a hard time and a lonesome time for me , Mary . The
summer &apos;s awful over there , and livin &apos;s bad and dear . You couldn &apos;t have
any idea of it , Mary . &quot;

&quot; No , Alf . &quot;

&quot; I didn &apos;t come back so well off as I expected . &quot;

&quot; But that doesn &apos;t matter , Alf . &quot;

&quot; I got heart @-@ sick and tired of it , and couldn &apos;t stand it any longer ,
Mary . &quot;

&quot; But that &apos;s all over now , Alf ; you mustn &apos;t think of it . &quot;

&quot; Your mother wrote to me . &quot;

&quot; I know she did &quot; -- ( very low and gently ) .

&quot; And do you know what she put in it , Mary ? &quot;

&quot; Yes , Alf . &quot;

&quot; And did you ask her to put it in ? &quot;

&quot; Don &apos;t ask me , Alf . &quot;

&quot; And it &apos;s all true , Mary ? &quot;

There was no answer , but the silence seemed satisfactory .

&quot; And be sure you have yourself down here on Sunday , Alf , me son . &quot;
( &quot; There &apos;s the old woman come back ! &quot; said Mitchell . )

&quot; An &apos; since the girl &apos;s willin &apos; to have ye , and the ould woman &apos;s
willin &apos; -- there &apos;s me hand on it , Alf , me boy . An &apos; God bless ye both . &quot;
( &quot; The old man &apos;s come now , &quot; said Mitchell . )

. . . . .

&quot; Come along , &quot; said Mitchell , leading the way to the front of the tent .

&quot; But I wouldn &apos;t like to intrude on them . It &apos;s hardly right , Mitchell , is
it ? &quot;

&quot; That &apos;s all right , &quot; said Mitchell . He tapped the tent pole .

&quot; Come in , &quot; said Alf . Alf was lying on his bunk as before , with his arms
under his head . His face wore a cheerful , not to say happy , expression .
There was no one else in the tent . I was never more surprised in my
life .

&quot; Have you got the paper , Alf ? &quot; said Mitchell .

&quot; Yes . You &apos;ll find it there at the foot of the bunk . There it is . Won &apos;t
you sit down , Mitchell ? &quot;

&quot; Not to @-@ night , &quot; said Mitchell . &quot; We brought you a bottle of ale . We &apos;re
just going to turn in . &quot;

And we said &quot; good @-@ night &quot; . &quot; Well , &quot; I said to Mitchell when we got inside ,
&quot; what do you think of it ? &quot;

&quot; I don &apos;t think of it at all , &quot; said Mitchell . &quot; Do you mean to say you
can &apos;t see it now ? &quot;

&quot; No , I &apos;m dashed if I can , &quot; I said . &quot; Some of us must be drunk , I think ,
or getting rats . It &apos;s not to be wondered at , and the sooner we get out
of this country the better . &quot;

&quot; Well , you must be a fool , Joe , &quot; said Mitchell . &quot; Can &apos;t you see ? ALF
THINKS ALOUD . &quot;

&quot; WHAT ? &quot;

&quot; Talks to himself . He was thinking about going back to his sweetheart .
Don &apos;t you know he &apos;s a bit of a ventriloquist ? &quot;

Mitchell lay awake a long time , in the position that Alf usually lay in ,
and thought . Perhaps he thought on the same lines as Alf did that night .
But Mitchell did his thinking in silence .

We thought it best to tell the Oracle quietly . He was deeply interested ,
but not surprised . &quot; I &apos;ve heerd of such cases before , &quot; he said . But the
Oracle was a gentleman . &quot; There &apos;s things that a man wants to keep to
himself that ain &apos;t his business , &quot; he said . And we understood this remark
to be intended for our benefit , and to indicate a course of action upon
which the Oracle had decided , with respect to this case , and which we ,
in his opinion , should do well to follow .

Alf got away a week or so later , and we all took a holiday and went down
to Fremantle to see him off . Perhaps he wondered why Mitchell gripped
his hand so hard and wished him luck so earnestly , and was surprised
when he gave him three cheers .

&quot; Ah , well ! &quot; remarked Mitchell , as we turned up the wharf .

&quot; I &apos;ve heerd of such cases before , &quot; said the Oracle , meditatively . &quot; They
ain &apos;t common , but I &apos;ve hear &apos;d of such cases before . &quot;




A Daughter of Maoriland

A sketch of poor @-@ class Maoris



The new native @-@ school teacher , who was &quot; green &quot; , &quot; soft &quot; , and poetical ,
and had a literary ambition , called her &quot; August &quot; , and fondly hoped to
build a romance on her character . She was down in the school registers
as Sarah Moses , Maori , 16 years and three months . She looked twenty ; but
this was nothing , insomuch as the mother of the youngest child in the
school -- a dear little half @-@ caste lady of two or three summers -- had not
herself the vaguest idea of the child &apos;s age , nor anybody else &apos;s , nor
of ages in the abstract . The church register was lost some six years
before , when &quot; Granny &quot; , who was a hundred , if a day , was supposed to
be about twenty @-@ five . The teacher had to guess the ages of all the new
pupils .

August was apparently the oldest in the school -- a big , ungainly , awkward
girl , with a heavy negro type of Maori countenance , and about as much
animation , mentally or physically , as a cow . She was given to brooding ;
in fact , she brooded all the time . She brooded all day over her school
work , but did it fairly well . How the previous teachers had taught her
all she knew was a mystery to the new one . There had been a tragedy in
August &apos;s family when she was a child , and the affair seemed to have cast
a gloom over the lives of the entire family , for the lowering brooding
cloud was on all their faces . August would take to the bush when things
went wrong at home , and climb a tree and brood till she was found and
coaxed home . Things , according to pa gossip , had gone wrong with her
from the date of the tragedy , when she , a bright little girl , was
taken -- a homeless orphan -- to live with a sister , and , afterwards , with
an aunt @-@ by @-@ marriage . They treated her , &apos; twas said , with a brutality
which must have been greatly exaggerated by pa @-@ gossip , seeing
that unkindness of this description is , according to all the best
authorities , altogether foreign to Maori nature .

Pa @-@ gossip -- which is less reliable than the ordinary washerwoman kind ,
because of a deeper and more vicious ignorance -- had it that one time
when August was punished by a teacher ( or beaten by her sister or
aunt @-@ by @-@ marriage ) she &quot; took to the bush &quot; for three days , at the
expiration of which time she was found on the ground in an exhausted
condition . She was evidently a true Maori or savage , and this was one of
the reasons why the teacher with the literary ambition took an interest
in her . She had a print of a portrait of a man in soldier &apos;s uniform ,
taken from a copy of the &apos; Illustrated London News &apos; , pasted over the
fireplace in the whare where she lived , and neatly bordered by vandyked
strips of silvered tea @-@ paper . She had pasted it in the place of honour ,
or as near as she could get to it . The place of honour was sacred
to framed representations of the Nativity and Catholic subjects ,
half @-@ modelled , half @-@ pictured . The print was a portrait of the last Czar
of Russia , of all the men in the world ; and August was reported to have
said that she loved that man . His father had been murdered , so had her
mother . This was one of the reasons why the teacher with the literary
ambition thought he could get a romance out of her .

After the first week she hung round the new schoolmistress ,
dog @-@ like -- with &quot; dog @-@ like affection &quot; , thought the teacher . She came down
often during the holidays , and hung about the verandah and back door for
an hour or so ; then , by @-@ and @-@ bye , she &apos;d be gone . Her brooding seemed
less aggressive on such occasions . The teacher reckoned that she had
something on her mind , and wanted to open her heart to &quot; the wife &quot; , but
was too ignorant or too shy , poor girl ; and he reckoned , from his theory
of Maori character , that it might take her weeks , or months , to come to
the point . One day , after a great deal of encouragement , she explained
that she felt &quot; so awfully lonely , Mrs. Lorrens . &quot; All the other girls
were away , and she wished it was school @-@ time .

She was happy and cheerful again , in her brooding way , in the
playground . There was something sadly ludicrous about her great ,
ungainly figure slopping round above the children at play . The
schoolmistress took her into the parlour , gave her tea and cake , and was
kind to her ; and she took it all with broody cheerfulness .

One Sunday morning she came down to the cottage and sat on the edge of
the verandah , looking as wretchedly miserable as a girl could . She was
in rags -- at least , she had a rag of a dress on -- and was barefooted and
bareheaded . She said that her aunt had turned her out , and she was going
to walk down the coast to Whale Bay to her grandmother -- a long day &apos;s
ride . The teacher was troubled , because he was undecided what to do .
He had to be careful to avoid any unpleasantness arising out of Maori
cliquism . As the teacher he couldn &apos;t let her go in the state she was in ;
from the depths of his greenness he trusted her , from the depths of
his softness he pitied her ; his poetic nature was fiercely indignant on
account of the poor girl &apos;s wrongs , and the wife spoke for her . Then he
thought of his unwritten romance , and regarded August in the light of
copy , and that settled it . While he talked the matter over with his
wife , August &quot; hid in the dark of her hair , &quot; awaiting her doom . The
teacher put his hat on , walked up to the pa , and saw her aunt . She
denied that she had turned August out , but the teacher believed
the girl . He explained his position , in words simplified for Maori
comprehension , and the aunt and relations said they understood , and that
he was &quot; perfectly right , Mr. Lorrens . &quot; They were very respectful . The
teacher said that if August would not return home , he was willing to let
her stay at the cottage until such time as her uncle , who was absent ,
returned , and he ( the teacher ) could talk the matter over with him . The
relations thought that that was the very best thing that could be done ,
and thanked him . The aunt , two sisters , and as many of the others ,
including the children , as were within sight or hail at the time -- most
of them could not by any possible means have had the slightest
connection with the business in hand -- accompanied the teacher to the
cottage . August took to the flax directly she caught sight of her
relations , and was with difficulty induced to return . There was a lot
of talk in Maori , during which the girl and her aunt shuffled and swung
round at the back of each other , and each talked over her shoulder , and
laughed foolishly and awkwardly once or twice ; but in the end the girl
was sullenly determined not to return home , so it was decided that she
should stay . The schoolmistress made tea .

August brightened from the first day . She was a different girl
altogether . &quot; I never saw such a change in a girl , &quot; said the young
schoolmistress , and one or two others . &quot; I always thought she was a
good girl if taken the right way ; all she wanted was a change and kind
treatment . &quot; But the stolid old Maori chairman of the school committee
only shrugged his shoulders and said ( when the schoolmistress ,
woman @-@ like , pressed him for an opinion to agree with her own ) , &quot; You can
look at it two ways , Mrs. Lorrens . &quot; Which , by the way , was about the
only expression of opinion that the teacher was ever able to get out of
him on any subject .

August worked and behaved well . She was wonderfully quick in picking up
English ways and housework . True , she was awkward and not over cleanly
in some things , but her mistress had patience with her . Who wouldn &apos;t
have ? She &quot; couldn &apos;t do enough &quot; for her benefactress ; she hung on her
words and sat at her footstool of evenings in a way that gladdened the
teacher &apos;s sentimental nature ; she couldn &apos;t bear to see him help his wife
with a hat @-@ pin or button -- August must do it . She insisted on doing her
mistress &apos; hair every night . In short , she tried in every way to show her
gratitude . The teacher and his wife smiled brightly at each other behind
her back , and thought how cheerful the house was since she came , and
wondered what they &apos;d do without her . It was a settled thing that they
should take her back to the city with them , and have a faithful and
grateful retainer all their lives and a sort of Aunt Chloe for their
children , when they had any . The teacher got yards of copy out of her
for his &quot; Maori Sketches and Characters &quot; , worked joyously at his romance ,
and felt great already , and was happy . She had a bed made up temporarily
( until the teacher could get a spring mattress for her from town ) on the
floor in the dining @-@ room , and when she &apos;d made her bed she &apos;d squat on it
in front of the fire and sing Maori songs in a soft voice . She &apos;d sing
the teacher and his wife , in the next room , to sleep . Then she &apos;d get up
and have a feed , but they never heard her .

Her manners at the table ( for she was treated &quot; like one of themselves &quot;
in the broadest sense of the term ) were surprisingly good , considering
that the adults of her people were decidedly cow @-@ like in white society ,
and scoffed sea @-@ eggs , shell @-@ fish , and mutton @-@ birds at home with a gallop
which was not edifying . Her appetite , it was true , was painful at times
to the poetic side of the teacher &apos;s nature ; but he supposed that she &apos;d
been half @-@ starved at home , poor girl , and would get over it . Anyway , the
copy he &apos;d get out of her would repay him for this and other expenses a
hundredfold . Moreover , begging and borrowing had ceased with her advent ,
and the teacher set this down to her influence .

The first jar came when she was sent on horseback to the town for
groceries , and didn &apos;t get back till late the next day . She explained
that some of her relations got hold of her and made her stay , and wanted
her to go into public @-@ houses with them , but she wouldn &apos;t . She said that
SHE wanted to come home . But why didn &apos;t she ? The teacher let it pass ,
and hoped she &apos;d gain strength of character by @-@ and @-@ bye . He had waited up
late the night before with her supper on the hob ; and he and his wife
had been anxious for fear something had happened to the poor girl
who was under their care . He had walked to the treacherous river @-@ ford
several times during the evening , and waited there for her . So perhaps
he was tired , and that was why he didn &apos;t write next night .

The sugar @-@ bag , the onion @-@ basket , the potato @-@ bag and the tea @-@ chest began
to &quot; go down &quot; alarmingly , and an occasional pound of candles , a pigeon ,
a mutton @-@ bird ( plucked and ready for Sunday &apos;s cooking ) , and other little
trifles went , also . August couldn &apos;t understand it , and the teacher
believed her , for falsehood and deceit are foreign to the simple natures
of the modern Maoris . There were no cats ; but no score of ordinary cats
could have given colour to the cat theory , had it been raised in this
case . The breath of August advertised onions more than once , but no
human stomach could have accounted for the quantity . She surely could
not have eaten the other things raw -- and she had no opportunities for
private cooking , as far as the teacher and his wife could see . The other
Maoris were out of the question ; they were all strictly honest .

Thefts and annoyances of the above description were credited to the
&quot; swaggies &quot; who infested the roads , and had a very bad name down that
way ; so the teacher loaded his gun , and told August to rouse him at
once , if she heard a sound in the night . She said she would ; but a
heavy @-@ weight &quot; swaggie &quot; could have come in and sat on her and had a smoke
without waking her .

She couldn &apos;t be trusted to go a message . She &apos;d take from three to six
hours , and come back with an excuse that sounded genuine from its very
simplicity . Another sister of hers lay ill in an isolated hut , alone and
uncared for , except by the teacher &apos;s wife , and occasionally by a poor pa
outcast who had negro blood in her veins , and a love for a white loafer .
God help her ! All of which sounds strange , considering that Maoris are
very kind to each other . The schoolmistress sent August one night to
stay with the sick Maori woman and help her as she could , and gave her
strict instructions to come to the cottage first thing in the morning ,
and tell her how the sick woman was . August turned up at lunch @-@ time next
day . The teacher gave her her first lecture , and said plainly that he
wasn &apos;t to be taken for a fool ; then he stepped aside to get cool , and ,
when he returned , the girl was sobbing as if her heart would break , and
the wife comforting her . She had been up all night , poor girl , and was
thoroughly worn out . Somehow the teacher didn &apos;t feel uncomfortable about
it . He went down to the whare . August had not touched a dishcloth or
broom . She had slept , as she always did , like a pig , all night , while
her sister lay and tossed in agony ; in the morning she ate everything
there was to eat in the house ( which , it seemed , was the Maori way of
showing sympathy in sickness and trouble ) , after which she brooded
by the fire till the children , running out of school , announced the
teacher &apos;s lunch hour .

August braced up again for a little while . The master thought of the
trouble they had with Ayacanora in &quot; Westward Ho &quot; , and was comforted , and
tackled his romance again . Then the schoolmistress fell sick and things
went wrong . The groceries went down faster than ever , and the house got
very dirty , and began to have a native smell about it . August grew fat ,
and lazy , and dirty , and less reliable on washing @-@ days , or when there
was anything special to do in the house . &quot; The savage blood is strong , &quot;
thought the teacher , &quot; and she is beginning to long for her own people
and free unconventional life . &quot; One morning -- on a washing @-@ day , too , as it
happened -- she called out , before the teacher and his wife were up , that
the Maoris who supplied them with milk were away , and she had promised
to go up and milk the cow and bring the milk down . The teacher gave her
permission . One of the scholars usually brought the milk early . Lunch
time came and no August , no milk -- strangest of all , only half the school
children . The teacher put on his hat , and went up to the pa once more .
He found August squatted in the midst of a circle of relations . She was
entertaining them with one of a series of idealistic sketches of the
teacher &apos;s domestic life , in which she showed a very vivid imagination ,
and exhibited an unaccountable savage sort of pessimism . Her intervals
of absence had been occupied in this way from the first . The astounding
slanders she had circulated concerning the teacher &apos;s private life came
back , bit by bit , to his ears for a year afterwards , and her character
sketches of previous teachers , and her own relations -- for she spared
nobody -- would have earned a white woman a long and well @-@ merited term of
imprisonment for criminal libel . She had cunningly , by straightforward
and unscrupulous lying , prejudiced the principal mother and boss woman
of the pa against the teacher and his wife ; as a natural result of which
the old lady , who , like the rest , was very ignorant and ungrateful ,
&quot; turned nasty &quot; and kept the children from school . The teacher lost
his temper , so the children were rounded up and hurried down to
school immediately ; with them came August and her aunt , with alleged
explanations and excuses , and a shell @-@ fish . The aunt and sisters said
they &apos;d have nothing to do with August . They didn &apos;t want her and wouldn &apos;t
have her . The teacher said that , under those circumstances , she &apos;d better
go and drown herself ; so she went home with them .

The whole business had been a plot by her nearest relations . They
got rid of the trouble and expense of keeping her , and the bother of
borrowing in person , whenever in need of trifles in the grocery line .
Borrowing recommenced with her dismissal ; but the teacher put a full
stop to it , as far as he was concerned . Then August , egged on by her
aunt , sent a blackguardly letter to the teacher &apos;s wife ; the sick sister ,
by the way , who had been nursed and supplied with food by her all along ,
was in it , and said she was glad August sent the letter , and it served
the schoolmistress right . The teacher went up to the pa once more ; an
hour later , August in person , accompanied , as usual , by a relation
or two , delivered at the cottage an abject apology in writing , the
composition of which would have discouraged the most enthusiastic
advocate of higher education for the lower classes .

Then various petty annoyances were tried . The teacher is firmly
convinced that certain animal @-@ like sounds round the house at night were
due to August &apos;s trying to find out whether his wife was as likely to be
haunted as the Maoris were . He didn &apos;t dream of such a thing at the time ,
for he did not believe that one of them had the pluck to venture out
after dark . But savage superstition must give way to savage hate .
The girl &apos;s last &quot; try @-@ on &quot; was to come down to the school fence , and
ostentatiously sharpen a table @-@ knife on the wires , while she scowled
murderously in the direction of the schoolmistress , who was hanging out
her washing . August looked , in her dark , bushy , Maori hair , a thoroughly
wild savage . Her father had murdered her mother under particularly
brutal circumstances , and the daughter took after her father .

The teacher called her and said : &quot; Now , look here , my lady , the best
thing you can do is to drop that nonsense at once &quot; ( she had dropped the
knife in the ferns behind her ) , &quot; for we &apos;re the wrong sort of people
to try it on with . Now you get out of this and tell your aunt -- she &apos;s
sneaking there in the flax -- what I tell you , and that she &apos;d better clear
out of this quick , or I &apos;ll have a policeman out and take the whole
gang into town in an hour . Now be off , and shut that gate behind you ,
carefully , and fasten it . &quot; She did , and went .

The worst of it was that the August romance copy was useless . Her lies
were even less reliable and picturesque than the common Jones Alley hag
lie . Then the teacher thought of the soft fool he &apos;d been , and that made
him wild . He looked like a fool , and was one to a great extent , but it
wasn &apos;t good policy to take him for one .

Strange to say , he and others had reason to believe that August
respected him , and liked him rather than otherwise ; but she hated his
wife , who had been kind to her , as only a savage can hate . The younger
pupils told the teacher , cheerfully and confidently , that August said
she &apos;d cut Mrs. Lorrens &apos; throat the first chance she got . Next week the
aunt sent down to ask if the teacher could sell her a bar of soap , and
sent the same old shilling ; he was tired of seeing it stuck out in front
of him , so he took it , put it in his pocket , and sent the soap . This
must have discouraged them , for the borrowing industry petered out . He
saw the aunt later on , and she told him , cheerfully , that August was
going to live with a half @-@ caste in a certain house in town .

Poor August ! For she was only a tool after all . Her &quot; romance &quot; was
briefly as follows : -- She went , per off @-@ hand Maori arrangement , as
&apos;housekeeper &apos; in the hut of a labourer at a neighbouring saw @-@ mill . She
stayed three months , for a wonder ; at the expiration of which time she
put on her hat and explained that she was tired of stopping there , and
was going home . He said , &apos; All right , Sarah , wait a while and I &apos;ll take
you home . &apos; At the door of her aunt &apos;s house he said , &apos; Well , good @-@ bye ,
Sarah , &apos; and she said , in her brooding way , &apos; Good @-@ bye , Jim . &apos; And that was
all .

As the last apparent result of August &apos;s mischief @-@ making , her brother
or someone one evening rode up to the cottage , drunk and inclined to
bluster . He was accompanied by a friend , also drunk , who came to see the
fun , and was ready to use his influence on the winning side . The teacher
went inside , brought out his gun , and slipped two cartridges in .
&quot; I &apos;ve had enough of this , &quot; he said . &quot; Now then , be off , you insolent
blackguards , or I &apos;ll shoot you like rabbits . Go ! &quot; and he snapped his jaw
and the breech of his gun together . As they rode off , the old local hawk
happened to soar close over a dead lamb in the fern at the corner of the
garden , and the teacher , who had been &quot; laying &quot; for him a long time , let
fly both barrels at him , without thinking . When he turned , there was
only a cloud of dust down the track .

. . . . .

The teacher taught that school for three years thereafter , without a
hitch . But he went no more on Universal Brotherhood lines . And , for
years after he had gone , his name was spoken of with great respect by
the Maoris .




New Year &apos;s Night



It was dark enough for anything in Dead Man &apos;s Gap -- a round , warm , close
darkness , in which retreating sounds seemed to be cut off suddenly at a
distance of a hundred yards or so , instead of growing faint and fainter ,
and dying away , to strike the ear once or twice again -- and after
minutes , it might seem -- with startling distinctness , before being
finally lost in the distance , as it is on clear , frosty nights . So with
the sounds of horses &apos; hoofs , stumbling on the rough bridle @-@ track through
the &quot; saddle &quot; , the clatter of hoof @-@ clipped stones and scrape of gravel
down the hidden &quot; siding &quot; , and the low sound of men &apos;s voices , blurred
and speaking in monosyllables and at intervals it seemed , and in hushed ,
awed tones , as though they carried a corpse . To practical eyes , grown
used to such a darkness , and at the nearest point , the passing blurrs
would have suggested two riders on bush hacks leading a third with an
empty saddle on its back -- a lady &apos;s or &quot; side @-@ saddle &quot; , if one could have
distinguished the horns . They may have struck a soft track or level , or
rounded the buttress of the hill higher up , but before they had time
to reach or round the foot of the spur , blurs , whispers , stumble and
clatter of hoofs , jingle of bridle rings , and the occasional clank
together of stirrup irons , seemed shut off as suddenly and completely as
though a great sound @-@ proof door had swung to behind them .

It was dark enough on the glaringest of days down in the lonely hollow
or &quot; pocket &quot; , between two spurs , at the head of a blind gully behind
Mount Buckaroo , where there was a more or less dusty patch , barely
defined even in broad daylight by a spidery dog @-@ legged fence on
three sides , and a thin &quot; two @-@ rail &quot; ( dignified with the adjective
&quot; split @-@ rail &quot; -- though rails and posts were mostly of saplings split in
halves ) running along the frontage . In about the middle of it a little
slab hut , overshadowed by a big stringy @-@ bark shed , was pointed out as
Johnny Mears &apos;s Farm .

&quot; Black as -- as charcoal , &quot; said Johnny Mears . He had never seen coal , and
was a cautious man , whose ideas came slowly . He stooped , close by the
fence , with his hands on his knees , to &quot; sky &quot; the loom of his big shed
and so get his bearings . He had been to have a look at the penned
calves , and see that all slip @-@ rails were up and pegged , for the words of
John Mears junior , especially when delivered rapidly and shrilly and in
injured tones , were not to be relied upon in these matters .

&quot; It &apos;s hot enough to melt the belly out of my fiddle , &quot; said Johnny Mears
to his wife , who sat on a three @-@ legged stool by the rough table in the
little whitewashed &quot; end @-@ room &quot; , putting a patch of patches over the seat
of a pair of moleskin knickerbockers . He lit his pipe , moved a stool
to the side of the great empty fireplace , where it looked cooler -- might
have been cooler on account of a possible draught suggested by the
presence of the chimney , and where , therefore , he felt a breath
cooler . He took his fiddle from a convenient shelf , tuned it slowly and
carefully , holding his pipe ( in his mouth ) well up and to one side , as
if the fiddle were an inquisitive and restless baby . He played &quot; Little
Drops o &apos; Brandy &quot; three times , right through , without variations ,
blinking solemnly the while ; then he put the violin carefully back in
its box , and started to cut up another pipeful .

&quot; You should have gone , Johnny , &quot; said the haggard little woman .

&quot; Rackin &apos; the horse out a night like this , &quot; retorted Johnny , &quot; and
startin &apos; ploughin &apos; to @-@ morrow . It ain &apos;t worth while . Let them come for me
if they want me . Dance on a night like this ! Why ! they &apos;ll dance in -- -- &quot;

&quot; But you promised . It won &apos;t do you no good , Johnny . &quot;

&quot; It won &apos;t do me no harm . &quot;

The little woman went on stitching .

&quot; It &apos;s smotherin &apos; hot , &quot; said Johnny , with an impatient oath . &quot; I don &apos;t
know whether I &apos;ll turn in , or turn out , under the shed to @-@ night . It &apos;s
too d -- -- d hot to roost indoors . &quot;

She bent her head lower over the patch . One smoked and the other
stitched in silence for twenty minutes or so , during which time Johnny
might be supposed to have been deliberating listlessly as to whether
he &apos;d camp out on account of the heat , or turn in . But he broke the
silence with a clout at a mosquito on the nape of his neck , and a bad
word .

&quot; I wish you wouldn &apos;t swear so much , Johnny , &quot; she said wearily -- &quot; at least
not to @-@ night . &quot;

He looked at her blankly .

&quot; Why -- why to @-@ night ? What &apos;s the matter with you to @-@ night , Mary ? What &apos;s
to @-@ night more than any other night to you ? I see no harm -- can &apos;t a man
swear when a mosquito sticks him ? &quot;

&quot; I -- I was only thinking of the boys , Johnny . &quot;

&quot; The boys ! Why , they &apos;re both on the hay in the shed . &quot; He stared at
her again , shifted uneasily , crossed the other leg tightly , frowned ,
blinked , and reached for the matches . &quot; You look a bit off @-@ colour , Mary .
It &apos;s the heat that makes us all a bit ratty at times . Better put that by
and have a swill o &apos; oatmeal and water , and turn in . &quot;

&quot; It &apos;s too hot to go to bed . I couldn &apos;t sleep . I &apos;m all right . I &apos;ll -- I &apos;ll
just finish this . Just reach me a drink from the water @-@ bag -- the
pannikin &apos;s on the hob there , by your boot . &quot;

He scratched his head helplessly , and reached for the drink . When he
sat down again , he felt strangely restless . &quot; Like a hen that didn &apos;t know
where to lay , &quot; he put it . He couldn &apos;t settle down or keep still , and
didn &apos;t seem to enjoy his pipe somehow . He rubbed his head again .

&quot; There &apos;s a thunderstorm comin &apos; , &quot; he said . &quot; That &apos;s what it is ; and the
sooner it comes the better . &quot;

He went to the back door , and stared at the blackness to the east , and ,
sure enough , lightning was blinking there .

&quot; It &apos;s coming , sure enough ; just hang out and keep cool for another hour ,
and you &apos;ll feel the difference . &quot;

He sat down again on the three @-@ legged stool , folded his arms , with his
elbows on his knees , drew a long breath , and blinked at the clay floor
for a while ; then he twisted the stool round on one leg , until he faced
the old @-@ fashioned spired wooden clock ( the brass disc of the pendulum
moving ghost @-@ like through a scarred and scratched marine scene -- Margate
in England -- on the glass that covered the lower half ) that stood alone
on the slab shelf over the fireplace . The hands indicated half @-@ past
two , and Johnny , who had studied that clock and could &quot; hit the time nigh
enough by it , &quot; after knitting his brows and blinking at the dial for a
full minute by its own hand , decided &quot; that it must be getting on toward
nine o &apos;clock . &quot;

It must have been the heat . Johnny stood up , raking his hair , turned to
the door and back again , and then , after an impatient gesture , took up
his fiddle and raised it to his shoulder . Then the queer thing happened .
He said afterwards , under conditions favourable to such sentimental
confidence , that a cold hand seemed to take hold of the bow , through
his , and -- anyway , before he knew what he was about he had played the
first bars of &quot; When First I Met Sweet Peggy &quot; , a tune he had played
often , twenty years before , in his courting days , and had never happened
to play since . He sawed it right through ( the cold hand left after the
first bar or two ) standing up ; then still stood with fiddle and bow
trembling in his hands , with the queer feeling still on him , and a
rush of old thoughts going through his head , all of which he set down
afterwards to the effect of the heat . He put the fiddle away hastily ,
damning the bridge of it at the same time in loud but hurried tones ,
with the idea of covering any eccentricity which the wife might have
noticed in his actions . &quot; Must &apos; a &apos; got a touch o &apos; sun , &quot; he muttered
to himself . He sat down , fumbled with knife , pipe , and tobacco , and
presently stole a furtive glance over his shoulder at his wife .

The washed @-@ out little woman was still sewing , but stitching blindly , for
great tears were rolling down her worn cheeks .

Johnny , white @-@ faced on account of the heat , stood close behind her ,
one hand on her shoulder and the other clenched on the table ; but the
clenched hand shook as badly as the loose one .

&quot; Good God ! What is the matter , Mary ? You &apos;re sick ! &quot; ( They had had little
or no experience of illness . ) &quot; Tell me , Mary -- come now ! Has the boys
been up to anything ? &quot;

&quot; No , Johnny ; it &apos;s not that . &quot;

&quot; What is it then ? You &apos;re taken sick ! What have you been doing with
yourself ? It might be fever . Hold up a minute . You wait here quiet while
I roost out the boys and send &apos; em for the doctor and someone -- -- &quot;

&quot; No ! no ! I &apos;m not sick , John . It &apos;s only a turn . I &apos;ll be all right in a
minute . &quot;

He shifted his hand to her head , which she dropped suddenly , with a
life @-@ weary sigh , against his side .

&quot; Now then ! &quot; cried Johnny , wildly , &quot; don &apos;t you faint or go into
disterricks , Mary ! It &apos;ll upset the boys ; think of the boys ! It &apos;s only
the heat -- you &apos;re only takin &apos; queer . &quot;

&quot; It &apos;s not that ; you ought to know me better than that . It
was -- I -- Johnny , I was only thinking -- we &apos;ve been married twenty years
to @-@ night -- an &apos; -- it &apos;s New Year &apos;s Night ! &quot;

&quot; And I &apos;ve never thought of it ! &quot; said Johnny ( in the afterwards ) . &quot; Shows
what a God @-@ forgotten selection will make of a man . She &apos;d thought of it
all the time , and was waiting for it to strike me . Why ! I &apos;d agreed to go
and play at a darnce at Old Pipeclay School @-@ house all night -- that very
night -- and leave her at home because she hadn &apos;t asked to come ; and
it never struck me to ask her -- at home by herself in that hole -- for
twenty @-@ five bob . And I only stopped at home because I &apos;d got the hump ,
and knew they &apos;d want me bad at the school . &quot;

They sat close together on the long stool by the table , shy and awkward
at first ; and she clung to him at opening of thunder , and they started
apart guiltily when the first great drops sounded like footsteps on the
gravel outside , just as they &apos;d done one night @-@ time before -- twenty years
before .

If it was dark before , it was black now . The edge of the awful
storm @-@ cloud rushed up and under the original darkness like the best
&quot; drop &quot; black @-@ brushed over the cheap &quot; lamp &quot; variety , turning it grey by
contrast . The deluge lasted only a quarter of an hour ; but it cleared
the night , and did its work . There was hail before it , too -- big as emu
eggs , the boys said -- that lay feet deep in the old diggers &apos; holes on
Pipeclay for days afterwards -- weeks some said .

The two sweethearts of twenty years ago and to @-@ night watched the retreat
of the storm , and , seeing Mount Buckaroo standing clear , they went to
the back door , which opened opposite the end of the shed , and saw to the
east a glorious arch of steel @-@ blue , starry sky , with the distant peaks
showing clear and blue away back under the far @-@ away stars in the depth
of it .

They lingered awhile -- arms round each other &apos;s waists -- before she called
the boys , just as they had done this time of night twenty years ago ,
after the boys &apos; grandmother had called her .

&quot; Awlright , mother ! &quot; bawled back the boys , with unfilial independence
of Australian youth . &quot; We &apos;re awlright ! We &apos;ll be in directly ! Wasn &apos;t it a
pelterer , mother ? &quot;

They went in and sat down again . The embarrassment began to wear off .

&quot; We &apos;ll get out of this , Mary , &quot; said Johnny . &quot; I &apos;ll take Mason &apos;s offer
for the cattle and things , and take that job of Dawson &apos;s , boss or no
boss &quot; -- ( Johnny &apos;s bad luck was due to his inability in the past to &quot; get
on &quot; with any boss for any reasonable length of time ) -- &quot; I can get the
boys on , too . They &apos;re doing no good here , and growing up . It ain &apos;t doing
justice to them ; and , what &apos;s more , this life is killin &apos; you , Mary . That
settles it ! I was blind . Let the jumpt @-@ up selection go ! It &apos;s making a
wall @-@ eyed bullock of me , Mary -- a dry @-@ rotted rag of a wall @-@ eyed bullock
like Jimmy Nowlett &apos;s old Strawberry . And you &apos;ll live in town like a
lady . &quot;

&quot; Somebody coming ! &quot; yelled the boys .

There was a clatter of sliprails hurriedly thrown down , and clipped by
horses &apos; hoofs .

&quot; Insoide there ! Is that you , Johnny ? &quot;

&quot; Yes ! &quot; ( &quot; I knew they &apos;d come for you , &quot; said Mrs. Mears to Johnny . )

&quot; You &apos;ll have to come , Johnny . There &apos;s no get out of it . Here &apos;s Jim
Mason with me , and we &apos;ve got orders to stun you and pack you if you show
fight . The blessed fiddler from Mudgee didn &apos;t turn up . Dave Regan burst
his concertina , and they &apos;re in a fix . &quot;

&quot; But I can &apos;t leave the missus . &quot;

&quot; That &apos;s all right . We &apos;ve got the school missus &apos;s mare and side @-@ saddle .
She says you ought to be jolly well ashamed of yourself , Johnny Mears ,
for not bringing your wife on New Year &apos;s Night . And so you ought ! &quot;

Johnny did not look shame @-@ faced , for reasons unknown to them .

&quot; The boys couldn &apos;t find the horses , &quot; put in Mrs. Mears . &quot; Johnny was just
going down the gully again . &quot;

He gave her a grateful look , and felt a strange , new thrill of
admiration for his wife .

&quot; And -- there &apos;s a bottle of the best put by for you , Johnny , &quot; added Pat
McDurmer , mistaking Johnny &apos;s silence ; &quot; and we &apos;ll call it thirty bob ! &quot;
( Johnny &apos;s ideas were coming slowly again , after the recent rush . )
&quot; Or -- two quid ! -- there you are ! &quot;

&quot; I don &apos;t want two quid , nor one either , for taking my wife to a dance on
New Year &apos;s Night ! &quot; said Johnny Mears . &quot; Run and put on your best bib and
tucker , Mary . &quot;

And she hurried to dress as eager and excited , and smiling to herself
as girlishly as she had done on such occasions on evenings before the
bright New Year &apos;s Night twenty years ago . -- For a related story , see &quot; A
Bush Dance &quot; , in &quot; Joe Wilson and His Mates &quot; . -- A. L. , 1998 . --




Black Joe



They called him Black Joe , and me White Joe , by way of distinction and
for the convenience of his boss ( my uncle ) , and my aunt , and mother ; so ,
when we heard the cry of &quot; Bla @-@ a @-@ ack Joe ! &quot; ( the adjective drawn out until
it became a screech , after several repetitions , and the &quot; Joe &quot; short
and sharp ) coming across the flat in a woman &apos;s voice , Joe knew that the
missus wanted him at the house , to get wood or water , or mind the baby ,
and he kept carefully out of sight ; he went at once when uncle called .
And when we heard the cry of &quot; Wh @-@ i @-@ i @-@ te Joe ! &quot; which we did with
difficulty and after several tries -- though Black Joe &apos;s ears were of the
keenest -- we knew that I was overdue at home , or absent without leave ,
and was probably in for a warming , as the old folk called it . On some
occasions I postponed the warming as long as my stomach held out , which
was a good while in five @-@ corner , native @-@ cherry , or yam season -- but the
warming was none the cooler for being postponed .

Sometimes Joe heard the wrong adjective , or led me to believe he
did -- and left me for a whole afternoon under the impression that the
race of Ham was in demand at the homestead , when I myself was wanted
there , and maternal wrath was increasing every moment of my absence .

But Joe knew that my conscience was not so elastic as his , and -- well ,
you must expect little things like this in all friendships .

Black Joe was somewhere between nine and twelve when I first met him ,
on a visit to my uncle &apos;s station ; I was somewhere in those years too .
He was very black , the darker for being engaged in the interesting but
uncertain occupation of &quot; burning off &quot; in his spare time -- which wasn &apos;t
particularly limited . He combined shepherding , &apos; possum and kangaroo
hunting , crawfishing , sleeping , and various other occupations and
engagements with that of burning off . I was very white , being a sickly
town boy ; but , as I took great interest in burning off , and was not
particularly fond of cold water -- it was in winter time -- the difference
in our complexions was not so marked at times .

Black Joe &apos;s father , old Black Jimmie , lived in a gunyah on the rise
at the back of the sheepyards , and shepherded for my uncle . He was a
gentle , good @-@ humoured , easy @-@ going old fellow with a pleasant smile ;
which description applies , I think , to most old blackfellows in
civilisation . I was very partial to the old man , and chummy with him ,
and used to slip away from the homestead whenever I could , and squat
by the campfire along with the other piccaninnies , and think , and
yarn socially with Black Jimmie by the hour . I would give something to
remember those conversations now . Sometimes somebody would be sent to
bring me home , when it got too late , and Black Jimmie would say :

&quot; Piccaninnie alonga possum rug , &quot; and there I &apos;d be , sound asleep , with
the other young Australians .

I liked Black Jimmie very much , and would willingly have adopted him
as a father . I should have been quite content to spend my days in the
scrub , enjoying life in dark and savage ways , and my nights &quot; alonga
possum rug &quot; ; but the family had other plans for my future .

It was a case of two blackfellows and one gin , when Black Jimmie went
a @-@ wooing -- about twelve years before I made his acquaintance -- and he
fought for his bride in the black fashion . It was the last affair of
that kind in the district . My uncle &apos;s brother professed to have been
present at the fight , and gave me an alleged description of it . He said
that they drew lots , and Black Jimmie put his hands on his knees and
bent his head , and the other blackfellow hit him a whack on the skull
with a nulla nulla . Then they had a nip of rum all round -- Black Jimmie
must have wanted it , for the nulla nulla was knotted , and heavy , and
made in the most approved fashion . Then the other blackfellow bent his
head , and Jimmie took the club and returned the whack with interest .
Then the other fellow hit Jimmie a lick , and took a clout in return .
Then they had another drink , and continued thus until Jimmie &apos;s rival
lost all heart and interest in the business . But you couldn &apos;t take
everything my uncle &apos;s brother said for granted .

Black Mary was a queen by right , and had the reputation of being
the cleanest gin in the district ; she was a great favourite with the
squatters &apos; wives round there . Perhaps she hoped to reclaim Jimmie -- he
was royal , too , but held easy views with regard to religion and the
conventionalities of civilisation . Mary insisted on being married
properly by a clergyman , made the old man build a decent hut , had all
her children christened , and kept him and them clean and tidy up to the
time of her death .

Poor Queen Mary was ambitious . She started to educate her children ,
and when they got beyond her -- that is when they had learnt their
letters -- she was grateful for any assistance from the good @-@ natured bush
men and women of her acquaintance . She had decided to get her eldest boy
into the mounted police , and had plans for the rest , and she worked hard
for them , too . Jimmie offered no opposition , and gave her no assistance
beyond the rations and money he earned shepherding -- which was as much as
could be expected of him .

He did as many husbands do &quot; for the sake of peace and quietness &quot; -- he
drifted along in the wake of his wife , and took things as easily as her
schemes of reformation and education would allow him to .

Queen Mary died before her time , respected by all who knew or had heard
of her . The nearest squatter &apos;s wife sent a pair of sheets for a shroud ,
with instructions to lay Mary out , and arranged ( by bush telegraph ) to
drive over next morning with her sister @-@ in @-@ law and two other white women
in the vicinity , to see Mary decently buried .

But the remnant of Jimmie &apos;s tribe were there beforehand . They tore the
sheets in strips and tied Mary up in a bundle , with her chin to her
knees -- preparing her for burial in their own fashion -- and mourned all
night in whitewash and ashes . At least , the gins did . The white women
saw that it was hopeless to attempt to untie any of the innumerable
knots and double knots , even if it had been possible to lay Mary out
afterwards ; so they had to let her be buried as she was , with black and
white obsequies . And we &apos;ve got no interest in believing that she did not
&quot; jump up white woman &quot; long ago .

My uncle and his brother took the two eldest boys . Black Jimmie
shifted away from the hut at once with the rest of his family -- for the
&quot; devil @-@ devil &quot; sat down there -- and Mary &apos;s name was strictly &quot; tabooed &quot; in
accordance with aboriginal etiquette .

Jimmie drifted back towards the graves of his fathers in company with
a decreasing flock of sheep day by day ( for the house of my uncle had
fallen on times of drought and depression , and foot @-@ rot and wool rings ,
and over @-@ drafts and bank owners ) , and a few strips of bark , a dying
fire , a black pipe , some greasy &apos; possum rugs and blankets , a litter of
kangaroo tails , etc . , four neglected piccaninnies , half a score of mangy
mongrels , and , haply , a &quot; lilly drap o &apos; rum &quot; , by night .

The four little Australians grew dirtier and more shy and savage , and
ate underdone kangaroo and &apos; possum and native bear , with an occasional
treat of oak grubs and goanna by preference -- and died out , one by
one , as blacks do when brought within the ever widening circle of
civilisation . Jimmie moved promptly after each death , and left the
evil one in possession , and built another mia @-@ mia -- each one being less
pretentious than the last . Finally he was left , the last of his tribe ,
to mourn his lot in solitude .

But the devil @-@ devil came and sat down by King Jimmie &apos;s side one night ,
so he , too , moved out across the Old Man border , and the mia @-@ mia rotted
into the ground and the grass grew there .

. . . . .

I admired Joe ; I thought him wiser and cleverer than any white boy in
the world . He could smell out &apos; possums unerringly , and I firmly believed
he could see yards through the muddiest of dam water ; for once , when I
dropped my boat in , and was not sure of the spot , he fished it out first
try . With cotton reels and bits of stick and bark he would make the
model of a station homestead , slaughter @-@ yards , sheep @-@ yards , and all
complete , working in ideas and improvements of his own which might
have been put into practice with advantage . He was a most original and
interesting liar upon all subjects upon which he was ignorant and
which came up incidentally . He gave me a very interesting account of an
interview between his father and Queen Victoria , and mentioned casually
that his father had walked across the Thames without getting wet .

He also told me how he , Joe , had tied a mounted trooper to a verandah
post and thrashed him with pine saplings until the timber gave out and
he was tired . I questioned Jimmie , but the incidents seemed to have
escaped the old king &apos;s memory .

Joe could build bigger woodheaps with less wood than any black or white
tramp or loafer round there . He was a born architect . He took a world
of pains with his wood @-@ heaps -- he built them hollow , in the shape of a
break @-@ wind , with the convex side towards the house for the benefit of
his employers . Joe was easy @-@ going ; he had inherited a love of peace and
quietness from his father . Uncle generally came home after dark , and Joe
would have little fires lit at safe distances all round the house ,
in order to convey an impression that the burning off was proceeding
satisfactorily .

When the warm weather came , Joe and I got into trouble with an old hag
for bathing in a waterhole in the creek in front of her shanty , and she
impounded portions of our wardrobe . We shouldn &apos;t have lost much if she
had taken it all ; but our sense of injury was deep , especially as she
used very bad grammar towards us .

Joe addressed her from the safe side of the water . He said , &quot; Look here !
Old leather @-@ face , sugar @-@ eye , plar @-@ bag marmy , I call it you . &quot;

&quot; Plar @-@ bag marmy &quot; meant &quot; Mother Flour @-@ bag &quot; , and ration sugar was
decidedly muddy in appearance .

She came round the waterhole with a clothes prop , and made good time ,
too ; but we got across and away with our clothes .

That little incident might have changed the whole course of my
existence . Plar @-@ bag Marmy made a formal complaint to uncle , who happened
to pass there on horseback about an hour later ; and the same evening
Joe &apos;s latest and most carefully planned wood heap collapsed while aunt
was pulling a stick out of it in the dark , and it gave her a bad scare ,
the results of which might have been serious .

So uncle gave us a thrashing , without the slightest regard for racial
distinctions , and sent us to bed without our suppers .

We sought Jimmie &apos;s camp , but Joe got neither sympathy nor damper from
his father , and I was sent home with a fatherly lecture &quot; for going
alonga that fella , &quot; meaning Joe .

Joe and I discussed existence at a waterhole down the creek next
afternoon , over a billy of crawfish which we had boiled and a piece of
gritty damper , and decided to retire beyond the settled districts -- some
five hundred miles or so -- to a place that Joe said he knew of , where
there were lagoons and billabongs ten miles wide , alive with ducks and
fish , and black cockatoos and kangaroos and wombats , that only waited to
be knocked over with a stick .

I thought I might as well start and be a blackfellow at once , so we
got a rusty pan without a handle , and cooked about a pint of fat yellow
oak @-@ grubs ; and I was about to fall to when we were discovered , and the
full weight of combined family influence was brought to bear on the
situation . We had broken a new pair of shears digging out those grubs
from under the bark of the she @-@ oaks , and had each taken a blade as his
own especial property , which we thought was the best thing to do under
the circumstances . Uncle wanted those shears badly , so he received us
with the buggy whip -- and he didn &apos;t draw the colour line either . All
that night and next day I wished he had . I was sent home , and Joe went
droving with uncle soon after that , else I might have lived a life of
freedom and content and died out peacefully with the last of my adopted
tribe .

Joe died of consumption on the track . When he was dying uncle asked : &quot; Is
there anything you would like ? &quot;

And Joe said : &quot; I &apos;d like a lilly drap o &apos; rum , boss . &quot;

Which were his last words , for he drank the rum and died peacefully .

I was the first to hear the news at home , and , being still a youngster ,
I ran to the house , crying &quot; Oh , mother ! aunt &apos;s Joe is dead ! &quot;

There were visitors at our place at the time , and , as the eldest child
of the maternal aunt in question had also been christened Joe -- after a
grandfather of our tribe ( my tribe , not Black Joe &apos;s ) -- the news caused
a sudden and unpleasant sensation . But cross @-@ examination explained the
mistake , and I retired to the rear of the pig @-@ sty , as was my custom when
things went wrong , with another cause for grief .




They Wait on the Wharf in Black

&quot; Seems to me that honest , hard @-@ working men seem to accumulate
the heaviest swags of trouble in this world . &quot; -- Steelman .

Told by Mitchell &apos;s Mate .



We were coming back from West Australia , steerage -- Mitchell , the Oracle ,
and I. I had gone over saloon , with a few pounds in my pocket . Mitchell
said this was a great mistake -- I should have gone over steerage with
nothing but the clothes I stood upright in , and come back saloon with a
pile . He said it was a very common mistake that men made , but , as far
as his experience went , there always seemed to be a deep @-@ rooted popular
prejudice in favour of going away from home with a few pounds in one &apos;s
pocket and coming back stumped ; at least amongst rovers and vagabonds
like ourselves -- it wasn &apos;t so generally popular or admired at home , or in
the places we came back to , as it was in the places we went to . Anyway
it went , there wasn &apos;t the slightest doubt that our nearest and dearest
friends were , as a rule , in favour of our taking away as little as we
could possibly manage with , and coming back with a pile , whether we came
back saloon or not ; and that ought to settle the matter as far as any
chap that had the slightest consideration for his friends or family was
concerned .

There was a good deal of misery , underneath , coming home in that
steerage . One man had had his hand crushed and amputated out Coolgardie
way , and the stump had mortified , and he was being sent to Melbourne by
his mates . Some had lost their money , some a couple of years of their
life , some their souls ; but none seemed to have lost the heart to
call up the quiet grin that southern rovers , vagabonds , travellers for
&quot; graft &quot; or fortune , and professional wanderers wear in front of it
all . Except one man -- an elderly eastern digger -- he had lost his wife in
Sydney while he was away .

They sent him a wire to the Boulder Soak , or somewhere out back of
White Feather , to say that his wife was seriously ill ; but the wire went
wrong , somehow , after the manner of telegrams not connected with mining ,
on the lines of &quot; the Western &quot; . They sent him a wire to say that his wife
was dead , and that reached him all right -- only a week late .

I can imagine it . He got the message at dinner @-@ time , or when they came
back to the camp . His mate wanted him to sit in the shade , or lie in
the tent , while he got the billy boiled . &quot; You must brace up and pull
yourself together , Tom , for the sake of the youngsters . &quot; And Tom for
long intervals goes walking up and down , up and down , by the camp -- under
the brassy sky or the gloaming -- under the brilliant star @-@ clusters that
hang over the desert plain , but never raising his eyes to them ; kicking
a tuft of grass or a hole in the sand now and then , and seeming to watch
the progress of the track he is tramping out . The wife of twenty years
was with him -- though two thousand miles away -- till that message came .

I can imagine Tome sitting with his mates round the billy , they talking
in quiet , subdued tones about the track , the departure of coaches ,
trains and boats -- arranging for Tom &apos;s journey East , and the working of
the claim in his absence . Or Tom lying on his back in his bunk , with his
hands under his head and his eyes fixed on the calico above -- thinking ,
thinking , thinking . Thinking , with a touch of his boyhood &apos;s faith
perhaps ; or wondering what he had done in his long , hard @-@ working married
life , that God should do this thing to him now , of all times .

&quot; You &apos;d best take what money we have in the camp , Tom ; you &apos;ll want it
all ag &apos;in &apos; the time you get back from Sydney , and we can fix it up
arterwards .... There &apos;s a couple o &apos; clean shirts o &apos; mine -- you &apos;d best take
&apos;em -- you &apos;ll want &apos; em on the voyage .... You might as well take them there
new pants o &apos; mine , they &apos;ll only dry @-@ rot out here -- and the coat , too ,
if you like -- it &apos;s too small for me , anyway . You won &apos;t have any time in
Perth , and you &apos;ll want some decent togs to land with in Sydney . &quot;

. . . . .

&quot; I wouldn &apos;t &apos; a &apos; cared so much if I &apos;d &apos; a &apos; seen the last of her , &quot; he said ,
in a quiet , patient voice , to us one night by the rail . &quot; I would &apos; a&apos;
liked to have seen the last of her . &quot;

&quot; Have you been long in the West ? &quot;

&quot; Over two years . I made up to take a run across last Christmas , and have
a look at &apos; em . But I couldn &apos;t very well get away when &apos; exemption @-@ time&apos;
came . I didn &apos;t like to leave the claim . &quot;

&quot; Do any good over there ? &quot;

&quot; Well , things brightened up a bit the last month or two . I had a hard
pull at first ; landed without a penny , and had to send back every
shilling I could rake up to get things straightened up a bit at home .
Then the eldest boy fell ill , and then the baby . I &apos;d reckoned on
bringing &apos; em over to Perth or Coolgardie when the cool weather came , and
having them somewheres near me , where I could go and have a look at &apos; em
now and then , and look after them . &quot;

&quot; Going back to the West again ? &quot;

&quot; Oh , yes . I must go for the sake of the youngsters . But I don &apos;t seem
to have much heart in it . &quot; He smoked awhile . &quot; Over twenty years we
struggled along together -- the missus and me -- and it seems hard that I
couldn &apos;t see the last of her . It &apos;s rough on a man . &quot;

&quot; The world is damned rough on a man sometimes , &quot; said Mitchell , &quot; most
especially when he least deserves it . &quot;

The digger crossed his arms on the rail like an old &quot; cocky &quot; at the fence
in the cool of the evening , yarning with an old crony .

&quot; Mor &apos;n twenty years she stuck to me and struggled along by my side . She
never give in . I &apos;ll swear she was on her feet till the last , with
her sleeves tucked up -- bustlin &apos; round .... And just when things was
brightening and I saw a chance of giving her a bit of a rest and comfort
for the end of her life .... I thought of it all only t &apos;other week when
things was clearing up ahead ; and the last &apos; order &apos; I sent over I set
to work and wrote her a long letter , putting all the good news and
encouragement I could think of into it . I thought how that letter would
brighten up things at home , and how she &apos;d read it round . I thought of
lots of things that a man never gets time to think of while his nose is
kept to the grindstone . And she was dead and in her grave , and I never
knowed it . &quot;

Mitchell dug his elbow into my ribs and made signs for the matches to
light his pipe .

&quot; An &apos; yer never knowed , &quot; reflected the Oracle .

&quot; But I always had an idea when there was trouble at home , &quot; the digger
went on presently , in his quiet , patient tone . &quot; I always knowed ; I
always had a kind of feeling that way -- I felt it -- no matter how far I
was away . When the youngsters was sick I knowed it , and I expected the
letter that come . About a fortnight ago I had a feeling that way when
the wife was ill . The very stars out there on the desert by the Boulder
Soak seemed to say : &apos; There &apos;s trouble at home . Go home . There &apos;s trouble
at home . &apos; But I never dreamed what that trouble was . One night I did
make up my mind to start in the morning , but when the morning came I
hadn &apos;t an excuse , and was ashamed to tell my mates the truth . They might
have thought I was going ratty , like a good many go out there . &quot; Then he
broke off with a sort of laugh , as if it just struck him that we
might think he was a bit off his head , or that his talk was getting
uncomfortable for us . &quot; Curious , ain &apos;t it ? &quot; he said .

&quot; Reminds me of a case I knowed , -- -- &quot; commenced the Oracle , after a
pause .

I could have pitched him overboard ; but that was a mistake . He and the
old digger sat on the for &apos;ard hatch half the night yarning , mostly about
queer starts , and rum go &apos;s , and curious cases the Oracle had knowed ,
and I think the Oracle did him a lot of good somehow , for he seemed more
cheerful in the morning .

We were overcrowded in the steerage , but Mitchell managed to give up his
berth to the old digger without letting him know it . Most of the chaps
seemed anxious to make a place at the first table and pass the first
helpings of the dishes to the &quot; old cove that had lost his missus . &quot;

They all seemed to forget him as we entered the Heads ; they had their
own troubles to attend to . They were in the shadow of the shame of
coming back hard up , and the grins began to grow faint and sickly . But I
didn &apos;t forget him . I wish sometimes that I didn &apos;t take so much notice of
things .

There was no mistaking them -- the little group that stood apart near the
end of the wharf , dressed in cheap black . There was the eldest single
sister -- thin , pale , and haggard @-@ looking -- that had had all the hard
worry in the family till her temper was spoilt , as you could see by the
peevish , irritable lines in her face . She had to be the mother of them
all now , and had never known , perhaps , what it was to be a girl or a
sweetheart . She gave a hard , mechanical sort of smile when she saw her
father , and then stood looking at the boat in a vacant , hopeless sort of
way . There was the baby , that he saw now for the first time , crowing and
jumping at the sight of the boat coming in ; there was the eldest boy ,
looking awkward and out of place in his new slop @-@ suit of black , shifting
round uneasily , and looking anywhere but at his father . But the little
girl was the worst , and a pretty little girl she was , too ; she never
took her streaming eyes off her father &apos;s face the whole time . You could
see that her little heart was bursting , and with pity for him . They were
too far apart to speak to each other as yet . The boat seemed a cruel
long long time swinging alongside -- I wished they &apos;d hurry up . He &apos;d
brought his traps up early , and laid &apos; em on the deck under the rail ; he
stood very quiet with his hands behind him , looking at his children . He
had a strong , square , workman &apos;s face , but I could see his chin and mouth
quivering under the stubbly , iron @-@ grey beard , and the lump working in
his throat ; and one strong hand gripped the other very tight behind , but
his eyelids never quivered -- only his eyes seemed to grow more and more
sad and lonesome . These are the sort of long , cruel moments when a man
sits or stands very tight and quiet and calm @-@ looking , with his whole
past life going whirling through his brain , year after year , and over
and over again . Just as the digger seemed about to speak to them he met
the brimming eyes of his little girl turned up to his face . He looked
at her for a moment , and then turned suddenly and went below as if
pretending to go down for his things . I noticed that Mitchell -- who
hadn &apos;t seemed to be noticing anything in particular -- followed him down .
When they came on deck again we were right alongside .

&quot; &apos; Ello , Nell ! &quot; said the digger to the eldest daughter .

&quot; &apos; Ello , father ! &quot; she said , with a sort of gasp , but trying to smile .

&quot; &apos; Ello , Jack , how are you getting on ? &quot;

&quot; All right , father , &quot; said the boy , brightening up , and seeming greatly
relieved .

He looked down at the little girl with a smile that I can &apos;t describe ,
but didn &apos;t speak to her . She still stood with quivering chin and mouth
and great brimming eyes upturned , full of such pity as I never saw
before in a child @-@ face -- pity for him .

&quot; You can get ashore now , &quot; said Mitchell ; &quot; see , they &apos;ve got the gangway
out aft . &quot;

Presently I saw Mitchell with the portmanteau in his hand , and the baby
on his arm , steering them away to a quiet corner of the shed at the top
of the wharf . The digger had the little girl in his arms , and both hers
were round his neck , and her face hidden on his shoulder .

When Mitchell came back , he leant on the rail for a while by my side , as
if it was a boundary fence out back , and there was no hurry to break up
camp and make a start .

&quot; What did you follow him below that time for , Mitchell ? &quot; I asked
presently , for want of something better to say .

Mitchell looked at me out of the corners of his eyes .

&quot; I wanted to score a drink ! &quot; he said . &quot; I thought he wanted one and
wouldn &apos;t like to be a Jimmy Woodser . &quot;




Seeing the Last of You



&quot; When you &apos;re going away by boat , &quot; said Mitchell , &quot; you ought to say
good @-@ bye to the women at home , and to the chaps at the last pub . I hate
waiting on the wharf or up on deck when the boat &apos;s behind time . There &apos;s
no sense in it , and a lot of unnecessary misery . Your friends wait on
the wharf and you are kept at the rail to the bitter end , just when they
and you most want a spell . And why ? Some of them hang out because they
love you , and want to see the last of you ; some because they don &apos;t like
you to see them going away without seeing the last of you ; and you hang
out mostly because it would hurt &apos; em if you went below and didn &apos;t give
them a chance of seeing the last of you all the time -- and you curse the
boat and wish to God it would start . And those who love you most -- the
women @-@ folk of the family -- and who are making all the fuss and breaking
their hearts about having to see the last of you , and least want to do
it -- they hang out the longest , and are the most determined to see it .
Where &apos;s the sense in it ? What &apos;s the good of seeing the last of you ? How
do women manage to get consolation out of a thing like that ?

&quot; But women get consolation out of queer things sometimes , &quot; he added
reflectively , &quot; and so do men .

&quot; I remember when I was knocking about the coasts , an old aunt of mine
always persisted in coming down to see the last of me , and bringing the
whole family too -- no matter if I was only going away for a month . I was
her favourite . I always turned up again in a few months ; but if I &apos;d come
back every next boat it wouldn &apos;t have made the slightest difference to
her . She &apos;d say that I mightn &apos;t come back some day , and then she &apos;d never
forgive herself nor the family for not seeing me off . I suppose she &apos;ll
see the end of me yet if she lives long enough -- and she &apos;s a wiry old
lady of the old school . She was old @-@ fashioned and dressed like a fright ,
they said at home . They hated being seen in public with her ; to tell the
truth , I felt a bit ashamed , too , at times . I wouldn &apos;t be , now . When I &apos;d
get her off on to the wharf I &apos;d be overcome with my feelings , and have
to retire to the privacy of the bar to hide my emotions till the
boat was going . And she &apos;d stand on the end of the pier and wave her
handkerchief and mop her old eyes with it until she was removed by
force .

&quot; God bless her old heart ! There wasn &apos;t so much affection wasted on me
at home that I felt crowded by hers ; and I never lost anything by her
seeing the last of me .

&quot; I do wish the Oracle would stop that confounded fiddle of his -- it makes
you think over damned old things . &quot;




Two Boys at Grinder Brothers&apos;



Five or six half @-@ grown larrikins sat on the cemented sill of the big
window of Grinder Bros. &apos; Railway Coach Factory waiting for the work
bell , and one of the number was Bill Anderson -- known as &quot; Carstor
Hoil &quot; -- a young terror of fourteen or fifteen .

&quot; Here comes Balmy Arvie , &quot; exclaimed Bill as a pale , timid @-@ looking little
fellow rounded the corner and stood against the wall by the door . &quot; How &apos;s
your parents , Balmy ? &quot;

The boy made no answer ; he shrank closer to the entrance . The first bell
went .

&quot; What yer got for dinner , Balmy ? Bread &apos; n &apos; treacle ? &quot; asked the young
ruffian ; then for the edification of his chums he snatched the boy &apos;s
dinner bag and emptied its contents on the pavement .

The door opened . Arvie gathered up his lunch , took his time @-@ ticket , and
hurried in .

&quot; Well , Balmy , &quot; said one of the smiths as he passed , &quot; what do you think
of the boat race ? &quot;

&quot; I think , &quot; said the boy , goaded to reply , &quot; that it would be better if
young fellows of this country didn &apos;t think so much about racin &apos; an&apos;
fightin &apos; . &quot;

The questioner stared blankly for a moment , then laughed suddenly in the
boy &apos;s face , and turned away . The rest grinned .

&quot; Arvie &apos;s getting balmier than ever , &quot; guffawed young Bill .

&quot; Here , Carstor Hoil , &quot; cried one of the smiths &apos; strikers , &quot; how much oil
will you take for a chew of terbaccer ? &quot;

&quot; Teaspoonful ? &quot;

&quot; No , two . &quot;

&quot; All right ; let &apos;s see the chew , first . &quot;

&quot; Oh , you &apos;ll get it . What yer frighten &apos; of ? ... Come on , chaps , &apos; n &apos; see
Bill drink oil . &quot;

Bill measured out some machine oil and drank it . He got the tobacco , and
the others got what they called &quot; the fun of seein &apos; Bill drink oil ! &quot;

The second bell rang , and Bill went up to the other end of the shop ,
where Arvie was already at work sweeping shavings from under a bench .

The young terror seated himself on the end of this bench , drummed his
heels against the leg , and whistled . He was in no hurry , for his foreman
had not yet arrived . He amused himself by lazily tossing chips at
Arvie , who made no protest for a while . &quot; It would be -- better -- for this
country , &quot; said the young terror , reflectively and abstractedly , cocking
his eye at the whitewashed roof beams and feeling behind him on the
bench for a heavier chip -- &quot; it would be better -- for this country -- if
young fellers didn &apos;t think so much about -- about -- racin &apos; -- AND fightin &apos; . &quot;

&quot; You let me alone , &quot; said Arvie .

&quot; Why , what &apos;ll you do ? &quot; exclaimed Bill , bringing his eye down with
feigned surprise . Then , in an indignant tone , &quot; I don &apos;t mind takin &apos; a
fall out of yer , now , if yer like . &quot;

Arvie went on with his work . Bill tossed all the chips within reach , and
then sat carelessly watching some men at work , and whistling the &quot; Dead
March &quot; . Presently he asked :

&quot; What &apos;s yer name , Balmy ? &quot;

No answer .

&quot; Carn &apos;t yer answer a civil question ? I &apos;d soon knock the sulks out of yer
if I was yer father . &quot;

&quot; My name &apos;s Arvie ; you know that . &quot;

&quot; Arvie what ? &quot;

&quot; Arvie Aspinall . &quot;

Bill cocked his eye at the roof and thought a while and whistled ; then
he said suddenly :

&quot; Say , Balmy , where d &apos;yer live ? &quot;

&quot; Jones &apos; Alley . &quot;

&quot; What ? &quot;

&quot; Jones &apos; Alley . &quot;

A short , low whistle from Bill . &quot; What house ? &quot;

&quot; Number Eight . &quot;

&quot; Garn ! What yer giv &apos;nus ? &quot;

&quot; I &apos;m telling the truth . What &apos;s there funny about it ? What do I want to
tell you a lie for ? &quot;

&quot; Why , we lived there once , Balmy . Old folks livin &apos; ? &quot;

&quot; Mother is ; father &apos;s dead . &quot;

Bill scratched the back of his head , protruded his under lip , and
reflected .

&quot; I say , Arvie , what did yer father die of ? &quot;

&quot; Heart disease . He dropped down dead at his work . &quot;

Long , low , intense whistle from Bill . He wrinkled his forehead and
stared up at the beams as if he expected to see something unusual there .
After a while he said , very impressively : &quot; So did mine . &quot;

The coincidence hadn &apos;t done striking him yet ; he wrestled with it for
nearly a minute longer . Then he said :

&quot; I suppose yer mother goes out washin &apos; ? &quot;

&quot; Yes . &quot;

&quot; &apos; N &apos; cleans offices ? &quot;

&quot; Yes . &quot;

&quot; So does mine . Any brothers &apos; n &apos; sisters ? &quot;

&quot; Two -- one brother &apos; n &apos; one sister . &quot;

Bill looked relieved -- for some reason .

&quot; I got nine , &quot; he said . &quot; Yours younger &apos;n you ? &quot;

&quot; Yes . &quot;

&quot; Lot of bother with the landlord ? &quot;

&quot; Yes , a good lot . &quot;

&quot; Had any bailiffs in yet ? &quot;

&quot; Yes , two . &quot;

They compared notes a while longer , and tailed off into a silence which
lasted three minutes and grew awkward towards the end .

Bill fidgeted about on the bench , reached round for a chip , but
recollected himself . Then he cocked his eye at the roof once more and
whistled , twirling a shaving round his fingers the while . At last
he tore the shaving in two , jerked it impatiently from him , and said
abruptly :

&quot; Look here , Arvie ! I &apos;m sorry I knocked over yer barrer yesterday . &quot;

&quot; Thank you . &quot;

This knocked Bill out the first round . He rubbed round uneasily on
the bench , fidgeted with the vise , drummed his fingers , whistled , and
finally thrust his hands in his pockets and dropped on his feet .

&quot; Look here , Arvie ! &quot; he said in low , hurried tones . &quot; Keep close to me
goin &apos; out to @-@ night , &apos; n &apos; if any of the other chaps touches yer or says
anything to yer I &apos;ll hit &apos; em ! &quot;

Then he swung himself round the corner of a carriage &quot; body &quot; and was
gone .

. . . . .

Arvie was late out of the shop that evening . His boss was a
sub @-@ contractor for the coach @-@ painting , and always tried to find twenty
minutes &apos; work for his boys just about five or ten minutes before the
bell rang . He employed boys because they were cheap and he had a lot of
rough work , and they could get under floors and &quot; bogies &quot; with their pots
and brushes , and do all the &quot; priming &quot; and paint the trucks . His name was
Collins , and the boys were called &quot; Collins &apos; Babies &quot; . It was a joke
in the shop that he had a &quot; weaning &quot; contract . The boys were all &quot; over
fourteen &quot; , of course , because of the Education Act . Some were nine or
ten -- wages from five shillings to ten shillings . It didn &apos;t matter
to Grinder Brothers so long as the contracts were completed and the
dividends paid . Collins preached in the park every Sunday . But this has
nothing to do with the story .

When Arvie came out it was beginning to rain and the hands had all gone
except Bill , who stood with his back to a verandah @-@ post , spitting with
very fair success at the ragged toe of one boot . He looked up , nodded
carelessly at Arvie , and then made a dive for a passing lorry , on the
end of which he disappeared round the next corner , unsuspected by the
driver , who sat in front with his pipe in his mouth and a bag over his
shoulders .

Arvie started home with his heart and mind pretty full , and a stronger ,
stranger aversion to ever going back to the shop again . This new ,
unexpected , and unsought @-@ for friendship embarrassed the poor lonely
child . It wasn &apos;t welcome .

But he never went back . He got wet going home , and that night he was a
dying child . He had been ill all the time , and Collins was one &quot; baby &quot;
short next day .




The Selector &apos;s Daughter



I.

She rode slowly down the steep siding from the main road to a track in
the bed of the Long Gully , the old grey horse picking his way zig @-@ zag
fashion . She was about seventeen , slight in figure , and had a pretty
freckled face with a pathetically drooping mouth , and big sad brown
eyes . She wore a faded print dress , with an old black riding skirt drawn
over it , and her head was hidden in one of those ugly , old @-@ fashioned
white hoods , which , seen from the rear , always suggest an old woman .
She carried several parcels of groceries strapped to the front of the
dilapidated side @-@ saddle .

The track skirted a chain of rocky waterholes at the foot of the gully ,
and the girl glanced nervously at these ghastly , evil @-@ looking pools as
she passed them by . The sun had set , as far as Long Gully was concerned .
The old horse carefully followed a rough bridle track , which ran up the
gully now on one side of the watercourse and now on the other ; the gully
grew deeper and darker , and its sullen , scrub @-@ covered sides rose more
steeply as he progressed .

The girl glanced round frequently , as though afraid of someone following
her . Once she drew rein , and listened to some bush sound . &quot; Kangaroos , &quot;
she murmured ; it was only kangaroos . She crossed a dimmed little
clearing where a farm had been , and entered a thick scrub of box and
stringy @-@ bark saplings . Suddenly with a heavy thud , thud , an &quot; old man &quot;
kangaroo leapt the path in front , startling the girl fearfully , and went
up the siding towards the peak .

&quot; Oh , my God ! &quot; she gasped , with her hand on her heart .

She was very nervous this evening ; her heart was hurt now , and she held
her hand close to it , while tears started from her eyes and glistened in
the light of the moon , which was rising over the gap ahead .

&quot; Oh , if I could only go away from the bush ! &quot; she moaned .

The old horse plodded on , and now and then shook his head -- sadly , it
seemed -- as if he knew her troubles and was sorry .

She passed another clearing , and presently came to a small homestead in
a stringy @-@ bark hollow below a great gap in the ridges -- &quot; Deadman &apos;s
Gap &quot; . The place was called &quot; Deadman &apos;s Hollow &quot; , and looked like it .
The &quot; house &quot; -- a low , two @-@ roomed affair , with skillions -- was built of
half @-@ round slabs and stringy @-@ bark , and was nearly all roof ; the bark ,
being darkened from recent rain , gave it a drearier appearance than
usual .

A big , coarse @-@ looking youth of about twenty was nailing a green kangaroo
skin to the slabs ; he was out of temper because he had bruised his
thumb . The girl unstrapped the parcels and carried them in ; as she
passed her brother , she said :

&quot; Take the saddle off for me , will you , Jack ? &quot;

&quot; Oh , carnt yer take it off yerself ? &quot; he snarled ; &quot; carnt yer see I &apos;m
busy ? &quot;

She took off the saddle and bridle , and carried them into a shed , where
she hung them on a beam . The patient old hack shook himself with an
energy that seemed ill @-@ advised , considering his age and condition , and
went off towards the &quot; dam &quot; .

An old woman sat in the main room beside a fireplace which took up
almost the entire end of the house . A plank @-@ table , supported on stakes
driven into the ground , stood in the middle of the room , and two slab
benches were fixtures on each side . The floor was clay . All was clean
and poverty @-@ stricken ; all that could be whitewashed was white , and
everything that could be washed was scrubbed . The slab shelves were
covered with clean newspapers , on which bright tins , and pannikins , and
fragments of crockery were set to the greatest advantage . The walls ,
however , were disfigured by Christmas supplements of illustrated
journals .

The girl came in and sat down wearily on a stool opposite to the old
woman .

&quot; Are you any better , mother ? &quot; she asked .

&quot; Very little , Mary , very little . Have you seen your father ? &quot;

&quot; No . &quot;

&quot; I wonder where he is ? &quot;

&quot; You might wonder . What &apos;s the use of worrying about it , mother ? &quot;

&quot; I suppose he &apos;s drinking again . &quot;

&quot; Most likely . Worrying yourself to death won &apos;t help it ! &quot;

The old woman sat and moaned about her troubles , as old women do . She
had plenty to moan about .

&quot; I wonder where your brother Tom is ? We haven &apos;t heard from him for a
year now . He must be in trouble again ; something tells me he must be in
trouble again . &quot;

Mary swung her hood off into her lap .

&quot; Why do you worry about it , mother ? What &apos;s the use ? &quot;

&quot; I only wish I knew . I only wish I knew ! &quot;

&quot; What good would that do ? You know Tom went droving with Fred Dunn , and
Fred will look after him ; and , besides , Tom &apos;s older now and got more
sense . &quot;

&quot; Oh , you don &apos;t care -- you don &apos;t care ! You don &apos;t feel it , but I &apos;m his
mother , and -- -- &quot;

&quot; Oh , for God &apos;s sake , don &apos;t start that again , mother ; it hurts me more
than you think . I &apos;m his sister ; I &apos;ve suffered enough , God knows ! Don &apos;t
make matters worse than they are ! &quot;

&quot; Here comes father ! &quot; shouted one of the children outside , &quot; &apos; n &apos; he &apos;s
bringing home a steer . &quot;

The old woman sat still , and clasped her hands nervously . Mary tried to
look cheerful , and moved the saucepan on the fire . A big , dark @-@ bearded
man , mounted on a small horse , was seen in the twilight driving a steer
towards the cow @-@ yard . A boy ran to let down the slip @-@ rails .

Presently Mary and her mother heard the clatter of rails let down and
put up again , and a minute later a heavy step like the tread of a horse
was heard outside . The selector lumbered in , threw his hat in a
corner , and sat down by the table . His wife rose and bustled round with
simulated cheerfulness . Presently Mary hazarded --

&quot; Where have you been , father ? &quot;

&quot; Somewheers . &quot;

There was a wretched silence , lasting until the old woman took courage
to say timidly :

&quot; So you &apos;ve brought a steer , Wylie ? &quot;

&quot; Yes ! &quot; he snapped ; the tone seemed defiant .

The old woman &apos;s hands trembled , so that she dropped a cup . Mary turned a
shade paler .

&quot; Here , git me some tea . Git me some TEA ! &quot; shouted Mr. Wylie . &quot; I ain &apos;t
agoin &apos; to sit here all night ! &quot;

His wife made what haste her nervousness would allow , and they soon sat
down to tea . Jack , the eldest son , was sulky , and his father muttered
something about knocking the sulks out of him with an axe .

&quot; What &apos;s annoyed you , Jack ? &quot; asked his mother , humbly .

He scowled and made no answer .

The younger children -- three boys and a girl -- began quarrelling as soon
as they sat down . Wylie yelled at them now and then , and grumbled at the
cooking , and at his wife for not being able to keep the children quiet .
It was : &quot; Marther ! you didn &apos;t put no sugar in my tea . &quot; &quot; Mother , Jimmy &apos;s
got my place ; make him move . &quot; &quot; Mawther ! do speak to this Fred . &quot; &quot; Oh !
father , this big brute of a Harry &apos;s kickin &apos; me ! &quot; And so on .


II .

When the miserable meal was over , Wylie got a rope and a butcher &apos;s
knife , and went out to slaughter the steer ; but first there was a row ,
because he thought -- or pretended to think -- that somebody had been
using his knife . He lassoed the beast , drew it up to the rails , and
slaughtered it .

Meanwhile , Jack and his next brother took an old gun , let the dogs
loose , and went &apos; possum shooting .

Presently Wylie came in again , sat down by the fire , and smoked . The
children quarrelled over a boy &apos;s book ; Mrs. Wylie made weak attempts
to keep the peace , but they took no notice of her . Suddenly her husband
rose with an oath , seized the novel , and threw it behind the fire .

&quot; Git to bed ! git to bed ! &quot; he roared at the children ; &quot; git to bed , or
I &apos;ll smash your brains with the axe ! &quot;

They got to bed . It was made of saplings and bark , covered with three
bushel @-@ bags full of straw and old pieces of blanket sewn together . The
children quarrelled in bed till their father took off his belt and &quot; went
into &quot; them , according to promise . There was a sudden hush , followed by
a sound like a bird @-@ clapper ; then howls ; then a peaceful calm fell upon
that happy home .

Wylie went out again , and was absent an hour ; on his return he sat by
the fire and smoked sullenly . After a while he snatched the pipe from
his mouth , and looked impatiently at the old woman .

&quot; Oh ! for God &apos;s sake , git to bed , &quot; he snapped , &quot; and don &apos;t be asittin&apos;
there like a blarsted funeral ! You &apos;re enough to give a man the dismals . &quot;

Mrs. Wylie gathered up her sewing and retired . Then he said to his
daughter : &quot; You come and hold the candle . &quot;

Mary put on her hood and followed her father to the yard . The carcase
lay close to the rails , against which two sheets of bark had been raised
as a break @-@ wind . The beast had been partly skinned , and a portion of
the hide , where a brand might have been , was carefully turned back . Mary
noticed this at once . Her father went on with his work , and occasionally
grumbled at her for not holding the candle right .

&quot; Where did you buy the steer , father ? &quot; she asked .

&quot; Ask no questions and hear no lies . &quot; Then he added , &quot; Carn &apos;t you see it &apos;s
a clear skin ? &quot;

She had a keen sense of humour , and the idea of a &quot; &apos; clear skin &apos; steer &quot;
would have amused her at any other time . She didn &apos;t smile now .

He turned the carcase over ; the loose hide fell back , and the light
shone on a distinct brand . White as a sheet went Mary &apos;s face , and her
hand trembled so that she nearly let the candle fall .

&quot; What are you adoin &apos; of now ? &quot; shouted her father . &quot; Hold the candle ,
carn &apos;t you ? You &apos;re worse than the old woman . &quot;

&quot; Father ! the beast is branded ! See ! -- -- What does PB stand for ? &quot;

&quot; Poor Beggar , like myself . Hold the candle , carn &apos;t you ? -- and hold your
tongue . &quot;

Mary was startled again by hearing the tread of a horse , but it was only
the old grey munching round . Her father finished skinning , and drew the
carcase up to a make @-@ shift &quot; gallows &quot; . &quot; Now you can go to bed , &quot; he said ,
in a gentler tone .

She went to her bedroom -- a small , low , slab skillion , built on to the
end of the house -- and fell on her knees by the bunk .

&quot; God help me ! God help us all ! &quot; she cried .

She lay down , but could not sleep . She was nervously ill -- nearly mad ,
because of the dark , disgraceful cloud of trouble which hung over her
home . Always in trouble -- always in trouble . It started long ago , when
her favourite brother Tom ran away . She was little more than a child
then , intensely sensitive ; and when she sat in the old bark school she
fancied that the other children were thinking or whispering to each
other , &quot; Her brother &apos;s in prison ! Mary Wylie &apos;s brother &apos;s in prison ! Tom
Wylie &apos;s in gaol ! &quot; She was thinking of it still . They were ever with her ,
those horrible days and nights of the first shadow of shame . She had the
same horror of evil , the same fearful dread of disgrace that her mother
had . She had been ambitious ; she had managed to read much , and had wild
dreams of going to the city and rising above the common level , but that
was all past now .

How could she rise when the cruel hand of disgrace was ever ready to
drag her down at any moment . &quot; Ah , God ! &quot; she moaned in her misery , &quot; if
we could only be born without kin -- with no one to disgrace us but
ourselves ! It &apos;s cruel , God , it &apos;s cruel to suffer for the crimes of
others ! &quot; She was getting selfish in her troubles -- like her mother . &quot; I
want to go away from the bush and all I know .... O God , help me to
go away from the bush ! &quot; Presently she fell asleep -- if sleep it may be
called -- and dreamt of sailing away , sailing away far out on the sea
beyond the horizon of her dread . Then came a horrible nightmare , in
which she and all her family were arrested for a terrible crime . She
woke in a fright , and saw a reddish glare on the window . Her father
was poking round some logs where they had been &quot; burning @-@ off &quot; . A pungent
odour came through a broken pane and turned her sick . He was burning the
hide .


Wylie did not go to bed that night ; he got his breakfast before
daylight , and rode up through the frosty gap while the stars were still
out , carrying a bag of beef in front of him on the grey horse . Mary said
nothing about the previous night . Her mother wondered how much &quot; father &quot;
had given for the steer , and supposed he had gone into town to sell
the hide ; the poor soul tried to believe that he had come by the steer
honestly . Mary fried some meat , and tried to eat it for her mother &apos;s
sake , but could manage only a few mouthfuls . Mrs. Wylie also seemed
to have lost her appetite . Jack and his brother , who had been out
all night , made a hearty breakfast . Then Jimmy started to peg out the
&apos;possum skins , while Jack went to look for a missing pony . Mary was left
to milk all the cows , and feed the calves and pigs .


Shortly after dinner one of the children ran to the door , and cried :

&quot; Why , mother -- here &apos;s three mounted troopers comin &apos; up the gully ! &quot;

&quot; Oh , my God ! &quot; cried the mother , sinking back in her chair and trembling
like a leaf . The children ran and hid in the scrub . Mary stood up ,
terribly calm , and waited . The eldest trooper dismounted , came to the
door , glanced suspiciously at the remains of the meal , and abruptly
asked the dreaded question :

&quot; Mrs. Wylie , where &apos;s your husband ? &quot;

She dropped the tea @-@ cup , from which she had pretended to be drinking
unconcernedly .

&quot; What ? Why , what do you want my husband for ? &quot; she asked in pitiful
desperation . SHE looked like the guilty party .

&quot; Oh , you know well enough , &quot; he sneered impatiently .

Mary rose and faced him . &quot; How dare you talk to my mother like that ? &quot; she
cried . &quot; If my poor brother Tom was only here -- you -- you coward ! &quot;

The youngest trooper whispered something to his senior , and then , stung
by a sharp retort , said :

&quot; Well , you needn &apos;t be a pig . &quot;

His two companions passed through into the spare skillion , where they
found some beef in a cask , and more already salted down under a bag on
the end of a bench ; then they went out at the back and had a look at the
cow @-@ yard . The younger trooper lingered behind .

&quot; I &apos;ll try and get them up the gully on some excuse , &quot; he whispered to
Mary . &quot; You plant the hide before we come back . &quot;

&quot; It &apos;s too late . Look there ! &quot; She pointed through the doorway .

The other two were at the logs where the fire had been ; the burning hide
had stuck to the logs in places like glue .

&quot; Wylie &apos;s a fool , &quot; remarked the old trooper .


III .

Jack disappeared shortly after his father &apos;s arrest on a charge of horse
and cattle @-@ stealing , and Tom , the prodigal , turned up unexpectedly .
He was different from his father and eldest brother . He had an open
good @-@ humoured face , and was very kind @-@ hearted ; but was subject to
peculiar fits of insanity , during which he did wild and foolish things
for the mere love of notoriety . He had two natures -- one bright and
good , the other sullen and criminal . A taint of madness ran in the
family -- came down from drunken and unprincipled fathers of dead
generations ; under different conditions , it might have developed into
genius in one or two -- in Mary , perhaps .

&quot; Cheer up , old woman ! &quot; cried Tom , patting his mother on the back . &quot; We &apos;ll
be happy yet . I &apos;ve been wild and foolish , I know , and gave you some
awful trouble , but that &apos;s all done with . I mean to keep steady , and
by @-@ and @-@ bye we &apos;ll go away to Sydney or Queensland . Give us a smile ,
mother . &quot;

He got some &quot; grubbing &quot; to do , and for six months kept the family
in provisions . Then a change came over him . He became moody and
sullen -- even brutal . He would sit for hours and grin to himself without
any apparent cause ; then he would stay away from home for days together .

&quot; Tom &apos;s going wrong again , &quot; wailed Mrs. Wylie . &quot; He &apos;ll get into trouble
again , I know he will . We are disgraced enough already , God knows . &quot;

&quot; You &apos;ve done your best , mother , &quot; said Mary , &quot; and can do no more .
People will pity us ; after all , the thing itself is not so bad as the
everlasting dread of it . This will be a lesson for father -- he wanted
one -- and maybe he &apos;ll be a better man . &quot; ( She knew better than that . ) &quot; YOU
did your best , mother . &quot;

&quot; Ah , Mary ! you don &apos;t know what I &apos;ve gone through these thirty years
in the bush with your father . I &apos;ve had to go down on my knees and beg
people not to prosecute him -- and the same with your brother Tom ; and
this is the end of it . &quot;

&quot; Better to have let them go , mother ; you should have left father when
you found out what sort of a man he was ; it would have been better for
all . &quot;

&quot; It was my duty to stick by him , child ; he was my husband . Your father
was always a bad man , Mary -- a bad man ; I found it out too late . I could
not tell you a quarter of what I have suffered with him .... I was proud ,
Mary ; I wanted my children to be better than others .... It &apos;s my fault ;
it &apos;s a judgment .... I wanted to make my children better than others ....
I was so proud , Mary . &quot;

Mary had a sweetheart , a drover , who was supposed to be in Queensland .
He had promised to marry her , and take her and her mother away when he
returned ; at least , she had promised to marry him on that condition . He
had now been absent on his latest trip for nearly six months , and there
was no news from him . She got a copy of a country paper to look for the
&quot; stock passings &quot; ; but a startling headline caught her eye :


IMPUDENT ATTEMPT AT ROBBERY UNDER ARMS .
-- --
&quot; A drover known to the police as Frederick Dunn , alias Drew ,
was arrested last week at -- -- &quot;


She read to the bitter end , and burned the paper . And the shadow of
another trouble , darker and drearier than all the rest , was upon her .

So the little outcast family in Long Gully existed for several months ,
seeing no one save a sympathetic old splitter who would come and smoke
his pipe by the fire of nights , and try to convince the old woman that
matters might have been worse , and that she wouldn &apos;t worry so much if
she knew the troubles of some of our biggest families , and that things
would come out all right and the lesson would do Wylie good . Also , that
Tom was a different boy altogether , and had more sense than to go
wrong again . &quot; It was nothing , &quot; he said , &quot; nothing ; they didn &apos;t know what
trouble was . &quot;

But one day , when Mary and her mother were alone , the troopers came
again .

&quot; Mrs. Wylie , where &apos;s your son Tom ? &quot; they asked .

She sat still . She didn &apos;t even cry , &quot; Oh , my God ! &quot;

&quot; Don &apos;t be frightened , Mrs. Wylie , &quot; said one of the troopers , gently . &quot; It
ain &apos;t for much anyway , and maybe Tom &apos;ll be able to clear himself . &quot;

Mary sank on her knees by her mother &apos;s side , crying &quot; Speak to me ,
mother . Oh , my God , she &apos;s dying ! Speak for my sake , mother . Don &apos;t die ,
mother ; it &apos;s all a mistake . Don &apos;t die and leave me here alone . &quot;

But the poor old woman was dead .

. . . . .

Wylie came out towards the end of the year , and a few weeks later he
brought home a -- another woman .


IV .

Bob Bentley , general hawker , was camping under some rocks by the main
road , near the foot of Long Gully . His mate was fast asleep under the
tilted trap . Bob stood with his back to the fire , his pipe in his mouth ,
and his hands clasped behind him . The fire lit up the undersides of the
branches above ; a native bear sat in a fork blinking down at it , while
the moon above him showed every hair on his ears . From among the trees
came the pleasant jingle of hobble @-@ chains , the slow tread of hoofs , and
the &quot; crunch , crunch &quot; at the grass , as the horses moved about and grazed ,
now in moonlight , now in the soft shadows . &quot; Old Thunder &quot; , a big black
dog of no particular breed , gave a meaning look at his master , and
started up the ridge , followed by several smaller dogs . Soon Bob heard
from the hillside the &quot; hy @-@ yi @-@ hi , whomp , whomp , whomp ! &quot; of old Thunder ,
and the yop @-@ yop @-@ yopping of the smaller fry -- they had tree &apos;d a &apos; possum .
Bob threw himself on the grass , and pretended to be asleep . There was
a sound as of a sizeable boulder rolling down the hill , and presently
Thunder trotted round the fire to see if his master would come . Bob
snored . The dog looked suspiciously at him , trotted round once or twice ,
and as a last resource gave him two great slobbery licks across the
face . Bob got up with a good @-@ natured oath .

&quot; Well , old party , &quot; he said to Thunder , &quot; you &apos;re a thundering old
nuisance ; but I s &apos;pose you won &apos;t be satisfied till I come . &quot; He got a gun
from the waggonette , loaded it , and started up the ridge ; old Thunder
rushing to and fro to show the way -- as if the row the other dogs were
making wasn &apos;t enough to guide his master .

When Bob returned with the &apos; possums he was startled to see a woman in
the camp . She was sitting on a log by the fire , with her elbows on her
knees and her face in her hands .

&quot; Why -- what the dev -- who are you ? &quot;

The girl raised a white desperate face to him . It was Mary Wylie .

&quot; My father and -- and the woman -- they &apos;re drinking -- they turned me out !
they turned me out . &quot;

&quot; Did they now ? I &apos;m sorry for that . What can I do for you ? ... She &apos;s mad
sure enough , &quot; he thought to himself ; &quot; I thought it was a ghost . &quot;

&quot; I don &apos;t know , &quot; she wailed , &quot; I don &apos;t know . You &apos;re a man , and I &apos;m a
helpless girl . They turned me out ! My mother &apos;s dead , and my brothers
gone away . Look ! Look here ! &quot; pointing to a bruise on her forehead . &quot; The
woman did that . My own father stood by and saw it done -- said it served
me right ! Oh , my God ! &quot;

&quot; What woman ? Tell me all about it . &quot;

&quot; The woman father brought home ! ... I want to go away from the bush ! Oh !
for God &apos;s sake take me away from the bush ! ... Anything ! anything ! -- you
know ! -- only take me away from the bush ! &quot;

Bob and his mate -- who had been roused -- did their best to soothe her ;
but suddenly , without a moment &apos;s warning , she sprang to her feet and
scrambled to the top of the rock overhanging the camp . She stood for a
moment in the bright moonlight , gazing intently down the vacant road .

&quot; Here they come ! &quot; she cried , pointing down the road . &quot; Here they
come -- the troopers ! I can see their cap @-@ peaks glistening in
the moonlight ! ... I &apos;m going away ! Mother &apos;s gone . I &apos;m going
now ! -- Good @-@ bye ! -- Good @-@ bye ! I &apos;m going away from the bush ! &quot;

Then she ran through the trees towards the foot of Long Gully . Bob and
his mate followed ; but , being unacquainted with the locality , they lost
her .

She ran to the edge of a granite cliff on the higher side of the deepest
of the rocky waterholes . There was a heavy splash , and three startled
kangaroos , who had been drinking , leapt back and sped away , like three
grey ghosts , up the ridge towards the moonlit peak .




Mitchell on the &quot; Sex &quot; and Other &quot; Problems &quot;



&quot; I agree with &apos; T &apos; in last week &apos;s &apos; Bulletin &apos; , &quot; said Mitchell , after
cogitating some time over the last drop of tea in his pannikin , held
at various angles , &quot; about what they call the &apos; Sex Problem &apos; . There &apos;s no
problem , really , except Creation , and that &apos;s not our affair ; we can &apos;t
solve it , and we &apos;ve no right to make a problem out of it for ourselves
to puzzle over , and waste the little time that is given us about . It &apos;s
we that make the problems , not Creation . We make &apos; em , and they only
smother us ; they &apos;ll smother the world in the end if we don &apos;t look
out . Anything that can be argued , for and against , from half a dozen
different points of view -- and most things that men argue over can
be -- and anything that has been argued about for thousands of years ( as
most things have ) is worse than profitless ; it wastes the world &apos;s time
and ours , and often wrecks old mateships . Seems to me the deeper you
read , think , talk , or write about things that end in ism , the less
satisfactory the result ; the more likely you are to get bushed and
dissatisfied with the world . And the more you keep on the surface of
plain things , the plainer the sailing -- the more comfortable for you and
everybody else . We &apos;ve always got to come to the surface to breathe , in
the end , in any case ; we &apos;re meant to live on the surface , and we might
as well stay there and look after it and ourselves for all the good we
do diving down after fish that aren &apos;t there , except in our imagination .
And some of &apos; em are very dead fish , too -- the &apos; Sex Problem &apos; , for
instance . When we fall off the surface of the earth it will be time
enough to make a problem out of the fact that we couldn &apos;t stick on . I &apos;m
a Federal Pro @-@ trader in this country ; I &apos;m a Federalist because I think
Federation is the plain and natural course for Australia , and I &apos;m a
Free @-@ tectionist because I &apos;m in favour of sinking any question , or any
two things , that enlightened people can argue and fight over , and try ,
one after the other , for fifty years without being able to come to a
decision about , or prove which is best for the welfare of the country .
It only wastes a young country &apos;s time , and keeps it off the right track .
Federation isn &apos;t a problem -- it &apos;s a plain fact -- but they make a problem
out of every panel they have to push down in the rotten old boundary
fences . &quot;

&quot; Personal interests , &quot; suggested Joe .

&quot; Of course . It &apos;s personal interest of the wrong sort that makes all the
problems . You can trace the sex problem to people who trade in unhealthy
personal interests . I believe in personal interests of the right
sort -- true individualism . If we all looked after ourselves , and our
wives and families -- if we have any -- in the proper way , the world would
be all right . We waste too much time looking after each other .

&quot; Now , supposing we &apos;re travelling and have to get a shed and make a
cheque so &apos;s to be able to send a few quid home , as soon as we can , to
the missus , or the old folks , and the next water is twenty miles ahead .
If we sat down and argued over a social problem till doomsday , we
wouldn &apos;t get to the tank ; we &apos;d die of thirst , and the missus and kids ,
or the old folks , would be sold up and turned out into the streets ,
and have to fall back on a &apos; home of hope &apos; , or wait their turn at the
Benevolent Asylum with bags for broken victuals . I &apos;ve seen that , and I
don &apos;t want anybody belonging to me to have to do it .

&quot; Reminds me that when a poor , deserted girl goes to a &apos; home &apos; they don &apos;t
make a problem of her -- they do their best for her and try to get her
righted . And the priests , too : if there &apos;s anything in the sex or any
other problem -- anything that hasn &apos;t been threshed out -- they &apos;re the men
that &apos;ll know it . I &apos;m not a Catholic , but I know this : that if a girl
that &apos;s been left by one -- no matter what Church she belongs to -- goes to
the priest , they &apos;ll work all the points they know ( and they know &apos; em
all ) to get her righted , and , if the chap , or his people , won &apos;t come up
to the scratch , Father Ryan &apos;ll frighten hell out of &apos; em . I can &apos;t say as
much for our own Churches . &quot;

&quot; But you &apos;re in favour of socialism and democracy ? &quot; asked Joe .

&quot; Of course I am . But the world won &apos;t do any good arguing over it .
The people will have to get up and walk , and , what &apos;s more , stick
together -- and I don &apos;t think they &apos;ll ever do that -- it ain &apos;t in human
nature . Socialism , or democracy , was all right in this country till
it got fashionable and was made a fad or a problem of . Then it got
smothered pretty quick . And a fad or a problem always breeds a host of
parasites or hangers @-@ on . Why , as soon as I saw the advanced idealist
fools -- they &apos;re generally the middle @-@ class , shabby @-@ genteel families that
catch Spiritualism and Theosophy and those sort of complaints , at the
end of the epidemic -- that catch on at the tail @-@ end of things and think
they &apos;ve caught something brand , shining , new ; -- as soon as I saw them ,
and the problem spielers and notoriety @-@ hunters of both sexes , beginning
to hang round Australian Unionism , I knew it was doomed . And so it was .
The straight men were disgusted , or driven out . There are women who hang
on for the same reason that a girl will sometimes go into the dock and
swear an innocent man &apos;s life away . But as soon as they see that the
cause is dying , they drop it at once , and wait for another . They come
like bloody dingoes round a calf , and only leave the bones . They &apos;re
about as democratic as the crows . And the rotten &apos; sex @-@ problem &apos; sort of
thing is the cause of it all ; it poisons weak minds -- and strong ones too
sometimes .

&quot; Why , you could make a problem out of Epsom salts . You might argue as to
why human beings want Epsom salts , and try to trace the causes that
led up to it . I don &apos;t like the taste of Epsom salts -- it &apos;s nasty in
the mouth -- but when I feel that way I take &apos; em , and I feel better
afterwards ; and that &apos;s good enough for me . We might argue that black is
white , and white is black , and neither of &apos; em is anything , and nothing
is everything ; and a woman &apos;s a man and a man &apos;s a woman , and it &apos;s really
the man that has the youngsters , only we imagine it &apos;s the woman because
she imagines that she has all the pain and trouble , and the doctor is
under the impression that he &apos;s attending to her , not the man , and the
man thinks so too because he imagines he &apos;s walking up and down outside ,
and slipping into the corner pub now and then for a nip to keep his
courage up , waiting , when it &apos;s his wife that &apos;s doing that all the time ;
we might argue that it &apos;s all force of imagination , and that imagination
is an unknown force , and that the unknown is nothing . But , when we &apos;ve
settled all that to our own satisfaction , how much further ahead are we ?
In the end we &apos;ll come to the conclusion that we ain &apos;t alive , and never
existed , and then we &apos;ll leave off bothering , and the world will go on
just the same . &quot;

&quot; What about science ? &quot; asked Joe .

&quot; Science ain &apos;t &apos; sex problems &apos; ; it &apos;s facts .... Now , I don &apos;t mind
Spiritualism and those sort of things ; they might help to break the
monotony , and can &apos;t do much harm . But the &apos; sex problem &apos; , as it &apos;s written
about to @-@ day , does ; it &apos;s dangerous and dirty , and it &apos;s time to settle it
with a club . Science and education , if left alone , will look after sex
facts .

&quot; You can &apos;t get anything out of the &apos; sex problem &apos; , no matter how you
argue . In the old Bible times they had half a dozen wives each , but we
don &apos;t know for certain how THEY got on . The Mormons tried it again , and
seemed to get on all right till we interfered . We don &apos;t seem to be able
to get on with one wife now -- at least , according to the &apos; sex problem &apos; .
The &apos; sex problem &apos; troubled the Turks so much that they tried three . Lots
of us try to settle it by knocking round promiscuously , and that leads
to actions for maintenance and breach of promise cases , and all sorts of
trouble . Our blacks settle the &apos; sex problem &apos; with a club , and so far I
haven &apos;t heard any complaints from them .

. . . . .

&quot; Take hereditary causes and surrounding circumstances , for instance . In
order to understand or judge a man right , you would need to live under
the same roof with him from childhood , and under the same roofs , or
tents , with his parents , right back to Adam , and then you &apos;d be blocked
for want of more ancestors through which to trace the causes that led
to Abel -- I mean Cain -- going on as he did . What &apos;s the use or sense of it ?
You might argue away in any direction for a million miles and a million
years back into the past , but you &apos;ve got to come back to where you are
if you wish to do any good for yourself , or anyone else .

&quot; Sometimes it takes you a long while to get back to where you
are -- sometimes you never do it . Why , when those controversies were
started in the &apos; Bulletin &apos; about the kangaroos and other things , I
thought I knew something about the bush . Now I &apos;m damned if I &apos;m sure I
could tell a kangaroo from a wombat .

&quot; Trying to find out things is the cause of all the work and trouble in
this world . It was Eve &apos;s fault in the first place -- or Adam &apos;s , rather ,
because it might be argued that he should have been master . Some men are
too lazy to be masters in their own homes , and run the show properly ;
some are too careless , and some too drunk most of their time , and some
too weak . If Adam and Eve hadn &apos;t tried to find out things there &apos;d have
been no toil and trouble in the world to @-@ day ; there &apos;d have been no
bloated capitalists , and no horny @-@ handed working men , and no politics ,
no freetrade and protection -- and no clothes . The woman next door
wouldn &apos;t be able to pick holes in your wife &apos;s washing on the line . We &apos;d
have been all running about in a big Garden of Eden with nothing on , and
nothing to do except loaf , and make love , and lark , and laugh , and play
practical jokes on each other . &quot;

Joe grinned .

&quot; That would have been glorious . Wouldn &apos;t it , Joe ? There &apos;d have been no
&apos;sex problem &apos; then . &quot;




The Master &apos;s Mistake



William Spencer stayed away from school that hot day , and &quot; went
swimming &quot; . The master wrote a note to William &apos;s father , and gave it to
William &apos;s brother Joe to carry home .

&quot; You &apos;ll give that to your father to @-@ night , Joseph . &quot;

&quot; Yes , sir . &quot;

Bill waited for Joe near the gap , and walked home with him .

&quot; I s &apos;pose you &apos;ve got a note for father . &quot;

&quot; Yes , &quot; said Joe .

&quot; I s &apos;pose you know what &apos;s in it ? &quot;

&quot; Ye -- yes . Oh , why did you stop away , Bill ? &quot;

&quot; You don &apos;t mean to say that you &apos;re dirty mean enough to give it to
father ? Hey ? &quot;

&quot; I must , Will . I promised the master . &quot;

&quot; He needn &apos;t never know . &quot;

&quot; Oh , yes , he will . He &apos;s coming over to our place on Saturday , and he &apos;s
sure to ask me to @-@ morrow . &quot;

Pause .

&quot; Look here , Joe ! &quot; said Bill , &quot; I don &apos;t want to get a hiding and go
without supper to @-@ night . I promised to go &apos; possuming with Johnny
Nowlett , and he &apos;s going to give me a fire out of his gun . You can come ,
too . I don &apos;t want to cop out on it to @-@ night -- if I do I &apos;ll run away from
home again , so there . &quot;

Bill walked on a bit in moody , Joe in troubled , silence .

Bill tried again : he threatened , argued , and pleaded , but Joe was firm .
&quot; The master trusted me , Will , &quot; he said .

&quot; Joe , &quot; said Bill at last , after a long pause , &quot; I wouldn &apos;t do it to you . &quot;

Joe was troubled .

&quot; I wouldn &apos;t do it to you , Joe . &quot;

Joe thought how Bill had stood up and fought for him only last week .

&quot; I &apos;d tear the note in bits ; I &apos;d tell a hundred lies ; I &apos;d take a dozen
hidings first , Joe -- I would . &quot;

Joe was greatly troubled . His chest heaved , and the tears came to his
eyes .

&quot; I &apos;d do more than that for you , Joe , and you know it . &quot;

Joe knew it . They were crossing the old goldfield now . There was a shaft
close to the path ; it had fallen in , funnel @-@ shaped , at the top , but was
still thirty or forty feet deep ; some old logs were jammed across about
five feet down . Joe suddenly snatched the note from his pocket and threw
it in . It fluttered to the other side and rested on a piece of the old
timber . Bill saw it , but said nothing , and , seeing their father coming
home from work , they hurried on .

Joe was deep in trouble now . Bill tried to comfort and cheer him , but it
was no use . Bill promised never to run away from home any more , to go
to school every day , and never to fight , or steal , or tell lies . But Joe
had betrayed his trust for the first time in his life , and wouldn &apos;t be
comforted .

Some time in the night Bill woke , and found Joe sitting up in bed
crying .

&quot; Why , what &apos;s the matter , Joe ? &quot;

&quot; I never done a mean thing like that before , &quot; sobbed Joe . &quot; I wished I &apos;d
chucked meself down the shaft instead . The master trusted me , Will ; an&apos;
now , if he asks me to @-@ morrow , I &apos;ll have to tell a lie . &quot;

&quot; Then tell the truth , Joe , an &apos; take the hidin &apos; ; it &apos;ll soon be over -- just
a couple of cuts with the cane and it &apos;ll be all over . &quot;

&quot; Oh , no , it won &apos;t . He won &apos;t never trust me any more . I &apos;ve never been
caned in that school yet , Will , and if I am I &apos;ll never go again . Oh ! why
will you run away from home , Will , and play the wag , and steal , and
get us all into such trouble ? You don &apos;t know how mother takes on about
it -- you don &apos;t know how it hurts father ! I &apos;ve deceived the master , and
mother and father to @-@ day , just because you &apos;re so -- so selfish , &quot; and he
laid down and cried himself to sleep .

Bill lay awake and thought till daylight ; then he got up quietly , put on
his clothes , and stole away from the house and across the flat , followed
by the dog , who thought it was a &apos; possum @-@ hunting expedition . Bill wished
the dog would not be quite so demonstrative , at least until they got
away from the house . He went straight to the shaft , let himself down
carefully on to one of the old logs , and stooped to pick up the note ,
gleaming white in the sickly summer daylight . Then the rotten timber
gave way suddenly , without a moment &apos;s warning .

. . . . .

They found him that morning at about nine o &apos;clock . The dog attracted
the attention of an old fossicker passing to his work . The letter was
gripped in Bill &apos;s right hand when they brought him up . They took him
home , and the father went for a doctor . Bill came to himself a little
just before the last , and said : &quot; Mother ! I wasn &apos;t running away ,
mother -- tell father that -- I -- I wanted to try and catch a &apos; possum on the
ground .... Where &apos;s Joe ? I want Joe . Go out , mother , a minute , and send
Joe . &quot;

&quot; Here I am , Bill , &quot; said Joe , in a choking , terrified voice .

&quot; Has the master been yet ? &quot;

&quot; No . &quot;

&quot; Bend down , Joe . I went for the note , and the logs gave way . I meant to
be back before they was up . I dropped it down inside the bed ; you watch
your chance and get it ; and say you forgot it last night -- say you
didn &apos;t like to give it -- that won &apos;t be a lie . Tell the master I &apos;m -- I &apos;m
sorry -- tell the master never to send no notes no more -- except by
girls -- that &apos;s all .... Mother ! Take the blankets off me -- I &apos;m dyin &apos; . &quot;




The Story of the Oracle



&quot; We young fellows , &quot; said &quot; Sympathy Joe &quot; to Mitchell , after tea , in
their first camp west the river -- &quot; and you and I ARE young fellows ,
comparatively -- think we know the world . There are plenty of young chaps
knocking round in this country who reckon they &apos;ve been through it
all before they &apos;re thirty . I &apos;ve met cynics and men @-@ o &apos; -the @-@ world , aged
twenty @-@ one or thereabouts , who &apos;ve never been further than a trip to
Sydney . They talk about &apos; this world &apos; as if they &apos;d knocked around in
half @-@ a @-@ dozen other worlds before they came across here -- and they are
just as off @-@ hand about it as older Australians are when they talk about
this colony as compared with the others . They say : &apos; My oath ! -- same
here . &apos; &apos; I &apos;ve been there . &apos; &apos; My oath ! -- you &apos;re right . &apos; &apos; Take it from me ! &apos;
and all that sort of thing . They understand women , and have a contempt
for &apos; em ; and chaps that don &apos;t talk as they talk , or do as they do , or
see as they see , are either soft or ratty . A good many reckon that &apos; life
ain &apos;t blanky well worth livin &apos; &apos; ; sometimes they feel so blanky somehow
that they wouldn &apos;t give a blank whether they chucked it or not ; but
that sort never chuck it . It &apos;s mostly the quiet men that do that , and
if they &apos;ve got any complaints to make against the world they make &apos; em at
the head station . Why , I &apos;ve known healthy , single , young fellows
under twenty @-@ five who drank to drown their troubles -- some because
they reckoned the world didn &apos;t understand nor appreciate &apos; em -- as if it
COULD ! &quot;

&quot; If the world don &apos;t understand or appreciate you , &quot; said Mitchell
solemnly , as he reached for a burning stick to light his pipe -- &quot; MAKE
it ! &quot;

&quot; To drown THEIR troubles ! &quot; continued Joe , in a tone of impatient
contempt . &quot; The Oracle must be well on towards the sixties ; he can take
his glass with any man , but you never saw him drunk . &quot;

&quot; What &apos;s the Oracle to do with it ? &quot;

&quot; Did you ever hear his history ? &quot;

&quot; No . Do you know it ? &quot;

&quot; Yes , though I don &apos;t think he has any idea that I do . Now , we were
talking about the Oracle a little while ago . We know he &apos;s an old ass ;
a good many outsiders consider that he &apos;s a bit soft or ratty , and ,
as we &apos;re likely to be mates together for some time on that fencing
contract , if we get it , you might as well know what sort of a man he is
and was , so &apos;s you won &apos;t get uneasy about him if he gets deaf for a while
when you &apos;re talking , or does funny things with his pipe or pint @-@ pot , or
walks up and down by himself for an hour or so after tea , or sits on a
log with his head in his hands , or leans on the fence in the gloaming
and keeps looking in a blank sort of way , straight ahead , across the
clearing . For he &apos;s gazing at something a thousand miles across country ,
south @-@ east , and about twenty years back into the past , and no doubt he
sees himself ( as a young man ) , and a Gippsland girl , spooning under the
stars along between the hop @-@ gardens and the Mitchell River . And , if you
get holt of a fiddle or a concertina , don &apos;t rasp or swank too much
on old tunes , when he &apos;s round , for the Oracle can &apos;t stand it . Play
something lively . He &apos;ll be down there at that surveyor &apos;s camp yarning
till all hours , so we &apos;ll have plenty of time for the story -- but don &apos;t
you ever give him a hint that you know .

&quot; My people knew him well ; I got most of the story from them -- mostly from
Uncle Bob , who knew him better than any . The rest leaked out through the
women -- you know how things leak out amongst women ? &quot;

Mitchell dropped his head and scratched the back of it . HE knew .

&quot; It was on the Cudgegong River . My Uncle Bob was mates with him on one
of those &apos; rushes &apos; along there -- the &apos; Pipeclay &apos; , I think it was , or the
&apos;Log Paddock &apos; . The Oracle was a young man then , of course , and so was
Uncle Bob ( he was a match for most men ) . You see the Oracle now , and you
can imagine what he was when he was a young man . Over six feet , and as
straight as a sapling , Uncle Bob said , clean @-@ limbed , and as fresh as
they made men in those days ; carried his hands behind him , as he does
now , when he hasn &apos;t got the swag -- but his shoulders were back in
those days . Of course he wasn &apos;t the Oracle then ; he was young Tom
Marshall -- but that doesn &apos;t matter . Everybody liked him -- especially women
and children . He was a bit happy @-@ go @-@ lucky and careless , but he didn &apos;t
know anything about &apos; this world &apos; , and didn &apos;t bother about it ; he hadn &apos;t
&apos;been there &apos; . &apos; And his heart was as good as gold , &apos; my aunt used to
say . He didn &apos;t understand women as we young fellows do nowadays , and
therefore he hadn &apos;t any contempt for &apos; em . Perhaps he understood , and
understands , them better than any of us , without knowing it . Anyway , you
know , he &apos;s always gentle and kind where a woman or child is concerned ,
and doesn &apos;t like to hear us talk about women as we do sometimes .

&quot; There was a girl on the goldfields -- a fine lump of a blonde , and pretty
gay . She came from Sydney , I think , with her people , who kept shanties
on the fields . She had a splendid voice , and used to sing &apos; Madeline &apos; .
There might have been one or two bad women before that , in the Oracle &apos;s
world , but no cold @-@ blooded , designing ones . He calls the bad ones
&apos;unfortunate &apos; .

&quot; Perhaps it was Tom &apos;s looks , or his freshness , or his innocence , or
softness -- or all together -- that attracted her . Anyway , he got mixed up
with her before the goldfield petered out .

&quot; No doubt it took a long while for the facts to work into Tom &apos;s head
that a girl might sing like she did and yet be thoroughly unprincipled .
The Oracle was always slow at coming to a decision , but when he does
it &apos;s generally the right one . Anyway , you can take that for granted , for
you won &apos;t move him .

&quot; I don &apos;t know whether he found out that she wasn &apos;t all that she
pretented to be to him , or whether they quarrelled , or whether she
chucked him over for a lucky digger . Tom never had any luck on the
goldfields . Anyway , he left and went over to the Victorian side , where
his people were , and went up Gippsland way . It was there for the first
time in his life that he got what you would call &apos; properly gone on a
girl &apos; ; he got hard hit -- he met his fate .

&quot; Her name was Bertha Bredt , I remember . Aunt Bob saw her afterwards .
Aunt Bob used to say that she was &apos; a girl as God made her &apos; -- a good ,
true , womanly girl -- one of those sort of girls that only love once . Tom
got on with her father , who was packing horses through the ranges to the
new goldfields -- it was rough country and there were no roads ; they had
to pack everything there in those days , and there was money in it . The
girl &apos;s father took to Tom -- as almost everybody else did -- and , as far as
the girl was concerned , I think it was a case of love at first sight .
They only knew each other for about six months , and were only &apos; courting&apos;
( as they called it then ) for three or four months altogether , but she
was that sort of girl that can love a man for six weeks and lose him for
ever , and yet go on loving him to the end of her life -- and die with his
name on her lips .

&quot; Well , things were brightening up every way for Tom , and he and his
sweetheart were beginning to talk about their own little home in future ,
when there came a letter from the &apos; Madeline &apos; girl in New South Wales .

&quot; She was in terrible trouble . Her baby was to be born in a month . Her
people had kicked her out , and she was in danger of starving . She begged
and prayed of him to come back and marry her , if only for his child &apos;s
sake . He could go then , and be free ; she would never trouble him any
more -- only come and marry her for the child &apos;s sake .

&quot; The Oracle doesn &apos;t know where he lost that letter , but I do . It was
burnt afterwards by a woman , who was more than a mother to him in his
trouble -- Aunt Bob . She thought he might carry it round with the rest of
his papers , in his swag , for years , and come across it unexpectedly when
he was camped by himself in the bush and feeling dull . It wouldn &apos;t have
done him any good then .

&quot; He must have fought the hardest fight in his life when he got that
letter . No doubt he walked to and fro , to and fro , all night , with his
hands behind him , and his eyes on the ground , as he does now sometimes .
Walking up and down helps you to fight a thing out .

&quot; No doubt he thought of things pretty well as he thinks now : the poor
girl &apos;s shame on every tongue , and belled round the district by every hag
in the township ; and she looked upon by women as being as bad as any
man who ever went to Bathurst in the old days , handcuffed between two
troopers . There is sympathy , a pipe and tobacco , a cheering word , and ,
maybe , a whisky now and then , for the criminal on his journey ; but
there is no mercy , at least as far as women are concerned , for the
poor foolish girl , who has to sneak out the back way and round by back
streets and lanes after dark , with a cloak on to hide her figure .

&quot; Tom sent what money he thought he could spare , and next day he went to
the girl he loved and who loved him , and told her the truth , and showed
her the letter . She was only a girl -- but the sort of girl you COULD go
to in a crisis like that . He had made up his mind to do the right thing ,
and she loved him all the more for it . And so they parted .

&quot; When Tom reached &apos; Pipeclay &apos; , the girl &apos;s relations , that she was
stopping with , had a parson readied up , and they were married the same
day . &quot;

&quot; And what happened after that ? &quot; asked Mitchell .

&quot; Nothing happened for three or four months ; then the child was born . It
wasn &apos;t his ! &quot;

Mitchell stood up with an oath .

&quot; The girl was thoroughly bad . She &apos;d been carrying on with God knows how
many men , both before and after she trapped Tom . &quot;

&quot; And what did he do then ? &quot;

&quot; Well , you know how the Oracle argues over things , and I suppose he was
as big an old fool then as he is now . He thinks that , as most men would
deceive women if they could , when one man gets caught , he &apos;s got no call
to squeal about it ; he &apos;s bound , because of the sins of men in general
against women , to make the best of it . What is one man &apos;s wrong counted
against the wrongs of hundreds of unfortunate girls .

&quot; It &apos;s an uncommon way of arguing -- like most of the Oracle &apos;s ideas -- but
it seems to look all right at first sight .

&quot; Perhaps he thought she &apos;d go straight ; perhaps she convinced him that he
was the cause of her first fall ; anyway he stuck to her for more than
a year , and intended to take her away from that place as soon as he &apos;d
scraped enough money together . It might have gone on up till now , if
the father of the child -- a big black Irishman named Redmond -- hadn &apos;t come
sneaking back at the end of a year . He -- well , he came hanging round Mrs.
Marshall while Tom was away at work -- and she encouraged him . And Tom was
forced to see it .

&quot; Tom wanted to fight out his own battle without interference , but the
chaps wouldn &apos;t let him -- they reckoned that he &apos;d stand very little show
against Redmond , who was a very rough customer and a fighting man . My
uncle Bob , who was there still , fixed it up this way : The Oracle was
to fight Redmond , and if the Oracle got licked Uncle Bob was to take
Redmond on . If Redmond whipped Uncle Bob , that was to settle it ; but if
Uncle Bob thrashed Redmond , then he was also to fight Redmond &apos;s
mate , another big , rough Paddy named Duigan . Then the affair would be
finished -- no matter which way the last bout went . You see , Uncle Bob was
reckoned more of a match for Redmond than the Oracle was , so the thing
looked fair enough -- at first sight .

&quot; Redmond had his mate , Duigan , and one or two others of the rough gang
that used to terrorise the fields round there in the roaring days of
Gulgong . The Oracle had Uncle Bob , of course , and long Dave Regan , the
drover -- a good @-@ hearted , sawny kind of chap that &apos;d break the devil &apos;s
own buck @-@ jumper , or smash him , or get smashed himself -- and little Jimmy
Nowlett , the bullocky , and one or two of the old , better @-@ class diggers
that were left on the field .

&quot; There &apos;s a clear space among the saplings in Specimen Gully , where they
used to pitch circuses ; and here , in the cool of a summer evening , the
two men stood face to face . Redmond was a rough , roaring , foul @-@ mouthed
man ; he stripped to his shirt , and roared like a bull , and swore , and
sneered , and wanted to take the whole of Tom &apos;s crowd while he was at it ,
and make one clean job of &apos; em . Couldn &apos;t waste time fighting them all one
after the other , because he wanted to get away to the new rush at Cattle
Creek next day . The fool had been drinking shanty @-@ whisky .

&quot; Tom stood up in his clean , white moles and white flannel shirt -- one of
those sort with no sleeves , that give the arms play . He had a sort
of set expression and a look in his eyes that Uncle Bob -- nor none of
them -- had ever seen there before . &apos; Give us plenty of -- -- room ! &apos; roared
Redmond ; &apos; one of us is going to hell , now ! This is going to be a fight
to a -- -- finish , and a -- -- short one ! &apos; And it was ! &quot; Joe paused .

&quot; Go on , &quot; said Mitchell -- &quot; go on ! &quot;

Joe drew a long breath .

&quot; The Oracle never got a mark ! He was top @-@ dog right from the start .
Perhaps it was his strength that Redmond had underrated , or his want
of science that puzzled him , or the awful silence of the man that
frightened him ( it made even Uncle Bob uneasy ) . Or , perhaps , it was
Providence ( it was a glorious chance for Providence ) , but , anyway , as
I say , the Oracle never got a mark , except on his knuckles . After a few
rounds Redmond funked and wanted to give in , but the chaps wouldn &apos;t let
him -- not even his own mates -- except Duigan . They made him take it as
long as he could stand on his feet . He even shammed to be knocked out ,
and roared out something about having broken his -- -- ankle -- but it was
no use . And the Oracle ! The chaps that knew thought that he &apos;d refuse to
fight , and never hit a man that had given in . But he did . He just stood
there with that quiet look in his eyes and waited , and , when he did hit ,
there wasn &apos;t any necessity for Redmond to PRETEND to be knocked down .
You &apos;ll see a glint of that old light in the Oracle &apos;s eyes even now , once
in a while ; and when you do it &apos;s a sign that you or someone are going
too far , and had better pull up , for it &apos;s a red light on the line , old
as he is .

&quot; Now , Jimmy Nowlett was a nuggety little fellow , hard as cast iron ,
good @-@ hearted , but very excitable ; and when the bashed Redmond was
being carted off ( poor Uncle Bob was always pretty high @-@ strung , and was
sitting on a log sobbing like a great child from the reaction ) , Duigan
made some sneering remark that only Jimmy Nowlett caught , and in an
instant he was up and at Duigan .

&quot; Perhaps Duigan was demoralised by his mate &apos;s defeat , or by the
suddenness of the attack ; but , at all events , he got a hiding , too .
Uncle Bob used to say that it was the funniest thing he ever saw in his
life . Jimmy kept yelling : &apos; Let me get at him ! By the Lord , let me get at
him ! &apos; And nobody was attempting to stop him , he WAS getting at him all
the time -- and properly , too ; and , when he &apos;d knocked Duigan down , he &apos;d
dance round him and call on him to get up ; and every time he jumped or
bounced , he &apos;d squeak like an india @-@ rubber ball , Uncle Bob said , and he
would nearly burst his boiler trying to lug the big man on to his feet
so &apos;s he could knock him down again . It took two of Jimmy &apos;s mates all
their time to lam him down into a comparatively reasonable state of mind
after the fight was over .

&quot; The Oracle left for Sydney next day , and Uncle Bob went with him . He
stayed at Uncle Bob &apos;s place for some time . He got very quiet , they said ,
and gentle ; he used to play with the children , and they got mighty fond
of him . The old folks thought his heart was broken , but it went through
a deeper sorrow still after that and it ain &apos;t broken yet . It takes a lot
to break the heart of a man . &quot;

&quot; And his wife , &quot; asked Mitchell -- &quot; what became of her ? &quot;

&quot; I don &apos;t think he ever saw her again . She dropped down pretty low after
he left her -- I &apos;ve heard she &apos;s living somewhere quietly . The Oracle &apos;s
been sending someone money ever since I knew him , and I know it &apos;s a
woman . I suppose it &apos;s she . He isn &apos;t the sort of a man to see a woman
starve -- especially a woman he had ever had anything to do with . &quot;

&quot; And the Gippsland girl ? &quot; asked Mitchell .

&quot; That &apos;s the worst part of it all , I think . The Oracle went up North
somewhere . In the course of a year or two his affair got over Gippsland
way through a mate of his who lived over there , and at last the story
got to the ears of this girl , Bertha Bredt . She must have written a
dozen letters to him , Aunt Bob said . She knew what was in &apos; em , but , of
course , she &apos;d never tell us . The Oracle only wrote one in reply . Then ,
what must the girl do but clear out from home and make her way over to
Sydney -- to Aunt Bob &apos;s place , looking for Tom . She never got any further .
She took ill -- brain @-@ fever , or broken heart , or something of that sort .
All the time she was down her cry was -- &apos; I want to see him ! I want to
find Tom ! I only want to see Tom ! &apos;

&quot; When they saw she was dying , Aunt Bob wired to the Oracle to come -- and
he came . When the girl saw it was Tom sitting by the bed , she just gave
one long look in his face , put her arms round his neck , and laid her
head on his shoulder -- and died .... Here comes the Oracle now . &quot;

Mitchell lifted the tea @-@ billy on to the coals .

stories , but biting into the very heart of the bushman &apos;s life , ruthless
in truth , extraordinarily dramatic , and pathetically uneven .... &quot;

The Times : &quot; A collection of short and vigorous studies and stories of
Australian life and character . A little in Bret Harte &apos;s manner , crossed ,
perhaps , with that of Guy de Maupassant . &quot;



&#91; The Announcements at the end of this section give alternate titles
for two of Lawson &apos;s works , to wit : &quot; On the Track &quot; is given as such , but
&quot; Over the Sliprails &quot; is given as &quot; By the Sliprails &quot; , and the combined
work &quot; On the Track and Over the Sliprails &quot; is given as &quot; By Track and
Sliprails &quot; . Of course , only &quot; On the Track &quot; had actually been printed at
the date of the advertisement , so it might be theorized that these had
been working titles , afterwards discarded , whose inclusion here was
overlooked . -- A. L. , 1998 . &#93;





About the author :



Henry Lawson was born near Grenfell , New South Wales , Australia on
17 June 1867 . Although he has since become Australia &apos;s most acclaimed
writer , in his own lifetime his writing was often &quot; on the side &quot; -- his
&quot; real &quot; work being whatever he could find . His writing was frequently
taken from memories of his childhood , especially at Pipeclay / Eurunderee .
In his autobiography , he states that many of his characters were
taken from the better class of diggers and bushmen he knew there .
His experiences at this time deeply influenced his work , for it is
interesting to note a number of descriptions and phrases that are
identical in his autobiography and in his stories and poems . He died at
Sydney , 2 September 1922 . He is most famous for his short stories .

&quot; On the Track &quot; and &quot; Over the Sliprails &quot; were both published at Sydney
in 1900 , the prefaces being dated March and June respectively -- and so ,
though printed separately , a combined edition was printed the same
year ( the two separate , complete works were simply put together in one
binding ) ; hence they are sometimes referred to as &quot; On the Track and Over
the Sliprails &quot; . The opposite occurred with &quot; Joe Wilson and His Mates &quot; ,
which was later divided into &quot; Joe Wilson &quot; and &quot; Joe Wilson &apos;s Mates &quot;
( 1901 ) . All of these works are now online , as well as one book of
Lawson &apos;s verse , &quot; In the Days When the World was Wide &quot; ( 1896 ) .

An incomplete glossary of Australian terms and concepts which may prove
helpful to understanding this book :

Billy : Any container used to boil water , especially for tea ; a
special container designed for this purpose .

Bunyip : &#91; pronounced bun @-@ yup &#93; A large mythological creature , said
by the Aborigines to inhabit watery places . There may be some
relation to an actual creature that is now extinct . Lawson uses an
obsolete sense of the term , meaning &quot; imposter &quot; .

Gin : An aboriginal woman ; use of the term is analogous to &quot; squaw &quot;
in N. America . May be considered derogatory in modern usage .

Goanna : Any of various lizards of the genus Varanus ( monitor
lizards ) native to Australia .

Graft : Work ; hard work .

Gunyah : ( Aboriginal ) A rough or temporary hut or shelter in the
bush , especially one built from bark , branches , and the like . A
humpy , wurley , or mia @-@ mia . Variant : Gunya .

Jackeroo / Jackaroo : At the time Lawson wrote , a Jackaroo was a &quot; new
chum &quot; or newcomer to Australia , who sought work on a station to gain
experience . The term now applies to any young man working as a
station hand . A female station hand is a Jillaroo .

Jimmy Woodser : A person who drinks alone ; a drink drunk alone .

Larrikin : A hoodlum .

Lorry : A large , low wagon without sides , used for heavy loads .

Mia @-@ mia : ( Aboriginal ) A rough or temporary hut or shelter in the
bush , especially one built from bark , branches , and the like . A
humpy , wurley , or gunyah .

Native bear : A koala .

Pa : A Maori village .

&apos;Possum / Possum : In Australia , a class of marsupials that were
originally mistaken for the American animal of the same name . They
are not especially related to the possums of North and South
America , other than being marsupials .

Public / Pub . : The traditional pub. in Australia was a hotel with a
&quot; public &quot; bar -- hence the name . The modern pub has often ( not
always ) dispensed with the lodging , and concentrated on the bar .

Push : A group of people sharing something in common ; Lawson uses
the word in an older and more particular sense , as a gang of violent
city hoodlums .

Ratty : Shabby , dilapidated ; somewhat eccentric , perhaps even
slightly mad .

Selector : A free selector , a farmer who selected and settled land
by lease or license from the government .

Shout : To buy a round of drinks .

Skillion : A lean @-@ to or outbuilding .

Sliprails / slip @-@ rails : movable rails , forming a section of fence ,
which can be taken down in lieu of a gate . &quot; Over the Sliprails &quot; ,
the title of this volume , might be translated as &quot; Through the Gate &quot; .

Squatter : A person who first settled on land without government
permission , and later continued by lease or license , generally to
raise stock ; a wealthy rural landowner .

Station : A farm or ranch , especially one devoted to cattle or
sheep .

Stoush : Violence ; to do violence to .

Tea : In addition to the regular meaning , Tea can also mean a light
snack or a meal ( i.e. , where Tea is served ) . In particular , Morning
Tea ( about 10 AM ) and Afternoon Tea ( about 3 PM ) are nothing more
than a snack , but Evening Tea ( about 6 PM ) is a meal . When just
&quot; Tea &quot; is used , it usually means the evening meal . Variant : Tea-
time .

Tucker : Food .

Whare : &#91; pronounced war @-@ ee &#93; A Maori term for a hut or similar
dwelling .


Also : a hint with the seasons -- remember that the seasons are
reversed from those in the northern hemisphere , hence June may be
hot , but December is even hotter . Australia is at a lower latitude
than the United States , so the winters are not harsh by US
standards , and are not even mild in the north . In fact , large parts
of Australia are governed more by &quot; dry &quot; versus &quot; wet &quot; than by Spring-
Summer @-@ Fall @-@ Winter .
