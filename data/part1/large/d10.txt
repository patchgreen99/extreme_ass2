DEATH OF LOUIS XV .


Chapter 1.1.I.

Louis the Well @-@ Beloved .

President Henault , remarking on royal Surnames of Honour how difficult
it often is to ascertain not only why , but even when , they were
conferred , takes occasion in his sleek official way , to make a
philosophical reflection . &apos; The Surname of Bien @-@ aime ( Well @-@ beloved ) , &apos;
says he , &apos; which Louis XV. bears , will not leave posterity in the same
doubt . This Prince , in the year 1744 , while hastening from one end of
his kingdom to the other , and suspending his conquests in Flanders that
he might fly to the assistance of Alsace , was arrested at Metz by a
malady which threatened to cut short his days . At the news of this ,
Paris , all in terror , seemed a city taken by storm : the churches
resounded with supplications and groans ; the prayers of priests and
people were every moment interrupted by their sobs : and it was from an
interest so dear and tender that this Surname of Bien @-@ aime fashioned
itself , a title higher still than all the rest which this great Prince
has earned . &apos; ( Abrege Chronologique de l &apos;Histoire de France ( Paris ,
1775 ) , p . 701 . )

So stands it written ; in lasting memorial of that year 1744 . Thirty
other years have come and gone ; and &apos; this great Prince &apos; again lies
sick ; but in how altered circumstances now ! Churches resound not with
excessive groanings ; Paris is stoically calm : sobs interrupt no prayers ,
for indeed none are offered ; except Priests &apos; Litanies , read or chanted
at fixed money @-@ rate per hour , which are not liable to interruption . The
shepherd of the people has been carried home from Little Trianon , heavy
of heart , and been put to bed in his own Chateau of Versailles : the
flock knows it , and heeds it not . At most , in the immeasurable tide of
French Speech ( which ceases not day after day , and only ebbs towards the
short hours of night ) , may this of the royal sickness emerge from time
to time as an article of news . Bets are doubtless depending ; nay , some
people &apos; express themselves loudly in the streets . &apos; ( Memoires de M. le
Baron Besenval ( Paris , 1805 ) , ii . 59 @-@ 90 . ) But for the rest , on green
field and steepled city , the May sun shines out , the May evening fades ;
and men ply their useful or useless business as if no Louis lay in
danger .

Dame Dubarry , indeed , might pray , if she had a talent for it ; Duke
d &apos;Aiguillon too , Maupeou and the Parlement Maupeou : these , as they sit
in their high places , with France harnessed under their feet , know well
on what basis they continue there . Look to it , D &apos;Aiguillon ; sharply
as thou didst , from the Mill of St. Cast , on Quiberon and the invading
English ; thou , &apos; covered if not with glory yet with meal ! &apos; Fortune was
ever accounted inconstant : and each dog has but his day .

Forlorn enough languished Duke d &apos;Aiguillon , some years ago ; covered ,
as we said , with meal ; nay with worse . For La Chalotais , the Breton
Parlementeer , accused him not only of poltroonery and tyranny , but even
of concussion ( official plunder of money ) ; which accusations it was
easier to get &apos; quashed &apos; by backstairs Influences than to get answered :
neither could the thoughts , or even the tongues , of men be tied . Thus ,
under disastrous eclipse , had this grand @-@ nephew of the great Richelieu
to glide about ; unworshipped by the world ; resolute Choiseul , the abrupt
proud man , disdaining him , or even forgetting him . Little prospect but
to glide into Gascony , to rebuild Chateaus there , ( Arthur Young , Travels
during the years 1787 @-@ 88 @-@ 89 ( Bury St. Edmunds , 1792 ) , i . 44 . ) and die
inglorious killing game ! However , in the year 1770 , a certain young
soldier , Dumouriez by name , returning from Corsica , could see &apos; with
sorrow , at Compiegne , the old King of France , on foot , with doffed hat ,
in sight of his army , at the side of a magnificent phaeton , doing homage
the -- Dubarry . &apos; ( La Vie et les Memoires du General Dumouriez ( Paris ,
1822 ) , i . 141 . )

Much lay therein ! Thereby , for one thing , could D &apos;Aiguillon postpone
the rebuilding of his Chateau , and rebuild his fortunes first . For stout
Choiseul would discern in the Dubarry nothing but a wonderfully dizened
Scarlet @-@ woman ; and go on his way as if she were not . Intolerable : the
source of sighs , tears , of pettings and pouting ; which would not end
till &apos; France &apos; ( La France , as she named her royal valet ) finally mustered
heart to see Choiseul ; and with that &apos; quivering in the chin ( tremblement
du menton natural in such cases ) ( Besenval , Memoires , ii . 21 . ) faltered
out a dismissal : dismissal of his last substantial man , but pacification
of his scarlet @-@ woman . Thus D &apos;Aiguillon rose again , and culminated . And
with him there rose Maupeou , the banisher of Parlements ; who plants
you a refractory President &apos; at Croe in Combrailles on the top of steep
rocks , inaccessible except by litters , &apos; there to consider himself .
Likewise there rose Abbe Terray , dissolute Financier , paying eightpence
in the shilling , -- so that wits exclaim in some press at the playhouse ,
&quot; Where is Abbe Terray , that he might reduce us to two @-@ thirds ! &quot; And so
have these individuals ( verily by black @-@ art ) built them a Domdaniel ,
or enchanted Dubarrydom ; call it an Armida @-@ Palace , where they dwell
pleasantly ; Chancellor Maupeou &apos; playing blind @-@ man &apos;s @-@ buff &apos; with
the scarlet Enchantress ; or gallantly presenting her with dwarf
Negroes ; -- and a Most Christian King has unspeakable peace within doors ,
whatever he may have without . &quot; My Chancellor is a scoundrel ; but I
cannot do without him . &quot; ( Dulaure , Histoire de Paris ( Paris , 1824 ) , vii .
328 . )

Beautiful Armida @-@ Palace , where the inmates live enchanted lives ;
lapped in soft music of adulation ; waited on by the splendours of the
world ; -- which nevertheless hangs wondrously as by a single hair . Should
the Most Christian King die ; or even get seriously afraid of dying ! For ,
alas , had not the fair haughty Chateauroux to fly , with wet cheeks
and flaming heart , from that Fever @-@ scene at Metz ; driven forth by sour
shavelings ? She hardly returned , when fever and shavelings were both
swept into the background . Pompadour too , when Damiens wounded Royalty
&apos;slightly , under the fifth rib , &apos; and our drive to Trianon went off
futile , in shrieks and madly shaken torches , -- had to pack , and be in
readiness : yet did not go , the wound not proving poisoned . For his
Majesty has religious faith ; believes , at least in a Devil . And now
a third peril ; and who knows what may be in it ! For the Doctors look
grave ; ask privily , If his Majesty had not the small @-@ pox long ago ? -- and
doubt it may have been a false kind . Yes , Maupeou , pucker those sinister
brows of thine , and peer out on it with thy malign rat @-@ eyes : it is a
questionable case . Sure only that man is mortal ; that with the life
of one mortal snaps irrevocably the wonderfulest talisman , and all
Dubarrydom rushes off , with tumult , into infinite Space ; and ye , as
subterranean Apparitions are wont , vanish utterly , -- leaving only a smell
of sulphur !

These , and what holds of these may pray , -- to Beelzebub , or whoever will
hear them . But from the rest of France there comes , as was said , no
prayer ; or one of an opposite character , &apos; expressed openly in the
streets . &apos; Chateau or Hotel , were an enlightened Philosophism scrutinises
many things , is not given to prayer : neither are Rossbach victories ,
Terray Finances , nor , say only &apos; sixty thousand Lettres de Cachet &apos; ( which
is Maupeou &apos;s share ) , persuasives towards that . O Henault ! Prayers ? From
a France smitten ( by black @-@ art ) with plague after plague , and lying now
in shame and pain , with a Harlot &apos;s foot on its neck , what prayer can
come ? Those lank scarecrows , that prowl hunger @-@ stricken through all
highways and byways of French Existence , will they pray ? The dull
millions that , in the workshop or furrowfield , grind fore @-@ done at the
wheel of Labour , like haltered gin @-@ horses , if blind so much the quieter ?
Or they that in the Bicetre Hospital , &apos; eight to a bed , &apos; lie waiting
their manumission ? Dim are those heads of theirs , dull stagnant those
hearts : to them the great Sovereign is known mainly as the great
Regrater of Bread . If they hear of his sickness , they will answer with a
dull Tant pis pour lui ; or with the question , Will he die ?

Yes , will he die ? that is now , for all France , the grand question , and
hope ; whereby alone the King &apos;s sickness has still some interest .



Chapter 1.1.II.

Realised Ideals .

Such a changed France have we ; and a changed Louis . Changed , truly ; and
further than thou yet seest ! -- To the eye of History many things , in
that sick @-@ room of Louis , are now visible , which to the Courtiers there
present were invisible . For indeed it is well said , &apos; in every object
there is inexhaustible meaning ; the eye sees in it what the eye
brings means of seeing . &apos; To Newton and to Newton &apos;s Dog Diamond , what a
different pair of Universes ; while the painting on the optical retina of
both was , most likely , the same ! Let the Reader here , in this sick @-@ room
of Louis , endeavour to look with the mind too .

Time was when men could ( so to speak ) of a given man , by nourishing and
decorating him with fit appliances , to the due pitch , make themselves
a King , almost as the Bees do ; and what was still more to the purpose ,
loyally obey him when made . The man so nourished and decorated ,
thenceforth named royal , does verily bear rule ; and is said , and even
thought , to be , for example , &apos; prosecuting conquests in Flanders , &apos; when
he lets himself like luggage be carried thither : and no light luggage ;
covering miles of road . For he has his unblushing Chateauroux , with her
band @-@ boxes and rouge @-@ pots , at his side ; so that , at every new station ,
a wooden gallery must be run up between their lodgings . He has not only
his Maison @-@ Bouche , and Valetaille without end , but his very Troop
of Players , with their pasteboard coulisses , thunder @-@ barrels , their
kettles , fiddles , stage @-@ wardrobes , portable larders ( and chaffering
and quarrelling enough ) ; all mounted in wagons , tumbrils , second @-@ hand
chaises , -- sufficient not to conquer Flanders , but the patience of the
world . With such a flood of loud jingling appurtenances does he lumber
along , prosecuting his conquests in Flanders ; wonderful to behold . So
nevertheless it was and had been : to some solitary thinker it might seem
strange ; but even to him inevitable , not unnatural .

For ours is a most fictile world ; and man is the most fingent plastic
of creatures . A world not fixable ; not fathomable ! An unfathomable
Somewhat , which is Not we ; which we can work with , and live amidst , -- and
model , miraculously in our miraculous Being , and name World . -- But if the
very Rocks and Rivers ( as Metaphysic teaches ) are , in strict language ,
made by those outward Senses of ours , how much more , by the Inward
Sense , are all Phenomena of the spiritual kind : Dignities , Authorities ,
Holies , Unholies ! Which inward sense , moreover is not permanent like
the outward ones , but forever growing and changing . Does not the Black
African take of Sticks and Old Clothes ( say , exported Monmouth @-@ Street
cast @-@ clothes ) what will suffice , and of these , cunningly combining them ,
fabricate for himself an Eidolon ( Idol , or Thing Seen ) , and name it
Mumbo @-@ Jumbo ; which he can thenceforth pray to , with upturned awestruck
eye , not without hope ? The white European mocks ; but ought rather to
consider ; and see whether he , at home , could not do the like a little
more wisely .

So it was , we say , in those conquests of Flanders , thirty years ago : but
so it no longer is . Alas , much more lies sick than poor Louis : not the
French King only , but the French Kingship ; this too , after long rough
tear and wear , is breaking down . The world is all so changed ; so
much that seemed vigorous has sunk decrepit , so much that was not is
beginning to be ! -- Borne over the Atlantic , to the closing ear of Louis ,
King by the Grace of God , what sounds are these ; muffled ominous , new
in our centuries ? Boston Harbour is black with unexpected Tea : behold a
Pennsylvanian Congress gather ; and ere long , on Bunker Hill , DEMOCRACY
announcing , in rifle @-@ volleys death @-@ winged , under her Star Banner , to the
tune of Yankee @-@ doodle @-@ doo , that she is born , and , whirlwind @-@ like , will
envelope the whole world !

Sovereigns die and Sovereignties : how all dies , and is for a Time only ;
is a &apos; Time @-@ phantasm , yet reckons itself real ! &apos; The Merovingian Kings ,
slowly wending on their bullock @-@ carts through the streets of Paris ,
with their long hair flowing , have all wended slowly on , -- into Eternity .
Charlemagne sleeps at Salzburg , with truncheon grounded ; only Fable
expecting that he will awaken . Charles the Hammer , Pepin Bow @-@ legged ,
where now is their eye of menace , their voice of command ? Rollo and his
shaggy Northmen cover not the Seine with ships ; but have sailed off on
a longer voyage . The hair of Towhead ( Tete d &apos;etoupes ) now needs no
combing ; Iron @-@ cutter ( Taillefer ) cannot cut a cobweb ; shrill Fredegonda ,
shrill Brunhilda have had out their hot life @-@ scold , and lie silent ,
their hot life @-@ frenzy cooled . Neither from that black Tower de Nesle
descends now darkling the doomed gallant , in his sack , to the Seine
waters ; plunging into Night : for Dame de Nesle how cares not for this
world &apos;s gallantry , heeds not this world &apos;s scandal ; Dame de Nesle is
herself gone into Night . They are all gone ; sunk , -- down , down , with
the tumult they made ; and the rolling and the trampling of ever new
generations passes over them , and they hear it not any more forever .

And yet withal has there not been realised somewhat ? Consider ( to go no
further ) these strong Stone @-@ edifices , and what they hold ! Mud @-@ Town of
the Borderers ( Lutetia Parisiorum or Barisiorum ) has paved itself , has
spread over all the Seine Islands , and far and wide on each bank , and
become City of Paris , sometimes boasting to be &apos; Athens of Europe , &apos; and
even &apos; Capital of the Universe . &apos; Stone towers frown aloft ; long @-@ lasting ,
grim with a thousand years . Cathedrals are there , and a Creed ( or
memory of a Creed ) in them ; Palaces , and a State and Law . Thou seest
the Smoke @-@ vapour ; unextinguished Breath as of a thing living . Labour &apos;s
thousand hammers ring on her anvils : also a more miraculous Labour works
noiselessly , not with the Hand but with the Thought . How have cunning
workmen in all crafts , with their cunning head and right @-@ hand , tamed
the Four Elements to be their ministers ; yoking the winds to their
Sea @-@ chariot , making the very Stars their Nautical Timepiece ; -- and
written and collected a Bibliotheque du Roi ; among whose Books is the
Hebrew Book ! A wondrous race of creatures : these have been realised , and
what of Skill is in these : call not the Past Time , with all its confused
wretchednesses , a lost one .

Observe , however , that of man &apos;s whole terrestrial possessions and
attainments , unspeakably the noblest are his Symbols , divine or
divine @-@ seeming ; under which he marches and fights , with victorious
assurance , in this life @-@ battle : what we can call his Realised Ideals . Of
which realised ideals , omitting the rest , consider only these two :
his Church , or spiritual Guidance ; his Kingship , or temporal one . The
Church : what a word was there ; richer than Golconda and the treasures of
the world ! In the heart of the remotest mountains rises the little Kirk ;
the Dead all slumbering round it , under their white memorial @-@ stones , &apos; in
hope of a happy resurrection : &apos; -- dull wert thou , O Reader , if never in
any hour ( say of moaning midnight , when such Kirk hung spectral in
the sky , and Being was as if swallowed up of Darkness ) it spoke to
thee -- things unspeakable , that went into thy soul &apos;s soul . Strong was he
that had a Church , what we can call a Church : he stood thereby , though
&apos;in the centre of Immensities , in the conflux of Eternities , &apos; yet
manlike towards God and man ; the vague shoreless Universe had become for
him a firm city , and dwelling which he knew . Such virtue was in Belief ;
in these words , well spoken : I believe . Well might men prize their
Credo , and raise stateliest Temples for it , and reverend Hierarchies ,
and give it the tithe of their substance ; it was worth living for and
dying for .

Neither was that an inconsiderable moment when wild armed men first
raised their Strongest aloft on the buckler @-@ throne , and with clanging
armour and hearts , said solemnly : Be thou our Acknowledged Strongest ! In
such Acknowledged Strongest ( well named King , Kon @-@ ning , Can @-@ ning , or Man
that was Able ) what a Symbol shone now for them , -- significant with the
destinies of the world ! A Symbol of true Guidance in return for loving
Obedience ; properly , if he knew it , the prime want of man . A Symbol
which might be called sacred ; for is there not , in reverence for what is
better than we , an indestructible sacredness ? On which ground , too , it
was well said there lay in the Acknowledged Strongest a divine right ;
as surely there might in the Strongest , whether Acknowledged or
not , -- considering who made him strong . And so , in the midst of
confusions and unutterable incongruities ( as all growth is confused ) ,
did this of Royalty , with Loyalty environing it , spring up ; and grow
mysteriously , subduing and assimilating ( for a principle of Life was in
it ) ; till it also had grown world @-@ great , and was among the main Facts of
our modern existence . Such a Fact , that Louis XIV . , for example , could
answer the expostulatory Magistrate with his &quot; L &apos;Etat c &apos;est moi ( The
State ? I am the State ) ; &quot; and be replied to by silence and abashed looks .
So far had accident and forethought ; had your Louis Elevenths , with
the leaden Virgin in their hatband , and torture @-@ wheels and conical
oubliettes ( man @-@ eating ! ) under their feet ; your Henri Fourths , with
their prophesied social millennium , &apos; when every peasant should have his
fowl in the pot ; &apos; and on the whole , the fertility of this most fertile
Existence ( named of Good and Evil ) , -- brought it , in the matter of the
Kingship . Wondrous ! Concerning which may we not again say , that in
the huge mass of Evil , as it rolls and swells , there is ever some Good
working imprisoned ; working towards deliverance and triumph ?

How such Ideals do realise themselves ; and grow , wondrously , from amid
the incongruous ever @-@ fluctuating chaos of the Actual : this is what
World @-@ History , if it teach any thing , has to teach us , How they grow ;
and , after long stormy growth , bloom out mature , supreme ; then quickly
( for the blossom is brief ) fall into decay ; sorrowfully dwindle ; and
crumble down , or rush down , noisily or noiselessly disappearing . The
blossom is so brief ; as of some centennial Cactus @-@ flower , which after
a century of waiting shines out for hours ! Thus from the day when rough
Clovis , in the Champ de Mars , in sight of his whole army , had to cleave
retributively the head of that rough Frank , with sudden battleaxe , and
the fierce words , &quot; It was thus thou clavest the vase &quot; ( St. Remi &apos;s and
mine ) &quot; at Soissons , &quot; forward to Louis the Grand and his L &apos;Etat c &apos;est
moi , we count some twelve hundred years : and now this the very
next Louis is dying , and so much dying with him ! -- Nay , thus too , if
Catholicism , with and against Feudalism ( but not against Nature and
her bounty ) , gave us English a Shakspeare and Era of Shakspeare , and so
produced a blossom of Catholicism -- it was not till Catholicism itself ,
so far as Law could abolish it , had been abolished here .

But of those decadent ages in which no Ideal either grows or blossoms ?
When Belief and Loyalty have passed away , and only the cant and false
echo of them remains ; and all Solemnity has become Pageantry ; and
the Creed of persons in authority has become one of two things : an
Imbecility or a Macchiavelism ? Alas , of these ages World @-@ History can
take no notice ; they have to become compressed more and more ,
and finally suppressed in the Annals of Mankind ; blotted out as
spurious , -- which indeed they are . Hapless ages : wherein , if ever in any ,
it is an unhappiness to be born . To be born , and to learn only , by every
tradition and example , that God &apos;s Universe is Belial &apos;s and a Lie ; and
&apos;the Supreme Quack &apos; the hierarch of men ! In which mournfulest faith ,
nevertheless , do we not see whole generations ( two , and sometimes even
three successively ) live , what they call living ; and vanish , -- without
chance of reappearance ?

In such a decadent age , or one fast verging that way , had our poor Louis
been born . Grant also that if the French Kingship had not , by course of
Nature , long to live , he of all men was the man to accelerate Nature .
The Blossom of French Royalty , cactus @-@ like , has accordingly made an
astonishing progress . In those Metz days , it was still standing with all
its petals , though bedimmed by Orleans Regents and Roue Ministers and
Cardinals ; but now , in 1774 , we behold it bald , and the virtue nigh gone
out of it .

Disastrous indeed does it look with those same &apos; realised ideals , &apos; one
and all ! The Church , which in its palmy season , seven hundred years ago ,
could make an Emperor wait barefoot , in penance @-@ shift ; three days , in
the snow , has for centuries seen itself decaying ; reduced even to forget
old purposes and enmities , and join interest with the Kingship : on this
younger strength it would fain stay its decrepitude ; and these two will
henceforth stand and fall together . Alas , the Sorbonne still sits there ,
in its old mansion ; but mumbles only jargon of dotage , and no longer
leads the consciences of men : not the Sorbonne ; it is Encyclopedies ,
Philosophie , and who knows what nameless innumerable multitude of
ready Writers , profane Singers , Romancers , Players , Disputators , and
Pamphleteers , that now form the Spiritual Guidance of the world . The
world &apos;s Practical Guidance too is lost , or has glided into the same
miscellaneous hands . Who is it that the King ( Able @-@ man , named also Roi ,
Rex , or Director ) now guides ? His own huntsmen and prickers : when there
is to be no hunt , it is well said , &apos; Le Roi ne fera rien ( To @-@ day
his Majesty will do nothing ) . ( Memoires sur la Vie privee de Marie
Antoinette , par Madame Campan ( Paris , 1826 ) , i . 12 ) . He lives and
lingers there , because he is living there , and none has yet laid hands
on him .

The nobles , in like manner , have nearly ceased either to guide or
misguide ; and are now , as their master is , little more than ornamental
figures . It is long since they have done with butchering one another or
their king : the Workers , protected , encouraged by Majesty , have ages ago
built walled towns , and there ply their crafts ; will permit no Robber
Baron to &apos; live by the saddle , &apos; but maintain a gallows to prevent it .
Ever since that period of the Fronde , the Noble has changed his
fighting sword into a court rapier , and now loyally attends his king
as ministering satellite ; divides the spoil , not now by violence
and murder , but by soliciting and finesse . These men call themselves
supports of the throne , singular gilt @-@ pasteboard caryatides in that
singular edifice ! For the rest , their privileges every way are now much
curtailed . That law authorizing a Seigneur , as he returned from hunting ,
to kill not more than two Serfs , and refresh his feet in their warm
blood and bowels , has fallen into perfect desuetude , -- and even into
incredibility ; for if Deputy Lapoule can believe in it , and call for the
abrogation of it , so cannot we . ( Histoire de la Revolution Francaise ,
par Deux Amis de la Liberte ( Paris , 1793 ) , ii . 212 . ) No Charolois , for
these last fifty years , though never so fond of shooting , has been in
use to bring down slaters and plumbers , and see them roll from their
roofs ; ( Lacretelle , Histoire de France pendant le 18me Siecle ( Paris ,
1819 ) i . 271 . ) but contents himself with partridges and grouse .
Close @-@ viewed , their industry and function is that of dressing gracefully
and eating sumptuously . As for their debauchery and depravity , it is
perhaps unexampled since the era of Tiberius and Commodus . Nevertheless ,
one has still partly a feeling with the lady Marechale : &quot; Depend upon it ,
Sir , God thinks twice before damning a man of that quality . &quot; ( Dulaure ,
vii . 261 . ) These people , of old , surely had virtues , uses ; or they could
not have been there . Nay , one virtue they are still required to have
( for mortal man cannot live without a conscience ) : the virtue of perfect
readiness to fight duels .

Such are the shepherds of the people : and now how fares it with the
flock ? With the flock , as is inevitable , it fares ill , and ever worse .
They are not tended , they are only regularly shorn . They are sent for ,
to do statute @-@ labour , to pay statute @-@ taxes ; to fatten battle @-@ fields
( named &apos; Bed of honour &apos; ) with their bodies , in quarrels which are not
theirs ; their hand and toil is in every possession of man ; but for
themselves they have little or no possession . Untaught , uncomforted ,
unfed ; to pine dully in thick obscuration , in squalid destitution
and obstruction : this is the lot of the millions ; peuple taillable et
corveable a merci et misericorde . In Brittany they once rose in revolt
at the first introduction of Pendulum Clocks ; thinking it had something
to do with the Gabelle . Paris requires to be cleared out periodically
by the Police ; and the horde of hunger @-@ stricken vagabonds to be sent
wandering again over space -- for a time . &apos; During one such periodical
clearance , &apos; says Lacretelle , &apos; in May , 1750 , the Police had presumed
withal to carry off some reputable people &apos;s children , in the hope of
extorting ransoms for them . The mothers fill the public places
with cries of despair ; crowds gather , get excited : so many women in
destraction run about exaggerating the alarm : an absurd and horrid fable
arises among the people ; it is said that the doctors have ordered a
Great Person to take baths of young human blood for the restoration
of his own , all spoiled by debaucheries . Some of the rioters , &apos; adds
Lacretelle , quite coolly , &apos; were hanged on the following days : &apos; the
Police went on . ( Lacretelle , iii . 175 . ) O ye poor naked wretches ! and
this , then , is your inarticulate cry to Heaven , as of a dumb tortured
animal , crying from uttermost depths of pain and debasement ? Do these
azure skies , like a dead crystalline vault , only reverberate the echo of
it on you ? Respond to it only by &apos; hanging on the following days ? &apos; -- Not
so : not forever ! Ye are heard in Heaven . And the answer too will
come , -- in a horror of great darkness , and shakings of the world , and a
cup of trembling which all the nations shall drink .

Remark , meanwhile , how from amid the wrecks and dust of this universal
Decay new Powers are fashioning themselves , adapted to the new time and
its destinies . Besides the old Noblesse , originally of Fighters , there
is a new recognised Noblesse of Lawyers ; whose gala @-@ day and proud
battle @-@ day even now is . An unrecognised Noblesse of Commerce ; powerful
enough , with money in its pocket . Lastly , powerfulest of all , least
recognised of all , a Noblesse of Literature ; without steel on their
thigh , without gold in their purse , but with the &apos; grand thaumaturgic
faculty of Thought &apos; in their head . French Philosophism has arisen ; in
which little word how much do we include ! Here , indeed , lies properly
the cardinal symptom of the whole wide @-@ spread malady . Faith is gone out ;
Scepticism is come in . Evil abounds and accumulates : no man has Faith to
withstand it , to amend it , to begin by amending himself ; it must even
go on accumulating . While hollow langour and vacuity is the lot of the
Upper , and want and stagnation of the Lower , and universal misery
is very certain , what other thing is certain ? That a Lie cannot be
believed ! Philosophism knows only this : her other belief is mainly that ,
in spiritual supersensual matters no Belief is possible . Unhappy ! Nay ,
as yet the Contradiction of a Lie is some kind of Belief ; but the Lie
with its Contradiction once swept away , what will remain ? The five
unsatiated Senses will remain , the sixth insatiable Sense ( of vanity ) ;
the whole daemonic nature of man will remain , -- hurled forth to rage
blindly without rule or rein ; savage itself , yet with all the tools and
weapons of civilisation ; a spectacle new in History .

In such a France , as in a Powder @-@ tower , where fire unquenched and now
unquenchable is smoking and smouldering all round , has Louis XV. lain
down to die . With Pompadourism and Dubarryism , his Fleur @-@ de @-@ lis has been
shamefully struck down in all lands and on all seas ; Poverty invades
even the Royal Exchequer , and Tax @-@ farming can squeeze out no more ;
there is a quarrel of twenty @-@ five years &apos; standing with the Parlement ;
everywhere Want , Dishonesty , Unbelief , and hotbrained Sciolists for
state @-@ physicians : it is a portentous hour .

Such things can the eye of History see in this sick @-@ room of King Louis ,
which were invisible to the Courtiers there . It is twenty years , gone
Christmas @-@ day , since Lord Chesterfield , summing up what he had noted of
this same France , wrote , and sent off by post , the following words , that
have become memorable : &apos; In short , all the symptoms which I have ever
met with in History , previous to great Changes and Revolutions in
government , now exist and daily increase in France . &apos; ( Chesterfield &apos;s
Letters : December 25th , 1753 . )



Chapter 1.1.III.

Viaticum .

For the present , however , the grand question with the Governors of
France is : Shall extreme unction , or other ghostly viaticum ( to Louis ,
not to France ) , be administered ?

It is a deep question . For , if administered , if so much as spoken of ,
must not , on the very threshold of the business , Witch Dubarry vanish ;
hardly to return should Louis even recover ? With her vanishes Duke
d &apos;Aiguillon and Company , and all their Armida @-@ Palace , as was said ;
Chaos swallows the whole again , and there is left nothing but a smell
of brimstone . But then , on the other hand , what will the Dauphinists and
Choiseulists say ? Nay what may the royal martyr himself say , should he
happen to get deadly worse , without getting delirious ? For the present ,
he still kisses the Dubarry hand ; so we , from the ante @-@ room , can note :
but afterwards ? Doctors &apos; bulletins may run as they are ordered , but
it is &apos; confluent small @-@ pox , &apos; -- of which , as is whispered too , the
Gatekeepers &apos;s once so buxom Daughter lies ill : and Louis XV. is not a
man to be trifled with in his viaticum . Was he not wont to catechise his
very girls in the Parc @-@ aux @-@ cerfs , and pray with and for them , that they
might preserve their -- orthodoxy ? ( Dulaure , viii . ( 217 ) , Besenval , &amp; c . )
A strange fact , not an unexampled one ; for there is no animal so strange
as man .

For the moment , indeed , it were all well , could Archbishop Beaumont but
be prevailed upon -- to wink with one eye ! Alas , Beaumont would himself so
fain do it : for , singular to tell , the Church too , and whole posthumous
hope of Jesuitism , now hangs by the apron of this same unmentionable
woman . But then &apos; the force of public opinion &apos; ? Rigorous Christophe de
Beaumont , who has spent his life in persecuting hysterical Jansenists
and incredulous Non @-@ confessors ; or even their dead bodies , if no better
might be , -- how shall he now open Heaven &apos;s gate , and give Absolution with
the corpus delicti still under his nose ? Our Grand @-@ Almoner Roche @-@ Aymon ,
for his part , will not higgle with a royal sinner about turning of the
key : but there are other Churchmen ; there is a King &apos;s Confessor , foolish
Abbe Moudon ; and Fanaticism and Decency are not yet extinct . On the
whole , what is to be done ? The doors can be well watched ; the Medical
Bulletin adjusted ; and much , as usual , be hoped for from time and
chance .

The doors are well watched , no improper figure can enter . Indeed ,
few wish to enter ; for the putrid infection reaches even to the
Oeil @-@ de @-@ Boeuf ; so that &apos; more than fifty fall sick , and ten die . &apos; 
Mesdames the Princesses alone wait at the loathsome sick @-@ bed ; impelled
by filial piety . The three Princesses , Graille , Chiffe , Coche ( Rag ,
Snip , Pig , as he was wont to name them ) , are assiduous there ; when all
have fled . The fourth Princess Loque ( Dud ) , as we guess , is already in
the Nunnery , and can only give her orisons . Poor Graille and Sisterhood ,
they have never known a Father : such is the hard bargain Grandeur must
make . Scarcely at the Debotter ( when Royalty took off its boots ) could
they snatch up their &apos; enormous hoops , gird the long train round their
waists , huddle on their black cloaks of taffeta up to the very chin ; &apos;
and so , in fit appearance of full dress , &apos; every evening at six , &apos; walk
majestically in ; receive their royal kiss on the brow ; and then walk
majestically out again , to embroidery , small @-@ scandal , prayers , and
vacancy . If Majesty came some morning , with coffee of its own making ,
and swallowed it with them hastily while the dogs were uncoupling for
the hunt , it was received as a grace of Heaven . ( Campan , i . 11 @-@ 36 . ) Poor
withered ancient women ! in the wild tossings that yet await your fragile
existence , before it be crushed and broken ; as ye fly through hostile
countries , over tempestuous seas , are almost taken by the Turks ; and
wholly , in the Sansculottic Earthquake , know not your right hand from
your left , be this always an assured place in your remembrance : for the
act was good and loving ! To us also it is a little sunny spot , in that
dismal howling waste , where we hardly find another .

Meanwhile , what shall an impartial prudent Courtier do ? In these
delicate circumstances , while not only death or life , but even sacrament
or no sacrament , is a question , the skilfulest may falter . Few are so
happy as the Duke d &apos;Orleans and the Prince de Conde ; who can themselves ,
with volatile salts , attend the King &apos;s ante @-@ chamber ; and , at the same
time , send their brave sons ( Duke de Chartres , Egalite that is to be ;
Duke de Bourbon , one day Conde too , and famous among Dotards ) to wait
upon the Dauphin . With another few , it is a resolution taken ; jacta est
alea . Old Richelieu , -- when Beaumont , driven by public opinion , is at
last for entering the sick @-@ room , -- will twitch him by the rochet , into a
recess ; and there , with his old dissipated mastiff @-@ face , and the oiliest
vehemence , be seen pleading ( and even , as we judge by Beaumont &apos;s change
of colour , prevailing ) &apos; that the King be not killed by a proposition
in Divinity . &apos; Duke de Fronsac , son of Richelieu , can follow his father :
when the Cure of Versailles whimpers something about sacraments , he will
threaten to &apos; throw him out of the window if he mention such a thing . &apos; 

Happy these , we may say ; but to the rest that hover between two
opinions , is it not trying ? He who would understand to what a pass
Catholicism , and much else , had now got ; and how the symbols of
the Holiest have become gambling @-@ dice of the Basest , -- must read the
narrative of those things by Besenval , and Soulavie , and the other Court
Newsmen of the time . He will see the Versailles Galaxy all scattered
asunder , grouped into new ever @-@ shifting Constellations . There are nods
and sagacious glances ; go @-@ betweens , silk dowagers mysteriously gliding ,
with smiles for this constellation , sighs for that : there is tremor ,
of hope or desperation , in several hearts . There is the pale grinning
Shadow of Death , ceremoniously ushered along by another grinning Shadow ,
of Etiquette : at intervals the growl of Chapel Organs , like prayer by
machinery ; proclaiming , as in a kind of horrid diabolic horse @-@ laughter ,
Vanity of vanities , all is Vanity !



Chapter 1.1.IV.

Louis the Unforgotten .

Poor Louis ! With these it is a hollow phantasmagory , where like mimes
they mope and mowl , and utter false sounds for hire ; but with thee it is
frightful earnest .

Frightful to all men is Death ; from of old named King of Terrors . Our
little compact home of an Existence , where we dwelt complaining , yet as
in a home , is passing , in dark agonies , into an Unknown of Separation ,
Foreignness , unconditioned Possibility . The Heathen Emperor asks of his
soul : Into what places art thou now departing ? The Catholic King
must answer : To the Judgment @-@ bar of the Most High God ! Yes , it is a
summing @-@ up of Life ; a final settling , and giving @-@ in the &apos; account of the
deeds done in the body : &apos; they are done now ; and lie there unalterable ,
and do bear their fruits , long as Eternity shall last .

Louis XV. had always the kingliest abhorrence of Death . Unlike that
praying Duke of Orleans , Egalite &apos;s grandfather , -- for indeed several of
them had a touch of madness , -- who honesty believed that there was no
Death ! He , if the Court Newsmen can be believed , started up once on
a time , glowing with sulphurous contempt and indignation on his poor
Secretary , who had stumbled on the words , feu roi d &apos;Espagne ( the late
King of Spain ) : &quot; Feu roi , Monsieur ? &quot; -- &quot; Monseigneur , &quot; hastily answered
the trembling but adroit man of business , &quot; c &apos;est une titre qu &apos;ils
prennent ( &apos; tis a title they take ) . &quot; ( Besenval , i . 199 . ) Louis , we say ,
was not so happy ; but he did what he could . He would not suffer Death to
be spoken of ; avoided the sight of churchyards , funereal monuments , and
whatsoever could bring it to mind . It is the resource of the Ostrich ;
who , hard hunted , sticks his foolish head in the ground , and would fain
forget that his foolish unseeing body is not unseen too . Or sometimes ,
with a spasmodic antagonism , significant of the same thing , and of
more , he would go ; or stopping his court carriages , would send into
churchyards , and ask &apos; how many new graves there were today , &apos; though it
gave his poor Pompadour the disagreeablest qualms . We can figure the
thought of Louis that day , when , all royally caparisoned for hunting , he
met , at some sudden turning in the Wood of Senart , a ragged Peasant with
a coffin : &quot; For whom ? &quot; -- It was for a poor brother slave , whom Majesty had
sometimes noticed slaving in those quarters . &quot; What did he die of ? &quot; -- &quot; Of
hunger : &quot; -- the King gave his steed the spur . ( Campan , iii . 39 . )

But figure his thought , when Death is now clutching at his own
heart @-@ strings , unlooked for , inexorable ! Yes , poor Louis , Death has
found thee . No palace walls or life @-@ guards , gorgeous tapestries or gilt
buckram of stiffest ceremonial could keep him out ; but he is here ,
here at thy very life @-@ breath , and will extinguish it . Thou , whose whole
existence hitherto was a chimera and scenic show , at length becomest a
reality : sumptuous Versailles bursts asunder , like a dream , into void
Immensity ; Time is done , and all the scaffolding of Time falls wrecked
with hideous clangour round thy soul : the pale Kingdoms yawn open ; there
must thou enter , naked , all unking &apos;d , and await what is appointed
thee ! Unhappy man , there as thou turnest , in dull agony , on thy bed of
weariness , what a thought is thine ! Purgatory and Hell @-@ fire , now all @-@ too
possible , in the prospect ; in the retrospect , -- alas , what thing didst
thou do that were not better undone ; what mortal didst thou generously
help ; what sorrow hadst thou mercy on ? Do the &apos; five hundred thousand&apos;
ghosts , who sank shamefully on so many battle @-@ fields from Rossbach to
Quebec , that thy Harlot might take revenge for an epigram , -- crowd round
thee in this hour ? Thy foul Harem ; the curses of mothers , the tears
and infamy of daughters ? Miserable man ! thou &apos; hast done evil as thou
couldst : &apos; thy whole existence seems one hideous abortion and mistake of
Nature ; the use and meaning of thee not yet known . Wert thou a fabulous
Griffin , devouring the works of men ; daily dragging virgins to thy
cave ; -- clad also in scales that no spear would pierce : no spear but
Death &apos;s ? A Griffin not fabulous but real ! Frightful , O Louis , seem these
moments for thee . -- We will pry no further into the horrors of a sinner &apos;s
death @-@ bed .

And yet let no meanest man lay flattering unction to his soul . Louis was
a Ruler ; but art not thou also one ? His wide France , look at it from the
Fixed Stars ( themselves not yet Infinitude ) , is no wider than thy narrow
brickfield , where thou too didst faithfully , or didst unfaithfully . Man ,
&apos;Symbol of Eternity imprisoned into &apos; Time ! &apos; it is not thy works , which
are all mortal , infinitely little , and the greatest no greater than
the least , but only the Spirit thou workest in , that can have worth or
continuance .

But reflect , in any case , what a life @-@ problem this of poor Louis , when
he rose as Bien @-@ Aime from that Metz sick @-@ bed , really was ! What son
of Adam could have swayed such incoherences into coherence ? Could he ?
Blindest Fortune alone has cast him on the top of it : he swims
there ; can as little sway it as the drift @-@ log sways the wind @-@ tossed
moon @-@ stirred Atlantic . &quot; What have I done to be so loved ? &quot; he said then .
He may say now : What have I done to be so hated ? Thou hast done nothing ,
poor Louis ! Thy fault is properly even this , that thou didst nothing .
What could poor Louis do ? Abdicate , and wash his hands of it , -- in favour
of the first that would accept ! Other clear wisdom there was none for
him . As it was , he stood gazing dubiously , the absurdest mortal extant
( a very Solecism Incarnate ) , into the absurdest confused world ; -- wherein
at lost nothing seemed so certain as that he , the incarnate Solecism ,
had five senses ; that were Flying Tables ( Tables Volantes , which vanish
through the floor , to come back reloaded ) . and a Parc @-@ aux @-@ cerfs .

Whereby at least we have again this historical curiosity : a human
being in an original position ; swimming passively , as on some boundless
&apos;Mother of Dead Dogs , &apos; towards issues which he partly saw . For Louis had
withal a kind of insight in him . So , when a new Minister of Marine , or
what else it might be , came announcing his new era , the Scarlet @-@ woman
would hear from the lips of Majesty at supper : &quot; He laid out his ware
like another ; promised the beautifulest things in the world ; not a
thing of which will come : he does not know this region ; he will see . &quot; Or
again : &quot; &apos; Tis the twentieth time I hear all that ; France will never get
a Navy , I believe . &quot; How touching also was this : &quot; If I were Lieutenant of
Police , I would prohibit those Paris cabriolets . &quot; ( Journal de Madame de
Hausset , p . 293 , &amp; c . )

Doomed mortal ; -- for is it not a doom to be Solecism incarnate ! A new
Roi Faineant , King Donothing ; but with the strangest new Mayor of
the Palace : no bow @-@ legged Pepin now , but that same cloud @-@ capt ,
fire @-@ breathing Spectre of DEMOCRACY ; incalculable , which is enveloping
the world ! -- Was Louis no wickeder than this or the other private
Donothing and Eatall ; such as we often enough see , under the name of
Man , and even Man of Pleasure , cumbering God &apos;s diligent Creation , for
a time ? Say , wretcheder ! His Life @-@ solecism was seen and felt of a whole
scandalised world ; him endless Oblivion cannot engulf , and swallow to
endless depths , -- not yet for a generation or two .

However , be this as it will , we remark , not without interest , that &apos; on
the evening of the 4th , &apos; Dame Dubarry issues from the sick @-@ room , with
perceptible &apos; trouble in her visage . &apos; It is the fourth evening of May ,
year of Grace 1774 . Such a whispering in the Oeil @-@ de @-@ Boeuf ! Is he dying
then ? What can be said is , that Dubarry seems making up her packages ;
she sails weeping through her gilt boudoirs , as if taking leave .
D &apos;Aiguilon and Company are near their last card ; nevertheless they will
not yet throw up the game . But as for the sacramental controversy , it is
as good as settled without being mentioned ; Louis can send for his Abbe
Moudon in the course of next night , be confessed by him , some say for
the space of &apos; seventeen minutes , &apos; and demand the sacraments of his own
accord .

Nay , already , in the afternoon , behold is not this your Sorceress
Dubarry with the handkerchief at her eyes , mounting D &apos;Aiguillon &apos;s
chariot ; rolling off in his Duchess &apos;s consolatory arms ? She is gone ;
and her place knows her no more . Vanish , false Sorceress ; into Space !
Needless to hover at neighbouring Ruel ; for thy day is done . Shut are
the royal palace @-@ gates for evermore ; hardly in coming years shalt
thou , under cloud of night , descend once , in black domino , like a black
night @-@ bird , and disturb the fair Antoinette &apos;s music @-@ party in the Park :
all Birds of Paradise flying from thee , and musical windpipes growing
mute . ( Campan , i . 197 . ) Thou unclean , yet unmalignant , not unpitiable
thing ! What a course was thine : from that first trucklebed ( in Joan of
Arc &apos;s country ) where thy mother bore thee , with tears , to an unnamed
father : forward , through lowest subterranean depths , and over highest
sunlit heights , of Harlotdom and Rascaldom -- to the guillotine @-@ axe , which
shears away thy vainly whimpering head ! Rest there uncursed ; only buried
and abolished : what else befitted thee ?

Louis , meanwhile , is in considerable impatience for his sacraments ;
sends more than once to the window , to see whether they are not coming .
Be of comfort , Louis , what comfort thou canst : they are under way ,
those sacraments . Towards six in the morning , they arrive . Cardinal
Grand @-@ Almoner Roche @-@ Aymon is here , in pontificals , with his pyxes and
his tools ; he approaches the royal pillow ; elevates his wafer ; mutters
or seems to mutter somewhat ; -- and so ( as the Abbe Georgel , in words
that stick to one , expresses it ) has Louis &apos; made the amende honorable to
God ; &apos; so does your Jesuit construe it . -- &quot; Wa , Wa , &quot; as the wild Clotaire
groaned out , when life was departing , &quot; what great God is this that
pulls down the strength of the strongest kings ! &quot; ( Gregorius Turonensis ,
Histor. lib. iv. cap . 21 . )

The amende honorable , what &apos; legal apology &apos; you will , to God : -- but not ,
if D &apos;Aiguillon can help it , to man . Dubarry still hovers in his
mansion at Ruel ; and while there is life , there is hope . Grand @-@ Almoner
Roche @-@ Aymon , accordingly ( for he seems to be in the secret ) , has
no sooner seen his pyxes and gear repacked , then he is stepping
majestically forth again , as if the work were done ! But King &apos;s Confessor
Abbe Moudon starts forward ; with anxious acidulent face , twitches him by
the sleeve ; whispers in his ear . Whereupon the poor Cardinal must turn
round ; and declare audibly ; &quot; That his Majesty repents of any subjects of
scandal he may have given ( a pu donner ) ; and purposes , by the strength
of Heaven assisting him , to avoid the like -- for the future ! &quot; Words
listened to by Richelieu with mastiff @-@ face , growing blacker ; answered
to , aloud , &apos; with an epithet , &apos; -- which Besenval will not repeat . Old
Richelieu , conqueror of Minorca , companion of Flying @-@ Table orgies ,
perforator of bedroom walls , ( Besenval , i . 159 @-@ 172 . Genlis ; Duc de
Levis , &amp; c . ) is thy day also done ?

Alas , the Chapel organs may keep going ; the Shrine of Sainte Genevieve
be let down , and pulled up again , -- without effect . In the evening the
whole Court , with Dauphin and Dauphiness , assist at the Chapel : priests
are hoarse with chanting their &apos; Prayers of Forty Hours ; &apos; and the heaving
bellows blow . Almost frightful ! For the very heaven blackens ; battering
rain @-@ torrents dash , with thunder ; almost drowning the organ &apos;s voice : and
electric fire @-@ flashes make the very flambeaux on the altar pale . So that
the most , as we are told , retired , when it was over , with hurried steps ,
&apos;in a state of meditation ( recueillement ) , &apos; and said little or nothing .
( Weber , Memoires concernant Marie @-@ Antoinette ( London , 1809 ) , i . 22 . )

So it has lasted for the better half of a fortnight ; the Dubarry gone
almost a week . Besenval says , all the world was getting impatient que
cela finit ; that poor Louis would have done with it . It is now the 10th
of May 1774 . He will soon have done now .

This tenth May day falls into the loathsome sick @-@ bed ; but dull ,
unnoticed there : for they that look out of the windows are quite
darkened ; the cistern @-@ wheel moves discordant on its axis ; Life , like a
spent steed , is panting towards the goal . In their remote apartments ,
Dauphin and Dauphiness stand road @-@ ready ; all grooms and equerries booted
and spurred : waiting for some signal to escape the house of pestilence .
( One grudges to interfere with the beautiful theatrical &apos; candle , &apos; which
Madame Campan ( i . 79 ) has lit on this occasion , and blown out at the
moment of death . What candles might be lit or blown out , in so large an
Establishment as that of Versailles , no man at such distance would like
to affirm : at the same time , as it was two o &apos;clock in a May Afternoon ,
and these royal Stables must have been some five or six hundred yards
from the royal sick @-@ room , the &apos; candle &apos; does threaten to go out in spite
of us . It remains burning indeed -- in her fantasy ; throwing light on much
in those Memoires of hers . ) And , hark ! across the Oeil @-@ de @-@ Boeuf , what
sound is that ; sound &apos; terrible and absolutely like thunder &apos; ? It is
the rush of the whole Court , rushing as in wager , to salute the new
Sovereigns : Hail to your Majesties ! The Dauphin and Dauphiness are King
and Queen ! Over @-@ powered with many emotions , they two fall on their knees
together , and , with streaming tears , exclaim , &quot; O God , guide us , protect
us ; we are too young to reign ! &quot; -- Too young indeed .

Thus , in any case , &apos; with a sound absolutely like thunder , &apos; has the
Horologe of Time struck , and an old Era passed away . The Louis that was ,
lies forsaken , a mass of abhorred clay ; abandoned &apos; to some poor persons ,
and priests of the Chapelle Ardente , &apos; -- who make haste to put him &apos; in two
lead coffins , pouring in abundant spirits of wine . &apos; The new Louis with
his Court is rolling towards Choisy , through the summer afternoon : the
royal tears still flow ; but a word mispronounced by Monseigneur d &apos;Artois
sets them all laughing , and they weep no more . Light mortals , how ye
walk your light life @-@ minuet , over bottomless abysses , divided from you
by a film !

For the rest , the proper authorities felt that no Funeral could be too
unceremonious . Besenval himself thinks it was unceremonious enough . Two
carriages containing two noblemen of the usher species , and a Versailles
clerical person ; some score of mounted pages , some fifty palfreniers ;
these , with torches , but not so much as in black , start from Versailles
on the second evening with their leaden bier . At a high trot they start ;
and keep up that pace . For the jibes ( brocards ) of those Parisians , who
stand planted in two rows , all the way to St. Denis , and &apos; give vent to
their pleasantry , the characteristic of the nation , &apos; do not tempt one
to slacken . Towards midnight the vaults of St. Denis receive their
own ; unwept by any eye of all these ; if not by poor Loque his neglected
Daughter &apos;s , whose Nunnery is hard by .

Him they crush down , and huddle under @-@ ground , in this impatient way ; him
and his era of sin and tyranny and shame ; for behold a New Era is come ;
the future all the brighter that the past was base .

THE PAPER AGE


Chapter 1.2.I.

Astraea Redux .

A paradoxical philosopher , carrying to the uttermost length that
aphorism of Montesquieu &apos;s , &apos; Happy the people whose annals are tiresome , &apos;
has said , &apos; Happy the people whose annals are vacant . &apos; In which saying ,
mad as it looks , may there not still be found some grain of reason ? For
truly , as it has been written , &apos; Silence is divine , &apos; and of Heaven ; so
in all earthly things too there is a silence which is better than any
speech . Consider it well , the Event , the thing which can be spoken of
and recorded , is it not , in all cases , some disruption , some solution of
continuity ? Were it even a glad Event , it involves change , involves loss
( of active Force ) ; and so far , either in the past or in the present , is
an irregularity , a disease . Stillest perseverance were our blessedness ;
not dislocation and alteration , -- could they be avoided .

The oak grows silently , in the forest , a thousand years ; only in the
thousandth year , when the woodman arrives with his axe , is there heard
an echoing through the solitudes ; and the oak announces itself when ,
with a far @-@ sounding crash , it falls . How silent too was the planting of
the acorn ; scattered from the lap of some wandering wind ! Nay , when
our oak flowered , or put on its leaves ( its glad Events ) , what shout of
proclamation could there be ? Hardly from the most observant a word of
recognition . These things befell not , they were slowly done ; not in an
hour , but through the flight of days : what was to be said of it ? This
hour seemed altogether as the last was , as the next would be .

It is thus everywhere that foolish Rumour babbles not of what was done ,
but of what was misdone or undone ; and foolish History ( ever , more or
less , the written epitomised synopsis of Rumour ) knows so little
that were not as well unknown . Attila Invasions , Walter @-@ the @-@ Penniless
Crusades , Sicilian Vespers , Thirty @-@ Years Wars : mere sin and misery ; not
work , but hindrance of work ! For the Earth , all this while , was yearly
green and yellow with her kind harvests ; the hand of the craftsman , the
mind of the thinker rested not : and so , after all , and in spite of all ,
we have this so glorious high @-@ domed blossoming World ; concerning which ,
poor History may well ask , with wonder , Whence it came ? She knows so
little of it , knows so much of what obstructed it , what would have
rendered it impossible . Such , nevertheless , by necessity or foolish
choice , is her rule and practice ; whereby that paradox , &apos; Happy the
people whose annals are vacant , &apos; is not without its true side .

And yet , what seems more pertinent to note here , there is a stillness ,
not of unobstructed growth , but of passive inertness , and symptom of
imminent downfall . As victory is silent , so is defeat . Of the opposing
forces the weaker has resigned itself ; the stronger marches on ,
noiseless now , but rapid , inevitable : the fall and overturn will not be
noiseless . How all grows , and has its period , even as the herbs of the
fields , be it annual , centennial , millennial ! All grows and dies , each
by its own wondrous laws , in wondrous fashion of its own ; spiritual
things most wondrously of all . Inscrutable , to the wisest , are these
latter ; not to be prophesied of , or understood . If when the oak stands
proudliest flourishing to the eye , you know that its heart is sound , it
is not so with the man ; how much less with the Society , with the Nation
of men ! Of such it may be affirmed even that the superficial aspect ,
that the inward feeling of full health , is generally ominous . For indeed
it is of apoplexy , so to speak , and a plethoric lazy habit of body , that
Churches , Kingships , Social Institutions , oftenest die . Sad , when such
Institution plethorically says to itself , Take thy ease , thou hast goods
laid up ; -- like the fool of the Gospel , to whom it was answered , Fool ,
this night thy life shall be required of thee !

Is it the healthy peace , or the ominous unhealthy , that rests on France ,
for these next Ten Years ? Over which the Historian can pass lightly ,
without call to linger : for as yet events are not , much less
performances . Time of sunniest stillness ; -- shall we call it , what all
men thought it , the new Age of God ? Call it at least , of Paper ; which
in many ways is the succedaneum of Gold . Bank @-@ paper , wherewith you
can still buy when there is no gold left ; Book @-@ paper , splendent with
Theories , Philosophies , Sensibilities , -- beautiful art , not only of
revealing Thought , but also of so beautifully hiding from us the want
of Thought ! Paper is made from the rags of things that did once exist ;
there are endless excellences in Paper . -- What wisest Philosophe , in this
halcyon uneventful period , could prophesy that there was approaching ,
big with darkness and confusion , the event of events ? Hope ushers in a
Revolution , -- as earthquakes are preceded by bright weather . On the
Fifth of May , fifteen years hence , old Louis will not be sending for
the Sacraments ; but a new Louis , his grandson , with the whole pomp of
astonished intoxicated France , will be opening the States @-@ General .

Dubarrydom and its D &apos;Aiguillons are gone forever . There is a young ,
still docile , well @-@ intentioned King ; a young , beautiful and bountiful ,
well @-@ intentioned Queen ; and with them all France , as it were , become
young . Maupeou and his Parlement have to vanish into thick night ;
respectable Magistrates , not indifferent to the Nation , were it only
for having been opponents of the Court , can descend unchained from their
&apos;steep rocks at Croe in Combrailles &apos; and elsewhere , and return singing
praises : the old Parlement of Paris resumes its functions . Instead of a
profligate bankrupt Abbe Terray , we have now , for Controller @-@ General , a
virtuous philosophic Turgot , with a whole Reformed France in his
head . By whom whatsoever is wrong , in Finance or otherwise , will be
righted , -- as far as possible . Is it not as if Wisdom herself were
henceforth to have seat and voice in the Council of Kings ? Turgot has
taken office with the noblest plainness of speech to that effect ; been
listened to with the noblest royal trustfulness . ( Turgot &apos;s Letter :
Condorcet , Vie de Turgot ( Oeuvres de Condorcet , t. v. ) , p . 67 . The date
is 24th August , 1774 . ) It is true , as King Louis objects , &quot; They say he
never goes to mass ; &quot; but liberal France likes him little worse for that ;
liberal France answers , &quot; The Abbe Terray always went . &quot; Philosophism
sees , for the first time , a Philosophe ( or even a Philosopher ) in
office : she in all things will applausively second him ; neither will
light old Maurepas obstruct , if he can easily help it .

Then how &apos; sweet &apos; are the manners ; vice &apos; losing all its deformity ; &apos;
becoming decent ( as established things , making regulations for
themselves , do ) ; becoming almost a kind of &apos; sweet &apos; virtue ! Intelligence
so abounds ; irradiated by wit and the art of conversation . Philosophism
sits joyful in her glittering saloons , the dinner @-@ guest of Opulence
grown ingenuous , the very nobles proud to sit by her ; and preaches ,
lifted up over all Bastilles , a coming millennium . From far Ferney ,
Patriarch Voltaire gives sign : veterans Diderot , D &apos;Alembert have
lived to see this day ; these with their younger Marmontels , Morellets ,
Chamforts , Raynals , make glad the spicy board of rich ministering
Dowager , of philosophic Farmer @-@ General . O nights and suppers of the
gods ! Of a truth , the long @-@ demonstrated will now be done : &apos; the Age
of Revolutions approaches &apos; ( as Jean Jacques wrote ) , but then of happy
blessed ones . Man awakens from his long somnambulism ; chases the
Phantasms that beleagured and bewitched him . Behold the new morning
glittering down the eastern steeps ; fly , false Phantasms , from its
shafts of light ; let the Absurd fly utterly forsaking this lower
Earth for ever . It is Truth and Astraea Redux that ( in the shape of
Philosophism ) henceforth reign . For what imaginable purpose was man
made , if not to be &apos; happy &apos; ? By victorious Analysis , and Progress of the
Species , happiness enough now awaits him . Kings can become philosophers ;
or else philosophers Kings . Let but Society be once rightly
constituted , -- by victorious Analysis . The stomach that is empty shall be
filled ; the throat that is dry shall be wetted with wine . Labour itself
shall be all one as rest ; not grievous , but joyous . Wheatfields , one
would think , cannot come to grow untilled ; no man made clayey , or made
weary thereby ; -- unless indeed machinery will do it ? Gratuitous Tailors
and Restaurateurs may start up , at fit intervals , one as yet sees not
how . But if each will , according to rule of Benevolence , have a care
for all , then surely -- no one will be uncared for . Nay , who knows but ,
by sufficiently victorious Analysis , &apos; human life may be indefinitely
lengthened , &apos; and men get rid of Death , as they have already done of
the Devil ? We shall then be happy in spite of Death and the Devil . -- So
preaches magniloquent Philosophism her Redeunt Saturnia regna .

The prophetic song of Paris and its Philosophes is audible enough in
the Versailles Oeil @-@ de @-@ Boeuf ; and the Oeil @-@ de @-@ Boeuf , intent chiefly on
nearer blessedness , can answer , at worst , with a polite &quot; Why not ? &quot; Good
old cheery Maurepas is too joyful a Prime Minister to dash the world &apos;s
joy . Sufficient for the day be its own evil . Cheery old man , he cuts his
jokes , and hovers careless along ; his cloak well adjusted to the wind ,
if so be he may please all persons . The simple young King , whom a
Maurepas cannot think of troubling with business , has retired into the
interior apartments ; taciturn , irresolute ; though with a sharpness of
temper at times : he , at length , determines on a little smithwork ; and
so , in apprenticeship with a Sieur Gamain ( whom one day he shall have
little cause to bless ) , is learning to make locks . ( Campan , i . 125 . )
It appears further , he understood Geography ; and could read English .
Unhappy young King , his childlike trust in that foolish old Maurepas
deserved another return . But friend and foe , destiny and himself have
combined to do him hurt .

Meanwhile the fair young Queen , in her halls of state , walks like a
goddess of Beauty , the cynosure of all eyes ; as yet mingles not with
affairs ; heeds not the future ; least of all , dreads it . Weber and Campan
( Ib. i . 100 @-@ 151 . Weber , i . 11 @-@ 50 . ) have pictured her , there within the
royal tapestries , in bright boudoirs , baths , peignoirs , and the Grand
and Little Toilette ; with a whole brilliant world waiting obsequious on
her glance : fair young daughter of Time , what things has Time in store
for thee ! Like Earth &apos;s brightest Appearance , she moves gracefully ,
environed with the grandeur of Earth : a reality , and yet a magic vision ;
for , behold , shall not utter Darkness swallow it ! The soft young heart
adopts orphans , portions meritorious maids , delights to succour the
poor , -- such poor as come picturesquely in her way ; and sets the fashion
of doing it ; for as was said , Benevolence has now begun reigning . In
her Duchess de Polignac , in Princess de Lamballe , she enjoys something
almost like friendship ; now too , after seven long years , she has a
child , and soon even a Dauphin , of her own ; can reckon herself , as
Queens go , happy in a husband .

Events ? The Grand events are but charitable Feasts of Morals ( Fetes des
moeurs ) , with their Prizes and Speeches ; Poissarde Processions to the
Dauphin &apos;s cradle ; above all , Flirtations , their rise , progress , decline
and fall . There are Snow @-@ statues raised by the poor in hard winter to
a Queen who has given them fuel . There are masquerades , theatricals ;
beautifyings of little Trianon , purchase and repair of St. Cloud ;
journeyings from the summer Court @-@ Elysium to the winter one . There
are poutings and grudgings from the Sardinian Sisters @-@ in @-@ law ( for the
Princes too are wedded ) ; little jealousies , which Court @-@ Etiquette can
moderate . Wholly the lightest @-@ hearted frivolous foam of Existence ; yet
an artfully refined foam ; pleasant were it not so costly , like that
which mantles on the wine of Champagne !

Monsieur , the King &apos;s elder Brother , has set up for a kind of wit ; and
leans towards the Philosophe side . Monseigneur d &apos;Artois pulls the mask
from a fair impertinent ; fights a duel in consequence , -- almost drawing
blood . ( Besenval , ii . 282 @-@ 330 . ) He has breeches of a kind new in this
world ; -- a fabulous kind ; &apos; four tall lackeys , &apos; says Mercier , as if he
had seen it , &apos; hold him up in the air , that he may fall into the garment
without vestige of wrinkle ; from which rigorous encasement the same
four , in the same way , and with more effort , must deliver him at night . &apos; 
( Mercier , Nouveau Paris , iii . 147 . ) This last is he who now , as a gray
time @-@ worn man , sits desolate at Gratz ; ( A.D. 1834 . ) having winded up
his destiny with the Three Days . In such sort are poor mortals swept and
shovelled to and fro .



Chapter 1.2.II.

Petition in Hieroglyphs .

With the working people , again it is not so well . Unlucky ! For there are
twenty to twenty @-@ five millions of them . Whom , however , we lump together
into a kind of dim compendious unity , monstrous but dim , far off , as the
canaille ; or , more humanely , as &apos; the masses . &apos; Masses , indeed : and yet ,
singular to say , if , with an effort of imagination , thou follow them ,
over broad France , into their clay hovels , into their garrets and
hutches , the masses consist all of units . Every unit of whom has his own
heart and sorrows ; stands covered there with his own skin , and if you
prick him he will bleed . O purple Sovereignty , Holiness , Reverence ;
thou , for example , Cardinal Grand @-@ Almoner , with thy plush covering of
honour , who hast thy hands strengthened with dignities and moneys , and
art set on thy world watch @-@ tower solemnly , in sight of God , for such
ends , -- what a thought : that every unit of these masses is a miraculous
Man , even as thyself art ; struggling , with vision , or with blindness ,
for his infinite Kingdom ( this life which he has got , once only , in the
middle of Eternities ) ; with a spark of the Divinity , what thou callest
an immortal soul , in him !

Dreary , languid do these struggle in their obscure remoteness ; their
hearth cheerless , their diet thin . For them , in this world , rises no Era
of Hope ; hardly now in the other , -- if it be not hope in the gloomy rest
of Death , for their faith too is failing . Untaught , uncomforted , unfed !
A dumb generation ; their voice only an inarticulate cry : spokesman ,
in the King &apos;s Council , in the world &apos;s forum , they have none that finds
credence . At rare intervals ( as now , in 1775 ) , they will fling down
their hoes and hammers ; and , to the astonishment of thinking mankind ,
( Lacretelle , France pendant le 18me Siecle , ii . 455 . Biographie
Universelle , para Turgot ( by Durozoir ) . ) flock hither and thither ,
dangerous , aimless ; get the length even of Versailles . Turgot is
altering the Corn @-@ trade , abrogating the absurdest Corn @-@ laws ; there is
dearth , real , or were it even &apos; factitious ; &apos; an indubitable scarcity of
bread . And so , on the second day of May 1775 , these waste multitudes
do here , at Versailles Chateau , in wide @-@ spread wretchedness , in sallow
faces , squalor , winged raggedness , present , as in legible hieroglyphic
writing , their Petition of Grievances . The Chateau gates have to be
shut ; but the King will appear on the balcony , and speak to them . They
have seen the King &apos;s face ; their Petition of Grievances has been , if not
read , looked at . For answer , two of them are hanged , &apos; on a new gallows
forty feet high ; &apos; and the rest driven back to their dens , -- for a time .

Clearly a difficult &apos; point &apos; for Government , that of dealing with these
masses ; -- if indeed it be not rather the sole point and problem
of Government , and all other points mere accidental crotchets ,
superficialities , and beatings of the wind ! For let Charter @-@ Chests , Use
and Wont , Law common and special say what they will , the masses count to
so many millions of units ; made , to all appearance , by God , -- whose Earth
this is declared to be . Besides , the people are not without ferocity ;
they have sinews and indignation . Do but look what holiday old Marquis
Mirabeau , the crabbed old friend of Men , looked on , in these same years ,
from his lodging , at the Baths of Mont d &apos;Or : &apos; The savages descending
in torrents from the mountains ; our people ordered not to go out . The
Curate in surplice and stole ; Justice in its peruke ; Marechausee sabre
in hand , guarding the place , till the bagpipes can begin . The dance
interrupted , in a quarter of an hour , by battle ; the cries , the
squealings of children , of infirm persons , and other assistants , tarring
them on , as the rabble does when dogs fight : frightful men , or rather
frightful wild animals , clad in jupes of coarse woollen , with large
girdles of leather studded with copper nails ; of gigantic stature ,
heightened by high wooden @-@ clogs ( sabots ) ; rising on tiptoe to see the
fight ; tramping time to it ; rubbing their sides with their elbows : their
faces haggard ( figures haves ) , and covered with their long greasy hair ;
the upper part of the visage waxing pale , the lower distorting itself
into the attempt at a cruel laugh and a sort of ferocious impatience .
And these people pay the taille ! And you want further to take their salt
from them ! And you know not what it is you are stripping barer , or
as you call it , governing ; what by the spurt of your pen , in its
cold dastard indifference , you will fancy you can starve always with
impunity ; always till the catastrophe come ! -- Ah Madame , such Government
by Blindman &apos;s @-@ buff , stumbling along too far , will end in the General
Overturn ( culbute generale ) . ( Memoires de Mirabeau , ecrits par Lui @-@ meme ,
par son Pere , son Oncle et son Fils Adoptif ( Paris , 34 @-@ 5 ) , ii.186. )

Undoubtedly a dark feature this in an Age of Gold , -- Age , at least ,
of Paper and Hope ! Meanwhile , trouble us not with thy prophecies , O
croaking Friend of Men : &apos; tis long that we have heard such ; and still the
old world keeps wagging , in its old way .



Chapter 1.2.III.

Questionable .

Or is this same Age of Hope itself but a simulacrum ; as Hope too often
is ? Cloud @-@ vapour with rainbows painted on it , beautiful to see , to sail
towards , -- which hovers over Niagara Falls ? In that case , victorious
Analysis will have enough to do .

Alas , yes ! a whole world to remake , if she could see it ; work for
another than she ! For all is wrong , and gone out of joint ; the inward
spiritual , and the outward economical ; head or heart , there is no
soundness in it . As indeed , evils of all sorts are more or less of kin ,
and do usually go together : especially it is an old truth , that wherever
huge physical evil is , there , as the parent and origin of it , has
moral evil to a proportionate extent been . Before those five @-@ and @-@ twenty
labouring Millions , for instance , could get that haggardness of face ,
which old Mirabeau now looks on , in a Nation calling itself Christian ,
and calling man the brother of man , -- what unspeakable , nigh infinite
Dishonesty ( of seeming and not being ) in all manner of Rulers , and
appointed Watchers , spiritual and temporal , must there not , through long
ages , have gone on accumulating ! It will accumulate : moreover , it will
reach a head ; for the first of all Gospels is this , that a Lie cannot
endure for ever .

In fact , if we pierce through that rosepink vapour of Sentimentalism ,
Philanthropy , and Feasts of Morals , there lies behind it one of the
sorriest spectacles . You might ask , What bonds that ever held a human
society happily together , or held it together at all , are in force here ?
It is an unbelieving people ; which has suppositions , hypotheses , and
froth @-@ systems of victorious Analysis ; and for belief this mainly , that
Pleasure is pleasant . Hunger they have for all sweet things ; and the law
of Hunger ; but what other law ? Within them , or over them , properly none !

Their King has become a King Popinjay ; with his Maurepas Government ,
gyrating as the weather @-@ cock does , blown about by every wind . Above
them they see no God ; or they even do not look above , except with
astronomical glasses . The Church indeed still is ; but in the most
submissive state ; quite tamed by Philosophism ; in a singularly short
time ; for the hour was come . Some twenty years ago , your Archbishop
Beaumont would not even let the poor Jansenists get buried : your Lomenie
Brienne ( a rising man , whom we shall meet with yet ) could , in the name
of the Clergy , insist on having the Anti @-@ protestant laws , which condemn
to death for preaching , &apos; put in execution . &apos; ( Boissy d &apos;Anglas , Vie de
Malesherbes , i . 15 @-@ 22 . ) And , alas , now not so much as Baron Holbach &apos;s
Atheism can be burnt , -- except as pipe @-@ matches by the private speculative
individual . Our Church stands haltered , dumb , like a dumb ox ; lowing
only for provender ( of tithes ) ; content if it can have that ; or , dumbly ,
dully expecting its further doom . And the Twenty Millions of &apos; haggard
faces ; &apos; and , as finger @-@ post and guidance to them in their dark struggle ,
&apos;a gallows forty feet high &apos; ! Certainly a singular Golden Age ; with
its Feasts of Morals , its &apos; sweet manners , &apos; its sweet institutions
( institutions douces ) ; betokening nothing but peace among men ! -- Peace ?
O Philosophe @-@ Sentimentalism , what hast thou to do with peace , when thy
mother &apos;s name is Jezebel ? Foul Product of still fouler Corruption , thou
with the corruption art doomed !

Meanwhile it is singular how long the rotten will hold together ,
provided you do not handle it roughly . For whole generations it
continues standing , &apos; with a ghastly affectation of life , &apos; after all life
and truth has fled out of it ; so loth are men to quit their old ways ;
and , conquering indolence and inertia , venture on new . Great truly is
the Actual ; is the Thing that has rescued itself from bottomless deeps
of theory and possibility , and stands there as a definite indisputable
Fact , whereby men do work and live , or once did so . Widely shall men
cleave to that , while it will endure ; and quit it with regret , when it
gives way under them . Rash enthusiast of Change , beware ! Hast thou well
considered all that Habit does in this life of ours ; how all Knowledge
and all Practice hang wondrous over infinite abysses of the Unknown ,
Impracticable ; and our whole being is an infinite abyss , over @-@ arched by
Habit , as by a thin Earth @-@ rind , laboriously built together ?

But if &apos; every man , &apos; as it has been written , &apos; holds confined within him
a mad @-@ man , &apos; what must every Society do ; -- Society , which in its commonest
state is called &apos; the standing miracle of this world &apos; ! &apos; Without such
Earth @-@ rind of Habit , &apos; continues our author , &apos; call it System of Habits ,
in a word , fixed ways of acting and of believing , -- Society would not
exist at all . With such it exists , better or worse . Herein too , in this
its System of Habits , acquired , retained how you will , lies the true
Law @-@ Code and Constitution of a Society ; the only Code , though an
unwritten one which it can in nowise disobey . The thing we call written
Code , Constitution , Form of Government , and the like , what is it but
some miniature image , and solemnly expressed summary of this unwritten
Code ? Is , -- or rather alas , is not ; but only should be , and always tends
to be ! In which latter discrepancy lies struggle without end . &apos; And
now , we add in the same dialect , let but , by ill chance , in such
ever @-@ enduring struggle , -- your &apos; thin Earth @-@ rind &apos; be once broken ! The
fountains of the great deep boil forth ; fire @-@ fountains , enveloping ,
engulfing . Your &apos; Earth @-@ rind &apos; is shattered , swallowed up ; instead of a
green flowery world , there is a waste wild @-@ weltering chaos : -- which has
again , with tumult and struggle , to make itself into a world .

On the other hand , be this conceded : Where thou findest a Lie that
is oppressing thee , extinguish it . Lies exist there only to be
extinguished ; they wait and cry earnestly for extinction . Think well ,
meanwhile , in what spirit thou wilt do it : not with hatred , with
headlong selfish violence ; but in clearness of heart , with holy zeal ,
gently , almost with pity . Thou wouldst not replace such extinct Lie by
a new Lie , which a new Injustice of thy own were ; the parent of still
other Lies ? Whereby the latter end of that business were worse than the
beginning .

So , however , in this world of ours , which has both an indestructible
hope in the Future , and an indestructible tendency to persevere as
in the Past , must Innovation and Conservation wage their perpetual
conflict , as they may and can . Wherein the &apos; daemonic element , &apos; that
lurks in all human things , may doubtless , some once in the
thousand years -- get vent ! But indeed may we not regret that such
conflict , -- which , after all , is but like that classical one
of &apos; hate @-@ filled Amazons with heroic Youths , &apos; and will end in
embraces , -- should usually be so spasmodic ? For Conservation ,
strengthened by that mightiest quality in us , our indolence , sits for
long ages , not victorious only , which she should be ; but tyrannical ,
incommunicative . She holds her adversary as if annihilated ; such
adversary lying , all the while , like some buried Enceladus ; who , to gain
the smallest freedom , must stir a whole Trinacria with it Aetnas .

Wherefore , on the whole , we will honour a Paper Age too ; an Era of hope !
For in this same frightful process of Enceladus Revolt ; when the
task , on which no mortal would willingly enter , has become imperative ,
inevitable , -- is it not even a kindness of Nature that she lures us
forward by cheerful promises , fallacious or not ; and a whole generation
plunges into the Erebus Blackness , lighted on by an Era of Hope ? It
has been well said : &apos; Man is based on Hope ; he has properly no other
possession but Hope ; this habitation of his is named the Place of Hope . &apos;

But now , among French hopes , is not that of old M. de Maurepas one of
the best @-@ grounded ; who hopes that he , by dexterity , shall contrive to

Small care to him is Perfectibility , Progress of the Species , and

Faquinet ( Diminutive of Scoundrel ) &apos; ? In courtier dialect , he is now
named &apos; the Nestor of France ; &apos; such governing Nestor as France has .

At bottom , nevertheless , it might puzzle one to say where the Government
of France , in these days , specially is . In that Chateau of Versailles ,
we have Nestor , King , Queen , ministers and clerks , with paper @-@ bundles
tied in tape : but the Government ? For Government is a thing that
governs , that guides ; and if need be , compels . Visible in France there
is not such a thing . Invisible , inorganic , on the other hand , there is :
in Philosophe saloons , in Oeil @-@ de @-@ Boeuf galleries ; in the tongue of the
babbler , in the pen of the pamphleteer . Her Majesty appearing at the
Opera is applauded ; she returns all radiant with joy . Anon the applauses
wax fainter , or threaten to cease ; she is heavy of heart , the light of
her face has fled . Is Sovereignty some poor Montgolfier ; which , blown
into by the popular wind , grows great and mounts ; or sinks flaccid ,
if the wind be withdrawn ? France was long a &apos; Despotism tempered by
Epigrams ; &apos; and now , it would seem , the Epigrams have get the upper hand .

Happy were a young &apos; Louis the Desired &apos; to make France happy ; if it
did not prove too troublesome , and he only knew the way . But there
is endless discrepancy round him ; so many claims and clamours ; a
mere confusion of tongues . Not reconcilable by man ; not manageable ,
suppressible , save by some strongest and wisest men ; -- which only a
lightly @-@ jesting lightly @-@ gyrating M. de Maurepas can so much as subsist
amidst . Philosophism claims her new Era , meaning thereby innumerable
things . And claims it in no faint voice ; for France at large , hitherto
mute , is now beginning to speak also ; and speaks in that same sense .
A huge , many @-@ toned sound ; distant , yet not unimpressive . On the other
hand , the Oeil @-@ de @-@ Boeuf , which , as nearest , one can hear best , claims
with shrill vehemence that the Monarchy be as heretofore a Horn of
Plenty ; wherefrom loyal courtiers may draw , -- to the just support of
the throne . Let Liberalism and a New Era , if such is the wish , be
introduced ; only no curtailment of the royal moneys ? Which latter
condition , alas , is precisely the impossible one .

Philosophism , as we saw , has got her Turgot made Controller @-@ General ; and
there shall be endless reformation . Unhappily this Turgot could continue
only twenty months . With a miraculous Fortunatus &apos; Purse in his Treasury ,
it might have lasted longer ; with such Purse indeed , every French
Controller @-@ General , that would prosper in these days , ought first to
provide himself . But here again may we not remark the bounty of Nature
in regard to Hope ? Man after man advances confident to the Augean
Stable , as if he could clean it ; expends his little fraction of an
ability on it , with such cheerfulness ; does , in so far as he was honest ,
accomplish something . Turgot has faculties ; honesty , insight ,
heroic volition ; but the Fortunatus &apos; Purse he has not . Sanguine
Controller @-@ General ! a whole pacific French Revolution may stand
schemed in the head of the thinker ; but who shall pay the unspeakable
&apos;indemnities &apos; that will be needed ? Alas , far from that : on the very
threshold of the business , he proposes that the Clergy , the Noblesse ,
the very Parlements be subjected to taxes ! One shriek of indignation
and astonishment reverberates through all the Chateau galleries ; M. de
Maurepas has to gyrate : the poor King , who had written few weeks ago ,
&apos;Il n &apos;y a que vous et moi qui aimions le peuple ( There is none but
you and I that has the people &apos;s interest at heart ) , &apos; must write now
a dismissal ; ( In May , 1776 . ) and let the French Revolution accomplish
itself , pacifically or not , as it can .

Hope , then , is deferred ? Deferred ; not destroyed , or abated . Is not
this , for example , our Patriarch Voltaire , after long years of absence ,
revisiting Paris ? With face shrivelled to nothing ; with &apos; huge peruke a
la Louis Quatorze , which leaves only two eyes &quot; visible &quot; glittering like
carbuncles , &apos; the old man is here . ( February , 1778 . ) What an
outburst ! Sneering Paris has suddenly grown reverent ; devotional with
Hero @-@ worship . Nobles have disguised themselves as tavern @-@ waiters to
obtain sight of him : the loveliest of France would lay their hair
beneath his feet . &apos; His chariot is the nucleus of a comet ; whose train
fills whole streets : &apos; they crown him in the theatre , with immortal
vivats ; &apos; finally stifle him under roses , &apos; -- for old Richelieu recommended
opium in such state of the nerves , and the excessive Patriarch took too
much . Her Majesty herself had some thought of sending for him ; but was
dissuaded . Let Majesty consider it , nevertheless . The purport of this
man &apos;s existence has been to wither up and annihilate all whereon
Majesty and Worship for the present rests : and is it so that the world
recognises him ? With Apotheosis ; as its Prophet and Speaker , who has
spoken wisely the thing it longed to say ? Add only , that the body of
this same rose @-@ stifled , beatified @-@ Patriarch cannot get buried except by
stealth . It is wholly a notable business ; and France , without doubt , is
big ( what the Germans call &apos; Of good Hope &apos; ) : we shall wish her a happy
birth @-@ hour , and blessed fruit .

Beaumarchais too has now winded @-@ up his Law @-@ Pleadings ( Memoires ) ;
( 1773 @-@ 6 . See Oeuvres de Beaumarchais ; where they , and the history of
them , are given . ) not without result , to himself and to the world . Caron
Beaumarchais ( or de Beaumarchais , for he got ennobled ) had been born
poor , but aspiring , esurient ; with talents , audacity , adroitness ; above
all , with the talent for intrigue : a lean , but also a tough , indomitable
man . Fortune and dexterity brought him to the harpsichord of Mesdames ,
our good Princesses Loque , Graille and Sisterhood . Still better , Paris
Duvernier , the Court @-@ Banker , honoured him with some confidence ; to
the length even of transactions in cash . Which confidence , however ,
Duvernier &apos;s Heir , a person of quality , would not continue . Quite
otherwise ; there springs a Lawsuit from it : wherein tough Beaumarchais ,
losing both money and repute , is , in the opinion of Judge @-@ Reporter
Goezman , of the Parlement Maupeou , of a whole indifferent acquiescing
world , miserably beaten . In all men &apos;s opinions , only not in his own !
Inspired by the indignation , which makes , if not verses , satirical
law @-@ papers , the withered Music @-@ master , with a desperate heroism ,
takes up his lost cause in spite of the world ; fights for it , against
Reporters , Parlements and Principalities , with light banter , with clear
logic ; adroitly , with an inexhaustible toughness and resource , like
the skilfullest fencer ; on whom , so skilful is he , the whole world now
looks . Three long years it lasts ; with wavering fortune . In fine , after
labours comparable to the Twelve of Hercules , our unconquerable Caron
triumphs ; regains his Lawsuit and Lawsuits ; strips Reporter Goezman of
the judicial ermine ; covering him with a perpetual garment of obloquy
instead : -- and in regard to the Parlement Maupeou ( which he has helped
to extinguish ) , to Parlements of all kinds , and to French Justice
generally , gives rise to endless reflections in the minds of men . Thus
has Beaumarchais , like a lean French Hercules , ventured down , driven
by destiny , into the Nether Kingdoms ; and victoriously tamed hell @-@ dogs
there . He also is henceforth among the notabilities of his generation .



Chapter 1.2.V.

Astraea Redux without Cash .

Observe , however , beyond the Atlantic , has not the new day verily
dawned ! Democracy , as we said , is born ; storm @-@ girt , is struggling for
life and victory . A sympathetic France rejoices over the Rights of Man ;
in all saloons , it is said , What a spectacle ! Now too behold our Deane ,
our Franklin , American Plenipotentiaries , here in position soliciting ;
( 1777 ; Deane somewhat earlier : Franklin remained till 1785 . ) the sons
of the Saxon Puritans , with their Old @-@ Saxon temper , Old @-@ Hebrew culture ,
sleek Silas , sleek Benjamin , here on such errand , among the light
children of Heathenism , Monarchy , Sentimentalism , and the Scarlet @-@ woman .
A spectacle indeed ; over which saloons may cackle joyous ; though Kaiser
Joseph , questioned on it , gave this answer , most unexpected from a
Philosophe : &quot; Madame , the trade I live by is that of royalist ( Mon metier
a moi c &apos;est d &apos;etre royaliste ) . &quot;

So thinks light Maurepas too ; but the wind of Philosophism and force of
public opinion will blow him round . Best wishes , meanwhile , are sent ;
clandestine privateers armed . Paul Jones shall equip his Bon Homme
Richard : weapons , military stores can be smuggled over ( if the English
do not seize them ) ; wherein , once more Beaumarchais , dimly as the Giant
Smuggler becomes visible , -- filling his own lank pocket withal . But
surely , in any case , France should have a Navy . For which great object
were not now the time : now when that proud Termagant of the Seas has her
hands full ? It is true , an impoverished Treasury cannot build ships ;
but the hint once given ( which Beaumarchais says he gave ) , this and the
other loyal Seaport , Chamber of Commerce , will build and offer them .
Goodly vessels bound into the waters ; a Ville de Paris , Leviathan of
ships .

And now when gratuitous three @-@ deckers dance there at anchor , with
streamers flying ; and eleutheromaniac Philosophedom grows ever more
clamorous , what can a Maurepas do -- but gyrate ? Squadrons cross the
ocean : Gages , Lees , rough Yankee Generals , &apos; with woollen night @-@ caps
under their hats , &apos; present arms to the far @-@ glancing Chivalry of France ;
and new @-@ born Democracy sees , not without amazement , &apos; Despotism tempered
by Epigrams fight at her side . So , however , it is . King &apos;s forces and
heroic volunteers ; Rochambeaus , Bouilles , Lameths , Lafayettes , have
drawn their swords in this sacred quarrel of mankind ; -- shall draw them
again elsewhere , in the strangest way .

Off Ushant some naval thunder is heard . In the course of which did
our young Prince , Duke de Chartres , &apos; hide in the hold ; &apos; or did he
materially , by active heroism , contribute to the victory ? Alas , by a
second edition , we learn that there was no victory ; or that English
Keppel had it . ( 27th July , 1778 . ) Our poor young Prince gets his
Opera plaudits changed into mocking tehees ; and cannot become
Grand @-@ Admiral , -- the source to him of woes which one may call endless .

Woe also for Ville de Paris , the Leviathan of ships ! English Rodney has
clutched it , and led it home , with the rest ; so successful was his new
&apos;manoeuvre of breaking the enemy &apos;s line . &apos; ( 9th and 12th April , 1782 . ) It
seems as if , according to Louis XV . , &apos; France were never to have a Navy . &apos; 
Brave Suffren must return from Hyder Ally and the Indian Waters ; with
small result ; yet with great glory for &apos; six non @-@ defeats ; -- which indeed ,
with such seconding as he had , one may reckon heroic . Let the old
sea @-@ hero rest now , honoured of France , in his native Cevennes mountains ;
send smoke , not of gunpowder , but mere culinary smoke , through the old
chimneys of the Castle of Jales , -- which one day , in other hands ,
shall have other fame . Brave Laperouse shall by and by lift anchor , on
philanthropic Voyage of Discovery ; for the King knows Geography . ( August
1st , 1785 . ) But , alas , this also will not prosper : the brave Navigator
goes , and returns not ; the Seekers search far seas for him in vain .
He has vanished trackless into blue Immensity ; and only some mournful
mysterious shadow of him hovers long in all heads and hearts .

Neither , while the War yet lasts , will Gibraltar surrender . Not though
Crillon , Nassau @-@ Siegen , with the ablest projectors extant , are there ;
and Prince Conde and Prince d &apos;Artois have hastened to help . Wondrous
leather @-@ roofed Floating @-@ batteries , set afloat by French @-@ Spanish Pacte de
Famille , give gallant summons : to which , nevertheless , Gibraltar answers
Plutonically , with mere torrents of redhot iron , -- as if stone Calpe had
become a throat of the Pit ; and utters such a Doom &apos;s @-@ blast of a No ,
as all men must credit . ( Annual Register ( Dodsley &apos;s ) , xxv . 258 @-@ 267 .
September , October , 1782 . )

And so , with this loud explosion , the noise of War has ceased ; an Age
of Benevolence may hope , for ever . Our noble volunteers of Freedom have
returned , to be her missionaries . Lafayette , as the matchless of his
time , glitters in the Versailles Oeil @-@ de @-@ Beouf ; has his Bust set up in
the Paris Hotel @-@ de @-@ Ville . Democracy stands inexpugnable , immeasurable ,
in her New World ; has even a foot lifted towards the Old ; -- and our
French Finances , little strengthened by such work , are in no healthy
way .

What to do with the Finance ? This indeed is the great question : a small
but most black weather @-@ symptom , which no radiance of universal hope
can cover . We saw Turgot cast forth from the Controllership , with
shrieks , -- for want of a Fortunatus &apos; Purse . As little could M. de Clugny
manage the duty ; or indeed do anything , but consume his wages ; attain
&apos;a place in History , &apos; where as an ineffectual shadow thou beholdest him
still lingering ; -- and let the duty manage itself . Did Genevese Necker
possess such a Purse , then ? He possessed banker &apos;s skill , banker &apos;s
honesty ; credit of all kinds , for he had written Academic Prize Essays ,
struggled for India Companies , given dinners to Philosophes , and
&apos;realised a fortune in twenty years . &apos; He possessed , further , a
taciturnity and solemnity ; of depth , or else of dulness . How singular
for Celadon Gibbon , false swain as he had proved ; whose father , keeping
most probably his own gig , &apos; would not hear of such a union , &apos; -- to find
now his forsaken Demoiselle Curchod sitting in the high places of
the world , as Minister &apos;s Madame , and &apos; Necker not jealous ! &apos; ( Gibbon &apos;s
Letters : date , 16th June , 1777 , &amp; c . )

A new young Demoiselle , one day to be famed as a Madame and De Stael ,
was romping about the knees of the Decline and Fall : the lady Necker
founds Hospitals ; gives solemn Philosophe dinner @-@ parties , to cheer her
exhausted Controller @-@ General . Strange things have happened : by
clamour of Philosophism , management of Marquis de Pezay , and Poverty
constraining even Kings . And so Necker , Atlas @-@ like , sustains the burden
of the Finances , for five years long ? ( Till May , 1781 . ) Without wages ,
for he refused such ; cheered only by Public Opinion , and the ministering
of his noble Wife . With many thoughts in him , it is hoped ; -- which ,
however , he is shy of uttering . His Compte Rendu , published by the royal
permission , fresh sign of a New Era , shows wonders ; -- which what but
the genius of some Atlas @-@ Necker can prevent from becoming portents ? In
Necker &apos;s head too there is a whole pacific French Revolution , of its
kind ; and in that taciturn dull depth , or deep dulness , ambition enough .

Meanwhile , alas , his Fotunatus &apos; Purse turns out to be little other than
the old &apos; vectigal of Parsimony . &apos; Nay , he too has to produce his scheme
of taxing : Clergy , Noblesse to be taxed ; Provincial Assemblies , and the
rest , -- like a mere Turgot ! The expiring M. de Maurepas must gyrate one
other time . Let Necker also depart ; not unlamented .

Great in a private station , Necker looks on from the distance ; abiding
his time . &apos; Eighty thousand copies &apos; of his new Book , which he calls
Administration des Finances , will be sold in few days . He is gone ; but
shall return , and that more than once , borne by a whole shouting Nation .
Singular Controller @-@ General of the Finances ; once Clerk in Thelusson &apos;s
Bank !



Chapter 1.2.VI.

Windbags .

So marches the world , in this its Paper Age , or Era of Hope . Not without
obstructions , war @-@ explosions ; which , however , heard from such distance ,
are little other than a cheerful marching @-@ music . If indeed that dark
living chaos of Ignorance and Hunger , five @-@ and @-@ twenty million strong ,
under your feet , -- were to begin playing !

For the present , however , consider Longchamp ; now when Lent is ending ,
and the glory of Paris and France has gone forth , as in annual wont .
Not to assist at Tenebris Masses , but to sun itself and show itself ,
and salute the Young Spring . ( Mercier , Tableau de Paris , ii . 51 . Louvet ,
Roman de Faublas , &amp; c . ) Manifold , bright @-@ tinted , glittering with gold ;
all through the Bois de Boulogne , in longdrawn variegated rows ; -- like
longdrawn living flower @-@ borders , tulips , dahlias , lilies of the valley ;
all in their moving flower @-@ pots ( of new @-@ gilt carriages ) : pleasure of the
eye , and pride of life ! So rolls and dances the Procession : steady , of
firm assurance , as if it rolled on adamant and the foundations of the
world ; not on mere heraldic parchment , -- under which smoulders a lake of
fire . Dance on , ye foolish ones ; ye sought not wisdom , neither have
ye found it . Ye and your fathers have sown the wind , ye shall reap the
whirlwind . Was it not , from of old , written : The wages of sin is death ?

But at Longchamp , as elsewhere , we remark for one thing , that dame and
cavalier are waited on each by a kind of human familiar , named jokei .
Little elf , or imp ; though young , already withered ; with its withered
air of premature vice , of knowingness , of completed elf @-@ hood : useful in
various emergencies . The name jokei ( jockey ) comes from the English ; as
the thing also fancies that it does . Our Anglomania , in fact , is grown
considerable ; prophetic of much . If France is to be free , why shall she
not , now when mad war is hushed , love neighbouring Freedom ? Cultivated
men , your Dukes de Liancourt , de la Rochefoucault admire the English
Constitution , the English National Character ; would import what of it
they can .

Of what is lighter , especially if it be light as wind , how much easier
the freightage ! Non @-@ Admiral Duke de Chartres ( not yet d &apos;Orleans or
Egalite ) flies to and fro across the Strait ; importing English Fashions ;
this he , as hand @-@ and @-@ glove with an English Prince of Wales , is surely
qualified to do . Carriages and saddles ; top @-@ boots and redingotes , as
we call riding @-@ coats . Nay the very mode of riding : for now no man on a
level with his age but will trot a l &apos;Anglaise , rising in the stirrups ;
scornful of the old sitfast method , in which , according to Shakspeare ,
&apos;butter and eggs &apos; go to market . Also , he can urge the fervid wheels ,
this brave Chartres of ours ; no whip in Paris is rasher and surer than
the unprofessional one of Monseigneur .

Elf jokeis , we have seen ; but see now real Yorkshire jockeys , and what
they ride on , and train : English racers for French Races . These likewise
we owe first ( under the Providence of the Devil ) to Monseigneur . Prince
d &apos;Artois also has his stud of racers . Prince d &apos;Artois has withal
the strangest horseleech : a moonstruck , much @-@ enduring individual ,
of Neuchatel in Switzerland , -- named Jean Paul Marat . A problematic
Chevalier d &apos;Eon , now in petticoats , now in breeches , is no less
problematic in London than in Paris ; and causes bets and lawsuits .
Beautiful days of international communion ! Swindlery and Blackguardism
have stretched hands across the Channel , and saluted mutually : on the
racecourse of Vincennes or Sablons , behold in English curricle @-@ and @-@ four ,
wafted glorious among the principalities and rascalities , an English Dr.
Dodd , ( Adelung , Geschichte der Menschlichen Narrheit , para Dodd . ) -- for
whom also the too early gallows gapes .

Duke de Chartres was a young Prince of great promise , as young Princes
often are ; which promise unfortunately has belied itself . With the huge
Orleans Property , with Duke de Penthievre for Father @-@ in @-@ law ( and now the
young Brother @-@ in @-@ law Lamballe killed by excesses ) , -- he will one day be
the richest man in France . Meanwhile , &apos; his hair is all falling out ,
his blood is quite spoiled , &apos; -- by early transcendentalism of debauchery .
Carbuncles stud his face ; dark studs on a ground of burnished copper . A
most signal failure , this young Prince ! The stuff prematurely burnt out
of him : little left but foul smoke and ashes of expiring sensualities :
what might have been Thought , Insight , and even Conduct , gone now , or
fast going , -- to confused darkness , broken by bewildering dazzlements ; to
obstreperous crotchets ; to activities which you may call semi @-@ delirious ,
or even semi @-@ galvanic ! Paris affects to laugh at his charioteering ; but
he heeds not such laughter .

On the other hand , what a day , not of laughter , was that , when
he threatened , for lucre &apos;s sake , to lay sacrilegious hand on
the Palais @-@ Royal Garden ! ( 1781 @-@ 82 . ( Dulaure , viii . 423 . ) ) The
flower @-@ parterres shall be riven up ; the Chestnut Avenues shall fall :
time @-@ honoured boscages , under which the Opera Hamadryads were wont to
wander , not inexorable to men . Paris moans aloud . Philidor , from his
Cafe de la Regence , shall no longer look on greenness ; the loungers and
losels of the world , where now shall they haunt ? In vain is moaning . The
axe glitters ; the sacred groves fall crashing , -- for indeed Monseigneur
was short of money : the Opera Hamadryads fly with shrieks . Shriek not ,
ye Opera Hamadryads ; or not as those that have no comfort . He will
surround your Garden with new edifices and piazzas : though narrowed , it
shall be replanted ; dizened with hydraulic jets , cannon which the sun
fires at noon ; things bodily , things spiritual , such as man has not
imagined ; -- and in the Palais @-@ Royal shall again , and more than ever , be
the Sorcerer &apos;s Sabbath and Satan @-@ at @-@ Home of our Planet .

What will not mortals attempt ? From remote Annonay in the Vivarais , the
Brothers Montgolfier send up their paper @-@ dome , filled with the smoke of
burnt wool . ( 5th June , 1783 . ) The Vivarais provincial assembly is to
be prorogued this same day : Vivarais Assembly @-@ members applaud , and
the shouts of congregated men . Will victorious Analysis scale the very
Heavens , then ?

Paris hears with eager wonder ; Paris shall ere long see . From
Reveilion &apos;s Paper @-@ warehouse there , in the Rue St. Antoine ( a noted
Warehouse ) , -- the new Montgolfier air @-@ ship launches itself . Ducks and
poultry are borne skyward : but now shall men be borne . ( October and
November , 1783 . ) Nay , Chemist Charles thinks of hydrogen and glazed
silk . Chemist Charles will himself ascend , from the Tuileries Garden ;
Montgolfier solemnly cutting the cord . By Heaven , he also mounts , he and
another ? Ten times ten thousand hearts go palpitating ; all tongues are
mute with wonder and fear ; till a shout , like the voice of seas , rolls
after him , on his wild way . He soars , he dwindles upwards ; has become
a mere gleaming circlet , -- like some Turgotine snuff @-@ box , what we call
&apos;Turgotine Platitude ; &apos; like some new daylight Moon ! Finally he descends ;
welcomed by the universe . Duchess Polignac , with a party , is in the Bois
de Boulogne , waiting ; though it is drizzly winter ; the 1st of December
1783 . The whole chivalry of France , Duke de Chartres foremost , gallops
to receive him . ( Lacretelle , 18me Siecle , iii . 258 . )

Beautiful invention ; mounting heavenward , so beautifully , -- so
unguidably ! Emblem of much , and of our Age of Hope itself ; which
shall mount , specifically @-@ light , majestically in this same manner ; and
hover , -- tumbling whither Fate will . Well if it do not , Pilatre @-@ like ,
explode ; and demount all the more tragically ! -- So , riding on windbags ,
will men scale the Empyrean .

Or observe Herr Doctor Mesmer , in his spacious Magnetic Halls .
Long @-@ stoled he walks ; reverend , glancing upwards , as in rapt commerce ;
an Antique Egyptian Hierophant in this new age . Soft music flits ;
breaking fitfully the sacred stillness . Round their Magnetic Mystery ,
which to the eye is mere tubs with water , -- sit breathless , rod in
hand , the circles of Beauty and Fashion , each circle a living circular
Passion @-@ Flower : expecting the magnetic afflatus , and new @-@ manufactured
Heaven @-@ on @-@ Earth . O women , O men , great is your infidel @-@ faith ! A
Parlementary Duport , a Bergasse , D &apos;Espremenil we notice there ; Chemist
Berthollet too , -- on the part of Monseigneur de Chartres .

Had not the Academy of Sciences , with its Baillys , Franklins ,
Lavoisiers , interfered ! But it did interfere . ( Lacretelle , 18me Siecle ,
iii.258. ) Mesmer may pocket his hard money , and withdraw . Let him walk
silent by the shore of the Bodensee , by the ancient town of Constance ;
meditating on much . For so , under the strangest new vesture , the old
great truth ( since no vesture can hide it ) begins again to be revealed :
That man is what we call a miraculous creature , with miraculous power
over men ; and , on the whole , with such a Life in him , and such a
World round him , as victorious Analysis , with her Physiologies ,
Nervous @-@ systems , Physic and Metaphysic , will never completely name , to
say nothing of explaining . Wherein also the Quack shall , in all ages ,
come in for his share . ( August , 1784 . )



Chapter 1.2.VII.

Contrat Social .

In such succession of singular prismatic tints , flush after flush
suffusing our horizon , does the Era of Hope dawn on towards fulfilment .
Questionable ! As indeed , with an Era of Hope that rests on mere
universal Benevolence , victorious Analysis , Vice cured of its deformity ;
and , in the long run , on Twenty @-@ five dark savage Millions , looking
up , in hunger and weariness , to that Ecce @-@ signum of theirs &apos; forty feet
high , &apos; -- how could it but be questionable ?

Through all time , if we read aright , sin was , is , will be , the parent
of misery . This land calls itself most Christian , and has crosses
and cathedrals ; but its High @-@ priest is some Roche @-@ Aymon , some
Necklace @-@ Cardinal Louis de Rohan . The voice of the poor , through long
years , ascends inarticulate , in Jacqueries , meal @-@ mobs ; low @-@ whimpering
of infinite moan : unheeded of the Earth ; not unheeded of Heaven . Always
moreover where the Millions are wretched , there are the Thousands
straitened , unhappy ; only the Units can flourish ; or say rather , be
ruined the last . Industry , all noosed and haltered , as if it too were
some beast of chase for the mighty hunters of this world to bait , and
cut slices from , -- cries passionately to these its well @-@ paid guides and
watchers , not , Guide me ; but , Laissez faire , Leave me alone of your
guidance ! What market has Industry in this France ? For two things there
may be market and demand : for the coarser kind of field @-@ fruits , since
the Millions will live : for the fine kinds of luxury and spicery , -- of
multiform taste , from opera @-@ melodies down to racers and courtesans ;
since the Units will be amused . It is at bottom but a mad state of
things .

To mend and remake all which we have , indeed , victorious Analysis .
Honour to victorious Analysis ; nevertheless , out of the Workshop and
Laboratory , what thing was victorious Analysis yet known to make ?
Detection of incoherences , mainly ; destruction of the incoherent . From
of old , Doubt was but half a magician ; she evokes the spectres which she
cannot quell . We shall have &apos; endless vortices of froth @-@ logic ; &apos; whereon
first words , and then things , are whirled and swallowed . Remark ,
accordingly , as acknowledged grounds of Hope , at bottom mere precursors
of Despair , this perpetual theorising about Man , the Mind of Man ,
Philosophy of Government , Progress of the Species and such @-@ like ; the
main thinking furniture of every head . Time , and so many Montesquieus ,
Mablys , spokesmen of Time , have discovered innumerable things : and now
has not Jean Jacques promulgated his new Evangel of a Contrat Social ;
explaining the whole mystery of Government , and how it is contracted and
bargained for , -- to universal satisfaction ? Theories of Government ! Such
have been , and will be ; in ages of decadence . Acknowledge them in their
degree ; as processes of Nature , who does nothing in vain ; as steps in
her great process . Meanwhile , what theory is so certain as this , That
all theories , were they never so earnest , painfully elaborated , are ,
and , by the very conditions of them , must be incomplete , questionable ,
and even false ? Thou shalt know that this Universe is , what it professes
to be , an infinite one . Attempt not to swallow it , for thy logical
digestion ; be thankful , if skilfully planting down this and the other
fixed pillar in the chaos , thou prevent its swallowing thee . That a new
young generation has exchanged the Sceptic Creed , What shall I believe ?
for passionate Faith in this Gospel according to Jean Jacques is a
further step in the business ; and betokens much .

Blessed also is Hope ; and always from the beginning there was some
Millennium prophesied ; Millennium of Holiness ; but ( what is notable )
never till this new Era , any Millennium of mere Ease and plentiful
Supply . In such prophesied Lubberland , of Happiness , Benevolence , and
Vice cured of its deformity , trust not , my friends ! Man is not what one
calls a happy animal ; his appetite for sweet victual is so enormous .
How , in this wild Universe , which storms in on him , infinite ,
vague @-@ menacing , shall poor man find , say not happiness , but existence ,
and footing to stand on , if it be not by girding himself together for
continual endeavour and endurance ? Woe , if in his heart there dwelt no
devout Faith ; if the word Duty had lost its meaning for him ! For as to
this of Sentimentalism , so useful for weeping with over romances and on
pathetic occasions , it otherwise verily will avail nothing ; nay less .
The healthy heart that said to itself , &apos; How healthy am I ! &apos; was already
fallen into the fatalest sort of disease . Is not Sentimentalism
twin @-@ sister to Cant , if not one and the same with it ? Is not Cant the
materia prima of the Devil ; from which all falsehoods , imbecilities ,
abominations body themselves ; from which no true thing can come ? For
Cant is itself properly a double @-@ distilled Lie ; the second @-@ power of a
Lie .

And now if a whole Nation fall into that ? In such case , I answer ,
infallibly they will return out of it ! For life is no cunningly @-@ devised
deception or self @-@ deception : it is a great truth that thou art alive ,
that thou hast desires , necessities ; neither can these subsist and
satisfy themselves on delusions , but on fact . To fact , depend on it , we
shall come back : to such fact , blessed or cursed , as we have wisdom
for . The lowest , least blessed fact one knows of , on which necessitous
mortals have ever based themselves , seems to be the primitive one of
Cannibalism : That I can devour Thee . What if such Primitive Fact were
precisely the one we had ( with our improved methods ) to revert to , and
begin anew from !

Printed Paper .

In such a practical France , let the theory of Perfectibility say what
it will , discontents cannot be wanting : your promised Reformation is
so indispensable ; yet it comes not ; who will begin it -- with himself ?
Discontent with what is around us , still more with what is above us ,
goes on increasing ; seeking ever new vents .

Of Street Ballads , of Epigrams that from of old tempered Despotism , we
need not speak . Nor of Manuscript Newspapers ( Nouvelles a la main ) do
we speak . Bachaumont and his journeymen and followers may close those
&apos;thirty volumes of scurrilous eaves @-@ dropping , &apos; and quit that trade ; for
at length if not liberty of the Press , there is license . Pamphlets can
be surreptititiously vended and read in Paris , did they even bear to
be &apos; Printed at Pekin . &apos; We have a Courrier de l &apos;Europe in those years ,
regularly published at London ; by a De Morande , whom the guillotine has
not yet devoured . There too an unruly Linguet , still unguillotined , when
his own country has become too hot for him , and his brother Advocates
have cast him out , can emit his hoarse wailings , and Bastille Devoilee
( Bastille unveiled ) . Loquacious Abbe Raynal , at length , has his wish ;
sees the Histoire Philosophique , with its &apos; lubricity , &apos; unveracity , loose
loud eleutheromaniac rant ( contributed , they say , by Philosophedom at
large , though in the Abbe &apos;s name , and to his glory ) , burnt by the common
hangman ; -- and sets out on his travels as a martyr . It was the edition of
1781 ; perhaps the last notable book that had such fire @-@ beatitude , -- the
hangman discovering now that it did not serve .

Again , in Courts of Law , with their money @-@ quarrels , divorce @-@ cases ,
wheresoever a glimpse into the household existence can be had , what
indications ! The Parlements of Besancon and Aix ring , audible to all
France , with the amours and destinies of a young Mirabeau . He , under
the nurture of a &apos; Friend of Men , &apos; has , in State Prisons , in marching
Regiments , Dutch Authors &apos; garrets , and quite other scenes , &apos; been for
twenty years learning to resist &apos; despotism : &apos; despotism of men , and
alas also of gods . How , beneath this rose @-@ coloured veil of Universal
Benevolence and Astraea Redux , is the sanctuary of Home so often a
dreary void , or a dark contentious Hell @-@ on @-@ Earth ! The old Friend of Men
has his own divorce case too ; and at times , &apos; his whole family but one&apos;
under lock and key : he writes much about reforming and enfranchising
the world ; and for his own private behoof he has needed sixty
Lettres @-@ de @-@ Cachet . A man of insight too , with resolution , even with
manful principle : but in such an element , inward and outward ; which he
could not rule , but only madden . Edacity , rapacity ; -- quite contrary to
the finer sensibilities of the heart ! Fools , that expect your verdant
Millennium , and nothing but Love and Abundance , brooks running wine ,
winds whispering music , -- with the whole ground and basis of your
existence champed into a mud of Sensuality ; which , daily growing deeper ,
will soon have no bottom but the Abyss !

Or consider that unutterable business of the Diamond Necklace .
Red @-@ hatted Cardinal Louis de Rohan ; Sicilian jail @-@ bird Balsamo
Cagliostro ; milliner Dame de Lamotte , &apos; with a face of some piquancy : &apos;
the highest Church Dignitaries waltzing , in Walpurgis Dance , with
quack @-@ prophets , pickpurses and public women ; -- a whole Satan &apos;s Invisible
World displayed ; working there continually under the daylight visible
one ; the smoke of its torment going up for ever ! The Throne has been
brought into scandalous collision with the Treadmill . Astonished Europe
rings with the mystery for ten months ; sees only lie unfold itself
from lie ; corruption among the lofty and the low , gulosity , credulity ,
imbecility , strength nowhere but in the hunger . Weep , fair Queen , thy
first tears of unmixed wretchedness ! Thy fair name has been tarnished by
foul breath ; irremediably while life lasts . No more shalt thou be loved
and pitied by living hearts , till a new generation has been born ,
and thy own heart lies cold , cured of all its sorrows . -- The Epigrams
henceforth become , not sharp and bitter ; but cruel , atrocious ,
unmentionable . On that 31st of May , 1786 , a miserable Cardinal
Grand @-@ Almoner Rohan , on issuing from his Bastille , is escorted by
hurrahing crowds : unloved he , and worthy of no love ; but important
since the Court and Queen are his enemies . ( Fils Adoptif , Memoires de
Mirabeau , iv . 325 . )

How is our bright Era of Hope dimmed : and the whole sky growing bleak
with signs of hurricane and earthquake ! It is a doomed world : gone all
&apos;obedience that made men free ; &apos; fast going the obedience that made men
slaves , -- at least to one another . Slaves only of their own lusts they
now are , and will be . Slaves of sin ; inevitably also of sorrow . Behold
the mouldering mass of Sensuality and Falsehood ; round which
plays foolishly , itself a corrupt phosphorescence , some glimmer of
Sentimentalism ; -- and over all , rising , as Ark of their Covenant , the
grim Patibulary Fork &apos; forty feet high ; &apos; which also is now nigh rotted .
Add only that the French Nation distinguishes itself among Nations by
the characteristic of Excitability ; with the good , but also with the
perilous evil , which belongs to that . Rebellion , explosion , of unknown
extent is to be calculated on . There are , as Chesterfield wrote , &apos; all
the symptoms I have ever met with in History ! &apos;

Shall we say , then : Wo to Philosophism , that it destroyed Religion , what
it called &apos; extinguishing the abomination ( ecraser &apos; l &apos;infame ) &apos; ? Wo rather
to those that made the Holy an abomination , and extinguishable ; wo
at all men that live in such a time of world @-@ abomination and
world @-@ destruction ! Nay , answer the Courtiers , it was Turgot , it was
Necker , with their mad innovating ; it was the Queen &apos;s want of etiquette ;
it was he , it was she , it was that . Friends ! it was every scoundrel that
had lived , and quack @-@ like pretended to be doing , and been only eating
and misdoing , in all provinces of life , as Shoeblack or as Sovereign
Lord , each in his degree , from the time of Charlemagne and earlier .
All this ( for be sure no falsehood perishes , but is as seed sown out
to grow ) has been storing itself for thousands of years ; and now the
account @-@ day has come . And rude will the settlement be : of wrath laid up
against the day of wrath . O my Brother , be not thou a Quack ! Die rather ,
if thou wilt take counsel ; &apos; tis but dying once , and thou art quit of it
for ever . Cursed is that trade ; and bears curses , thou knowest not how ,
long ages after thou art departed , and the wages thou hadst are all
consumed ; nay , as the ancient wise have written , -- through Eternity
itself , and is verily marked in the Doom @-@ Book of a God !

Hope deferred maketh the heart sick . And yet , as we said , Hope is
but deferred ; not abolished , not abolishable . It is very notable , and
touching , how this same Hope does still light onwards the French Nation
through all its wild destinies . For we shall still find Hope shining , be
it for fond invitation , be it for anger and menace ; as a mild heavenly
light it shone ; as a red conflagration it shines : burning sulphurous
blue , through darkest regions of Terror , it still shines ; and goes sent
out at all , since Desperation itself is a kind of Hope . Thus is our Era
still to be named of Hope , though in the saddest sense , -- when there is
nothing left but Hope .

But if any one would know summarily what a Pandora &apos;s Box lies there for
the opening , he may see it in what by its nature is the symptom of all
symptoms , the surviving Literature of the Period . Abbe Raynal , with
his lubricity and loud loose rant , has spoken his word ; and already the
fast @-@ hastening generation responds to another . Glance at Beaumarchais&apos;
Mariage de Figaro ; which now ( in 1784 ) , after difficulty enough , has
issued on the stage ; and &apos; runs its hundred nights , &apos; to the admiration of
all men . By what virtue or internal vigour it so ran , the reader of our
day will rather wonder : -- and indeed will know so much the better that
it flattered some pruriency of the time ; that it spoke what all were
feeling , and longing to speak . Small substance in that Figaro : thin
wiredrawn intrigues , thin wiredrawn sentiments and sarcasms ; a thing
lean , barren ; yet which winds and whisks itself , as through a wholly
mad universe , adroitly , with a high @-@ sniffing air : wherein each , as was
hinted , which is the grand secret , may see some image of himself , and
of his own state and ways . So it runs its hundred nights , and all France
runs with it ; laughing applause . If the soliloquising Barber ask : &quot; What
has your Lordship done to earn all this ? &quot; and can only answer : &quot; You took
the trouble to be born ( Vous vous etes donne la peine de naitre ) , &quot; all
men must laugh : and a gay horse @-@ racing Anglomaniac Noblesse loudest of
all . For how can small books have a great danger in them ? asks the Sieur
Caron ; and fancies his thin epigram may be a kind of reason . Conqueror
of a golden fleece , by giant smuggling ; tamer of hell @-@ dogs , in the
Parlement Maupeou ; and finally crowned Orpheus in the Theatre Francais ,
Beaumarchais has now culminated , and unites the attributes of several
demigods . We shall meet him once again , in the course of his decline .

Still more significant are two Books produced on the eve of the
ever @-@ memorable Explosion itself , and read eagerly by all the world :
Saint @-@ Pierre &apos;s Paul et Virginie , and Louvet &apos;s Chevalier de Faublas .
Noteworthy Books ; which may be considered as the last speech of old
Feudal France . In the first there rises melodiously , as it were ,
the wail of a moribund world : everywhere wholesome Nature in unequal
conflict with diseased perfidious Art ; cannot escape from it in the
lowest hut , in the remotest island of the sea . Ruin and death must
strike down the loved one ; and , what is most significant of all , death
even here not by necessity , but by etiquette . What a world of prurient
corruption lies visible in that super @-@ sublime of modesty ! Yet , on the
whole , our good Saint @-@ Pierre is musical , poetical though most morbid : we
will call his Book the swan @-@ song of old dying France .

Louvet &apos;s again , let no man account musical . Truly , if this wretched
Faublas is a death @-@ speech , it is one under the gallows , and by a felon
that does not repent . Wretched cloaca of a Book ; without depth even as
a cloaca ! What &apos; picture of French society &apos; is here ? Picture properly of
nothing , if not of the mind that gave it out as some sort of picture .
Yet symptom of much ; above all , of the world that could nourish itself
thereon .

THE PARLEMENT OF PARIS


Chapter 1.3.I.

Dishonoured Bills .

While the unspeakable confusion is everywhere weltering within , and
through so many cracks in the surface sulphur @-@ smoke is issuing , the
question arises : Through what crevice will the main Explosion carry
itself ? Through which of the old craters or chimneys ; or must it , at
once , form a new crater for itself ? In every Society are such chimneys ,
are Institutions serving as such : even Constantinople is not without its
safety @-@ valves ; there too Discontent can vent itself , -- in material fire ;
by the number of nocturnal conflagrations , or of hanged bakers , the
Reigning Power can read the signs of the times , and change course
according to these .

We may say that this French Explosion will doubtless first try all the
old Institutions of escape ; for by each of these there is , or at least
there used to be , some communication with the interior deep ; they are
national Institutions in virtue of that . Had they even become personal
Institutions , and what we can call choked up from their original uses ,
there nevertheless must the impediment be weaker than elsewhere . Through
which of them then ? An observer might have guessed : Through the Law
Parlements ; above all , through the Parlement of Paris .


Men , though never so thickly clad in dignities , sit not inaccessible to
the influences of their time ; especially men whose life is business ;
who at all turns , were it even from behind judgment @-@ seats , have come
in contact with the actual workings of the world . The Counsellor of
Parlement , the President himself , who has bought his place with hard
money that he might be looked up to by his fellow @-@ creatures , how shall
he , in all Philosophe @-@ soirees , and saloons of elegant culture , become
notable as a Friend of Darkness ? Among the Paris Long @-@ robes there may
be more than one patriotic Malesherbes , whose rule is conscience and the
public good ; there are clearly more than one hotheaded D &apos;Espremenil , to
whose confused thought any loud reputation of the Brutus sort may seem
glorious . The Lepelletiers , Lamoignons have titles and wealth ; yet , at
Court , are only styled &apos; Noblesse of the Robe . &apos; There are Duports of deep
scheme ; Freteaus , Sabatiers , of incontinent tongue : all nursed more or
less on the milk of the Contrat Social . Nay , for the whole Body , is not
this patriotic opposition also a fighting for oneself ? Awake , Parlement
of Paris , renew thy long warfare ! Was not the Parlement Maupeou
abolished with ignominy ? Not now hast thou to dread a Louis XIV . , with
the crack of his whip , and his Olympian looks ; not now a Richelieu and
Bastilles : no , the whole Nation is behind thee . Thou too ( O heavens ! )
mayest become a Political Power ; and with the shakings of thy horse @-@ hair
wig shake principalities and dynasties , like a very Jove with his
ambrosial curls !

Light old M. de Maurepas , since the end of 1781 , has been fixed in the
frost of death : &quot; Never more , &quot; said the good Louis , &quot; shall I hear his
step overhead ; &quot; his light jestings and gyratings are at an end . No more
can the importunate reality be hidden by pleasant wit , and today &apos;s evil
be deftly rolled over upon tomorrow . The morrow itself has arrived ; and
now nothing but a solid phlegmatic M. de Vergennes sits there , in dull
matter of fact , like some dull punctual Clerk ( which he originally was ) ;
admits what cannot be denied , let the remedy come whence it will . In
him is no remedy ; only clerklike &apos; despatch of business &apos; according to
routine . The poor King , grown older yet hardly more experienced , must
himself , with such no @-@ faculty as he has , begin governing ; wherein also
his Queen will give help . Bright Queen , with her quick clear glances
and impulses ; clear , and even noble ; but all too superficial ,
vehement @-@ shallow , for that work ! To govern France were such a
problem ; and now it has grown well @-@ nigh too hard to govern even the
Oeil @-@ de @-@ Boeuf . For if a distressed People has its cry , so likewise ,
and more audibly , has a bereaved Court . To the Oeil @-@ de @-@ Boeuf it remains
inconceivable how , in a France of such resources , the Horn of Plenty
should run dry : did it not use to flow ? Nevertheless Necker , with his
revenue of parsimony , has &apos; suppressed above six hundred places , &apos; before
the Courtiers could oust him ; parsimonious finance @-@ pedant as he was .
Again , a military pedant , Saint @-@ Germain , with his Prussian manoeuvres ;
with his Prussian notions , as if merit and not coat @-@ of @-@ arms should be
the rule of promotion , has disaffected military men ; the Mousquetaires ,
with much else are suppressed : for he too was one of your suppressors ;
and unsettling and oversetting , did mere mischief -- to the Oeil @-@ de @-@ Boeuf .
Complaints abound ; scarcity , anxiety : it is a changed Oeil @-@ de @-@ Boeuf .
Besenval says , already in these years ( 1781 ) there was such a melancholy
( such a tristesse ) about Court , compared with former days , as made it
quite dispiriting to look upon .

No wonder that the Oeil @-@ de @-@ Boeuf feels melancholy , when you are
suppressing its places ! Not a place can be suppressed , but some purse is
the lighter for it ; and more than one heart the heavier ; for did it
not employ the working @-@ classes too , -- manufacturers , male and female ,
of laces , essences ; of Pleasure generally , whosoever could manufacture
Pleasure ? Miserable economies ; never felt over Twenty @-@ five Millions !
So , however , it goes on : and is not yet ended . Few years more and the
Wolf @-@ hounds shall fall suppressed , the Bear @-@ hounds , the Falconry ; places
shall fall , thick as autumnal leaves . Duke de Polignac demonstrates , to
the complete silencing of ministerial logic , that his place cannot be
abolished ; then gallantly , turning to the Queen , surrenders it , since
her Majesty so wishes . Less chivalrous was Duke de Coigny , and yet not
luckier : &quot; We got into a real quarrel , Coigny and I , &quot; said King Louis ;
&quot; but if he had even struck me , I could not have blamed him . &quot; ( Besenval ,
iii . 255 @-@ 58 . ) In regard to such matters there can be but one opinion .
Baron Besenval , with that frankness of speech which stamps the
independent man , plainly assures her Majesty that it is frightful
( affreux ) ; &quot; you go to bed , and are not sure but you shall rise
impoverished on the morrow : one might as well be in Turkey . &quot; It is
indeed a dog &apos;s life .

How singular this perpetual distress of the royal treasury ! And yet it
is a thing not more incredible than undeniable . A thing mournfully true :
the stumbling @-@ block on which all Ministers successively stumble , and
fall . Be it &apos; want of fiscal genius , &apos; or some far other want , there is
the palpablest discrepancy between Revenue and Expenditure ; a Deficit
of the Revenue : you must &apos; choke ( combler ) the Deficit , &apos; or else it will
swallow you ! This is the stern problem ; hopeless seemingly as squaring
of the circle . Controller Joly de Fleury , who succeeded Necker , could
do nothing with it ; nothing but propose loans , which were tardily filled
up ; impose new taxes , unproductive of money , productive of clamour and
discontent . As little could Controller d &apos;Ormesson do , or even less ; for
if Joly maintained himself beyond year and day , d &apos;Ormesson reckons only
by months : till &apos; the King purchased Rambouillet without consulting him , &apos;
which he took as a hint to withdraw . And so , towards the end of 1783,
matters threaten to come to still @-@ stand . Vain seems human ingenuity .
In vain has our newly @-@ devised &apos; Council of Finances &apos; struggled , our
Intendants of Finance , Controller @-@ General of Finances : there are
unhappily no Finances to control . Fatal paralysis invades the social
movement ; clouds , of blindness or of blackness , envelop us : are we
breaking down , then , into the black horrors of NATIONAL BANKRUPTCY ?

Great is Bankruptcy : the great bottomless gulf into which all
Falsehoods , public and private , do sink , disappearing ; whither , from the
first origin of them , they were all doomed . For Nature is true and not
a lie . No lie you can speak or act but it will come , after longer or
shorter circulation , like a Bill drawn on Nature &apos;s Reality , and be
presented there for payment , -- with the answer , No effects . Pity only
that it often had so long a circulation : that the original forger were
so seldom he who bore the final smart of it ! Lies , and the burden of
evil they bring , are passed on ; shifted from back to back , and from rank
to rank ; and so land ultimately on the dumb lowest rank , who with spade
and mattock , with sore heart and empty wallet , daily come in contact
with reality , and can pass the cheat no further .

Observe nevertheless how , by a just compensating law , if the lie with
its burden ( in this confused whirlpool of Society ) sinks and is shifted
ever downwards , then in return the distress of it rises ever upwards
and upwards . Whereby , after the long pining and demi @-@ starvation of those
Twenty Millions , a Duke de Coigny and his Majesty come also to have
their &apos; real quarrel . &apos; Such is the law of just Nature ; bringing , though
at long intervals , and were it only by Bankruptcy , matters round again
to the mark .

But with a Fortunatus &apos; Purse in his pocket , through what length of
time might not almost any Falsehood last ! Your Society , your Household ,
practical or spiritual Arrangement , is untrue , unjust , offensive to the
eye of God and man . Nevertheless its hearth is warm , its larder well
replenished : the innumerable Swiss of Heaven , with a kind of Natural
loyalty , gather round it ; will prove , by pamphleteering , musketeering ,
that it is a truth ; or if not an unmixed ( unearthly , impossible ) Truth ,
then better , a wholesomely attempered one , ( as wind is to the shorn
lamb ) , and works well . Changed outlook , however , when purse and larder
grow empty ! Was your Arrangement so true , so accordant to Nature &apos;s ways ,
then how , in the name of wonder , has Nature , with her infinite bounty ,
come to leave it famishing there ? To all men , to all women and all
children , it is now indutiable that your Arrangement was false . Honour
to Bankruptcy ; ever righteous on the great scale , though in detail it
is so cruel ! Under all Falsehoods it works , unweariedly mining . No
Falsehood , did it rise heaven @-@ high and cover the world , but Bankruptcy ,
one day , will sweep it down , and make us free of it .



Chapter 1.3.II.

Controller Calonne .

Under such circumstances of tristesse , obstruction and sick langour ,
when to an exasperated Court it seems as if fiscal genius had departed
from among men , what apparition could be welcomer than that of M. de
Calonne ? Calonne , a man of indisputable genius ; even fiscal genius , more
or less ; of experience both in managing Finance and Parlements , for he
has been Intendant at Metz , at Lille ; King &apos;s Procureur at Douai . A man
of weight , connected with the moneyed classes ; of unstained name , -- if
it were not some peccadillo ( of showing a Client &apos;s Letter ) in that
old D &apos;Aiguillon @-@ Lachalotais business , as good as forgotten now . He
has kinsmen of heavy purse , felt on the Stock Exchange . Our Foulons ,
Berthiers intrigue for him : -- old Foulon , who has now nothing to do but
intrigue ; who is known and even seen to be what they call a scoundrel ;
but of unmeasured wealth ; who , from Commissariat @-@ clerk which he once
was , may hope , some think , if the game go right , to be Minister himself
one day .

Such propping and backing has M. de Calonne ; and then intrinsically such
qualities ! Hope radiates from his face ; persuasion hangs on his tongue .
For all straits he has present remedy , and will make the world roll
on wheels before him . On the 3d of November 1783 , the Oeil @-@ de @-@ Boeuf
rejoices in its new Controller @-@ General . Calonne also shall have trial ;
Calonne also , in his way , as Turgot and Necker had done in theirs , shall
forward the consummation ; suffuse , with one other flush of brilliancy ,
our now too leaden @-@ coloured Era of Hope , and wind it up -- into
fulfilment .

Great , in any case , is the felicity of the Oeil @-@ de @-@ Boeuf . Stinginess has
fled from these royal abodes : suppression ceases ; your Besenval may
go peaceably to sleep , sure that he shall awake unplundered . Smiling
Plenty , as if conjured by some enchanter , has returned ; scatters
contentment from her new @-@ flowing horn . And mark what suavity of manners !
A bland smile distinguishes our Controller : to all men he listens with
an air of interest , nay of anticipation ; makes their own wish clear to
themselves , and grants it ; or at least , grants conditional promise
of it . &quot; I fear this is a matter of difficulty , &quot; said her
Majesty . -- &quot; Madame , &quot; answered the Controller , &quot; if it is but difficult , it
is done , if it is impossible , it shall be done ( se fera ) . &quot; A man of such
&apos;facility &apos; withal . To observe him in the pleasure @-@ vortex of society ,
which none partakes of with more gusto , you might ask , When does he
work ? And yet his work , as we see , is never behindhand ; above all , the
fruit of his work : ready @-@ money . Truly a man of incredible facility ;
facile action , facile elocution , facile thought : how , in mild suasion ,
philosophic depth sparkles up from him , as mere wit and lambent
sprightliness ; and in her Majesty &apos;s Soirees , with the weight of a world
lying on him , he is the delight of men and women ! By what magic does he
accomplish miracles ? By the only true magic , that of genius . Men name
him &apos; the Minister ; &apos; as indeed , when was there another such ? Crooked
things are become straight by him , rough places plain ; and over the
Oeil @-@ de @-@ Boeuf there rests an unspeakable sunshine .

Nay , in seriousness , let no man say that Calonne had not genius : genius
for Persuading ; before all things , for Borrowing . With the skilfulest
judicious appliances of underhand money , he keeps the Stock @-@ Exchanges
flourishing ; so that Loan after Loan is filled up as soon as opened .
&apos;Calculators likely to know &apos; ( Besenval , iii . 216 . ) have calculated that
he spent , in extraordinaries , &apos; at the rate of one million daily ; &apos; which
indeed is some fifty thousand pounds sterling : but did he not procure
something with it ; namely peace and prosperity , for the time being ?
Philosophedom grumbles and croaks ; buys , as we said , 80,000 copies of
Necker &apos;s new Book : but Nonpareil Calonne , in her Majesty &apos;s Apartment ,
with the glittering retinue of Dukes , Duchesses , and mere happy admiring
faces , can let Necker and Philosophedom croak .

The misery is , such a time cannot last ! Squandering , and Payment by Loan
is no way to choke a Deficit . Neither is oil the substance for quenching
conflagrations ; -- but , only for assuaging them , not permanently ! To the
Nonpareil himself , who wanted not insight , it is clear at intervals ,
and dimly certain at all times , that his trade is by nature temporary ,
growing daily more difficult ; that changes incalculable lie at no great
distance . Apart from financial Deficit , the world is wholly in such a
new @-@ fangled humour ; all things working loose from their old fastenings ,
towards new issues and combinations . There is not a dwarf jokei , a cropt
Brutus &apos; -head , or Anglomaniac horseman rising on his stirrups , that
does not betoken change . But what then ? The day , in any case , passes
pleasantly ; for the morrow , if the morrow come , there shall be counsel
too . Once mounted ( by munificence , suasion , magic of genius ) high enough
in favour with the Oeil @-@ de @-@ Boeuf , with the King , Queen , Stock @-@ Exchange ,
and so far as possible with all men , a Nonpareil Controller may hope
to go careering through the Inevitable , in some unimagined way , as
handsomely as another .

At all events , for these three miraculous years , it has been expedient
heaped on expedient ; till now , with such cumulation and height , the pile
topples perilous . And here has this world &apos;s @-@ wonder of a Diamond Necklace
brought it at last to the clear verge of tumbling . Genius in that
direction can no more : mounted high enough , or not mounted , we must fare
forth . Hardly is poor Rohan , the Necklace @-@ Cardinal , safely bestowed in
the Auvergne Mountains , Dame de Lamotte ( unsafely ) in the Salpetriere ,
and that mournful business hushed up , when our sanguine Controller once
more astonishes the world . An expedient , unheard of for these hundred
and sixty years , has been propounded ; and , by dint of suasion ( for
his light audacity , his hope and eloquence are matchless ) has been got
adopted , -- Convocation of the Notables .

Let notable persons , the actual or virtual rulers of their districts ,
be summoned from all sides of France : let a true tale , of his Majesty &apos;s
patriotic purposes and wretched pecuniary impossibilities , be suasively
told them ; and then the question put : What are we to do ? Surely to adopt
healing measures ; such as the magic of genius will unfold ; such as , once
sanctioned by Notables , all Parlements and all men must , with more or
less reluctance , submit to .



Chapter 1.3.III.

The Notables .

Here , then is verily a sign and wonder ; visible to the whole world ;
bodeful of much . The Oeil @-@ de @-@ Boeuf dolorously grumbles ; were we not
well as we stood , -- quenching conflagrations by oil ? Constitutional
Philosophedom starts with joyful surprise ; stares eagerly what the
result will be . The public creditor , the public debtor , the whole
thinking and thoughtless public have their several surprises , joyful
and sorrowful . Count Mirabeau , who has got his matrimonial and other
Lawsuits huddled up , better or worse ; and works now in the dimmest
element at Berlin ; compiling Prussian Monarchies , Pamphlets On
Cagliostro ; writing , with pay , but not with honourable recognition ,
innumerable Despatches for his Government , -- scents or descries richer
quarry from afar . He , like an eagle or vulture , or mixture of both ,
preens his wings for flight homewards . ( Fils Adoptif , Memoires de
Mirabeau , t. iv. livv . 4 et 5 . )

M. de Calonne has stretched out an Aaron &apos;s Rod over France ; miraculous ;
and is summoning quite unexpected things . Audacity and hope alternate in
him with misgivings ; though the sanguine @-@ valiant side carries it . Anon
he writes to an intimate friend , &quot; Here me fais pitie a moi @-@ meme ( I am
an object of pity to myself ) ; &quot; anon , invites some dedicating Poet or
Poetaster to sing &apos; this Assembly of the Notables and the Revolution
that is preparing . &apos; ( Biographie Universelle , para Calonne ( by Guizot ) . )
Preparing indeed ; and a matter to be sung , -- only not till we have seen
it , and what the issue of it is . In deep obscure unrest , all things
have so long gone rocking and swaying : will M. de Calonne , with this
his alchemy of the Notables , fasten all together again , and get new
revenues ? Or wrench all asunder ; so that it go no longer rocking and
swaying , but clashing and colliding ?

Be this as it may , in the bleak short days , we behold men of weight and
influence threading the great vortex of French Locomotion , each on
his several line , from all sides of France towards the Chateau of
Versailles : summoned thither de par le roi . There , on the 22d day of
February 1787 , they have met , and got installed : Notables to the
number of a Hundred and Thirty @-@ seven , as we count them name by name :
( Lacretelle , iii . 286 . Montgaillard , i . 347 . ) add Seven Princes of the
Blood , it makes the round Gross of Notables . Men of the sword , men of
the robe ; Peers , dignified Clergy , Parlementary Presidents : divided into
Seven Boards ( Bureaux ) ; under our Seven Princes of the Blood , Monsieur ,
D &apos;Artois , Penthievre , and the rest ; among whom let not our new Duke
d &apos;Orleans ( for , since 1785 , he is Chartres no longer ) be forgotten .
Never yet made Admiral , and now turning the corner of his fortieth year ,
with spoiled blood and prospects ; half @-@ weary of a world which is more
than half @-@ weary of him , Monseigneur &apos;s future is most questionable . Not
in illumination and insight , not even in conflagration ; but , as was
said , &apos; in dull smoke and ashes of outburnt sensualities , &apos; does he
live and digest . Sumptuosity and sordidness ; revenge , life @-@ weariness ,
ambition , darkness , putrescence ; and , say , in sterling money , three
hundred thousand a year , -- were this poor Prince once to burst loose from
his Court @-@ moorings , to what regions , with what phenomena , might he not
sail and drift ! Happily as yet he &apos; affects to hunt daily ; &apos; sits there ,
since he must sit , presiding that Bureau of his , with dull moon @-@ visage ,
dull glassy eyes , as if it were a mere tedium to him .

We observe finally , that Count Mirabeau has actually arrived . He
descends from Berlin , on the scene of action ; glares into it with
flashing sun @-@ glance ; discerns that it will do nothing for him . He had
hoped these Notables might need a Secretary . They do need one ; but
have fixed on Dupont de Nemours ; a man of smaller fame , but then of
better ; -- who indeed , as his friends often hear , labours under this
complaint , surely not a universal one , of having &apos; five kings to
correspond with . &apos; ( Dumont , Souvenirs sur Mirabeau ( Paris , 1832 ) , p . 20 . )
The pen of a Mirabeau cannot become an official one ; nevertheless
it remains a pen . In defect of Secretaryship , he sets to denouncing
Stock @-@ brokerage ( Denonciation de l &apos;Agiotage ) ; testifying , as his wont
is , by loud bruit , that he is present and busy ; -- till , warned by friend
Talleyrand , and even by Calonne himself underhand , that &apos; a seventeenth
Lettre @-@ de @-@ Cachet may be launched against him , &apos; he timefully flits over
the marches .

And now , in stately royal apartments , as Pictures of that time still
represent them , our hundred and forty @-@ four Notables sit organised ; ready
to hear and consider . Controller Calonne is dreadfully behindhand with
his speeches , his preparatives ; however , the man &apos;s &apos; facility of work &apos; is
known to us . For freshness of style , lucidity , ingenuity , largeness
of view , that opening Harangue of his was unsurpassable : -- had not the
subject @-@ matter been so appalling . A Deficit , concerning which accounts
vary , and the Controller &apos;s own account is not unquestioned ; but which
all accounts agree in representing as &apos; enormous . &apos; This is the epitome of
our Controller &apos;s difficulties : and then his means ? Mere Turgotism ; for
thither , it seems , we must come at last : Provincial Assemblies ; new
Taxation ; nay , strangest of all , new Land @-@ tax , what he calls Subvention
Territoriale , from which neither Privileged nor Unprivileged , Noblemen ,
Clergy , nor Parlementeers , shall be exempt !

Foolish enough ! These Privileged Classes have been used to tax ; levying
toll , tribute and custom , at all hands , while a penny was left : but to
be themselves taxed ? Of such Privileged persons , meanwhile , do these
Notables , all but the merest fraction , consist . Headlong Calonne had
given no heed to the &apos; composition , &apos; or judicious packing of them ; but
chosen such Notables as were really notable ; trusting for the issue to
off @-@ hand ingenuity , good fortune , and eloquence that never yet failed .
Headlong Controller @-@ General ! Eloquence can do much , but not all .
Orpheus , with eloquence grown rhythmic , musical ( what we call Poetry ) ,
drew iron tears from the cheek of Pluto : but by what witchery of rhyme
or prose wilt thou from the pocket of Plutus draw gold ?

Accordingly , the storm that now rose and began to whistle round Calonne ,
first in these Seven Bureaus , and then on the outside of them , awakened
by them , spreading wider and wider over all France , threatens to become
unappeasable . A Deficit so enormous ! Mismanagement , profusion is too
clear . Peculation itself is hinted at ; nay , Lafayette and others go so
far as to speak it out , with attempts at proof . The blame of his Deficit
our brave Calonne , as was natural , had endeavoured to shift from
himself on his predecessors ; not excepting even Necker . But now Necker
vehemently denies ; whereupon an &apos; angry Correspondence , &apos; which also finds
its way into print .

In the Oeil @-@ de @-@ Boeuf , and her Majesty &apos;s private Apartments , an eloquent
Controller , with his &quot; Madame , if it is but difficult , &quot; had been
persuasive : but , alas , the cause is now carried elsewhither . Behold
him , one of these sad days , in Monsieur &apos;s Bureau ; to which all the other
Bureaus have sent deputies . He is standing at bay : alone ; exposed to an
incessant fire of questions , interpellations , objurgations , from those
&apos;hundred and thirty @-@ seven &apos; pieces of logic @-@ ordnance , -- what we may well
call bouches a feu , fire @-@ mouths literally ! Never , according to Besenval ,
or hardly ever , had such display of intellect , dexterity , coolness ,
suasive eloquence , been made by man . To the raging play of so many
fire @-@ mouths he opposes nothing angrier than light @-@ beams , self @-@ possession
and fatherly smiles . With the imperturbablest bland clearness , he , for
five hours long , keeps answering the incessant volley of fiery captious
questions , reproachful interpellations ; in words prompt as lightning ,
quiet as light . Nay , the cross @-@ fire too : such side questions and
incidental interpellations as , in the heat of the main @-@ battle , he
( having only one tongue ) could not get answered ; these also he takes
up at the first slake ; answers even these . ( Besenval , iii . 196 . ) Could
blandest suasive eloquence have saved France , she were saved .

Heavy @-@ laden Controller ! In the Seven Bureaus seems nothing but
hindrance : in Monsieur &apos;s Bureau , a Lomenie de Brienne , Archbishop
of Toulouse , with an eye himself to the Controllership , stirs up the
Clergy ; there are meetings , underground intrigues . Neither from without
anywhere comes sign of help or hope . For the Nation ( where Mirabeau is
now , with stentor @-@ lungs , &apos; denouncing Agio &apos; ) the Controller has hitherto
done nothing , or less . For Philosophedom he has done as good as
nothing , -- sent out some scientific Laperouse , or the like : and is he not
in &apos; angry correspondence &apos; with its Necker ? The very Oeil @-@ de @-@ Boeuf
looks questionable ; a falling Controller has no friends . Solid M. de
Vergennes , who with his phlegmatic judicious punctuality might have kept
down many things , died the very week before these sorrowful Notables
met . And now a Seal @-@ keeper , Garde @-@ des @-@ Sceaux Miromenil is thought to be
playing the traitor : spinning plots for Lomenie @-@ Brienne ! Queen &apos;s @-@ Reader
Abbe de Vermond , unloved individual , was Brienne &apos;s creature , the work
of his hands from the first : it may be feared the backstairs passage is
open , ground getting mined under our feet . Treacherous Garde @-@ des @-@ Sceaux
Miromenil , at least , should be dismissed ; Lamoignon , the
eloquent Notable , a stanch man , with connections , and even ideas ,
Parlement @-@ President yet intent on reforming Parlements , were not he the
right Keeper ? So , for one , thinks busy Besenval ; and , at dinner @-@ table ,
rounds the same into the Controller &apos;s ear , -- who always , in the intervals
of landlord @-@ duties , listens to him as with charmed look , but answers
nothing positive . ( Besenval , iii . 203 . )

Alas , what to answer ? The force of private intrigue , and then also the
force of public opinion , grows so dangerous , confused ! Philosophedom
sneers aloud , as if its Necker already triumphed . The gaping populace
gapes over Wood @-@ cuts or Copper @-@ cuts ; where , for example , a Rustic is
represented convoking the poultry of his barnyard , with this opening
address : &quot; Dear animals , I have assembled you to advise me what sauce I
shall dress you with ; &quot; to which a Cock responding , &quot; We don &apos;t want to be
eaten , &quot; is checked by &quot; You wander from the point ( Vous vous ecartez
de la question ) . &quot; ( Republished in the Musee de la Caricature ( Paris ,
1834 ) . ) Laughter and logic ; ballad @-@ singer , pamphleteer ; epigram and
caricature : what wind of public opinion is this , -- as if the Cave of the
Winds were bursting loose ! At nightfall , President Lamoignon steals
over to the Controller &apos;s ; finds him &apos; walking with large strides in his
chamber , like one out of himself . &apos; ( Besenval , iii . 209 . ) With rapid
confused speech the Controller begs M. de Lamoignon to give him &apos; an
advice . &apos; Lamoignon candidly answers that , except in regard to his own
anticipated Keepership , unless that would prove remedial , he really
cannot take upon him to advise .

&apos;On the Monday after Easter , &apos; the 9th of April 1787 , a date one rejoices
to verify , for nothing can excel the indolent falsehood of these
Histoires and Memoires , -- &apos; On the Monday after Easter , as I , Besenval ,
was riding towards Romainville to the Marechal de Segur &apos;s , I met a
friend on the Boulevards , who told me that M. de Calonne was out . A
little further on came M. the Duke d &apos;Orleans , dashing towards me , head
to the wind &apos; ( trotting a l &apos;Anglaise ) , &apos; and confirmed the news . &apos; ( Ib .
iii . 211 . ) It is true news . Treacherous Garde @-@ des @-@ Sceaux Miromenil is
gone , and Lamoignon is appointed in his room : but appointed for his own
profit only , not for the Controller &apos;s : &apos; next day &apos; the Controller also
has had to move . A little longer he may linger near ; be seen among the
money changers , and even &apos; working in the Controller &apos;s office , &apos; where
much lies unfinished : but neither will that hold . Too strong blows and
beats this tempest of public opinion , of private intrigue , as from the
Cave of all the Winds ; and blows him ( higher Authority giving sign )
out of Paris and France , -- over the horizon , into Invisibility , or uuter
( utter , outer ? ) Darkness .

Such destiny the magic of genius could not forever avert . Ungrateful
Oeil @-@ de @-@ Boeuf ! did he not miraculously rain gold manna on you ; so that ,
as a Courtier said , &quot; All the world held out its hand , and I held out my
hat , &quot; -- for a time ? Himself is poor ; penniless , had not a &apos; Financier &apos;s
widow in Lorraine &apos; offered him , though he was turned of fifty , her hand
and the rich purse it held . Dim henceforth shall be his activity , though
unwearied : Letters to the King , Appeals , Prognostications ; Pamphlets
( from London ) , written with the old suasive facility ; which however do
not persuade . Luckily his widow &apos;s purse fails not . Once , in a year or
two , some shadow of him shall be seen hovering on the Northern Border ,
seeking election as National Deputy ; but be sternly beckoned away .
Dimmer then , far @-@ borne over utmost European lands , in uncertain twilight
of diplomacy , he shall hover , intriguing for &apos; Exiled Princes , &apos; and
have adventures ; be overset into the Rhine stream and half @-@ drowned ,
nevertheless save his papers dry . Unwearied , but in vain ! In France he
works miracles no more ; shall hardly return thither to find a grave .
Farewell , thou facile sanguine Controller @-@ General , with thy light rash
hand , thy suasive mouth of gold : worse men there have been , and better ;
but to thee also was allotted a task , -- of raising the wind , and the
winds ; and thou hast done it .

But now , while Ex @-@ Controller Calonne flies storm @-@ driven over the
horizon , in this singular way , what has become of the Controllership ?
It hangs vacant , one may say ; extinct , like the Moon in her vacant
interlunar cave . Two preliminary shadows , poor M. Fourqueux , poor
M. Villedeuil , do hold in quick succession some simulacrum of it ,
( Besenval , iii . 225 . ) -- as the new Moon will sometimes shine out with a
dim preliminary old one in her arms . Be patient , ye Notables ! An actual
new Controller is certain , and even ready ; were the indispensable
manoeuvres but gone through . Long @-@ headed Lamoignon , with Home Secretary
Breteuil , and Foreign Secretary Montmorin have exchanged looks ; let
these three once meet and speak . Who is it that is strong in the Queen &apos;s
favour , and the Abbe de Vermond &apos;s ? That is a man of great capacity ?
Or at least that has struggled , these fifty years , to have it thought
great ; now , in the Clergy &apos;s name , demanding to have Protestant
death @-@ penalties &apos; put in execution ; &apos; no flaunting it in the
Oeil @-@ de @-@ Boeuf , as the gayest man @-@ pleaser and woman @-@ pleaser ; gleaning
even a good word from Philosophedom and your Voltaires and D &apos;Alemberts ?
With a party ready @-@ made for him in the Notables ? -- Lomenie de Brienne ,
Archbishop of Toulouse ! answer all the three , with the clearest
instantaneous concord ; and rush off to propose him to the King ; &apos; in such
haste , &apos; says Besenval , &apos; that M. de Lamoignon had to borrow a simarre , &apos;
seemingly some kind of cloth apparatus necessary for that . ( Ib. iii .
224 . )

Lomenie @-@ Brienne , who had all his life &apos; felt a kind of predestination for
the highest offices , &apos; has now therefore obtained them . He presides over
the Finances ; he shall have the title of Prime Minister itself , and
the effort of his long life be realised . Unhappy only that it took such
talent and industry to gain the place ; that to qualify for it hardly any
talent or industry was left disposable ! Looking now into his inner
man , what qualification he may have , Lomenie beholds , not without
astonishment , next to nothing but vacuity and possibility . Principles or
methods , acquirement outward or inward ( for his very body is wasted , by
hard tear and wear ) he finds none ; not so much as a plan , even an
unwise one . Lucky , in these circumstances , that Calonne has had a plan !
Calonne &apos;s plan was gathered from Turgot &apos;s and Necker &apos;s by compilation ;
shall become Lomenie &apos;s by adoption . Not in vain has Lomenie studied
the working of the British Constitution ; for he professes to have some
Anglomania , of a sort . Why , in that free country , does one Minister ,
driven out by Parliament , vanish from his King &apos;s presence , and another
enter , borne in by Parliament ? ( Montgaillard , Histoire de France , i .
410 @-@ 17 . ) Surely not for mere change ( which is ever wasteful ) ; but that
all men may have share of what is going ; and so the strife of Freedom
indefinitely prolong itself , and no harm be done .

The Notables , mollified by Easter festivities , by the sacrifice of
Calonne , are not in the worst humour . Already his Majesty , while the
&apos;interlunar shadows &apos; were in office , had held session of Notables ; and
from his throne delivered promissory conciliatory eloquence : &apos; The Queen
stood waiting at a window , till his carriage came back ; and Monsieur
from afar clapped hands to her , &apos; in sign that all was well . ( Besenval ,
iii . 220 . ) It has had the best effect ; if such do but last . Leading
Notables meanwhile can be &apos; caressed ; &apos; Brienne &apos;s new gloss , Lamoignon &apos;s
long head will profit somewhat ; conciliatory eloquence shall not be
wanting . On the whole , however , is it not undeniable that this of
ousting Calonne and adopting the plans of Calonne , is a measure which ,
to produce its best effect , should be looked at from a certain distance ,
cursorily ; not dwelt on with minute near scrutiny . In a word , that no
service the Notables could now do were so obliging as , in some handsome
manner , to -- take themselves away ! Their &apos; Six Propositions &apos; about
Provisional Assemblies , suppression of Corvees and suchlike , can be
accepted without criticism . The Subvention on Land @-@ tax , and much
else , one must glide hastily over ; safe nowhere but in flourishes of
conciliatory eloquence . Till at length , on this 25th of May , year
1787 , in solemn final session , there bursts forth what we can call an
explosion of eloquence ; King , Lomenie , Lamoignon and retinue taking up
the successive strain ; in harrangues to the number of ten , besides his
Majesty &apos;s , which last the livelong day ; -- whereby , as in a kind of choral
anthem , or bravura peal , of thanks , praises , promises , the Notables are ,
so to speak , organed out , and dismissed to their respective places of
abode . They had sat , and talked , some nine weeks : they were the first
Notables since Richelieu &apos;s , in the year 1626 .

By some Historians , sitting much at their ease , in the safe distance ,
Lomenie has been blamed for this dismissal of his Notables : nevertheless
it was clearly time . There are things , as we said , which should not be
dwelt on with minute close scrutiny : over hot coals you cannot glide too
fast . In these Seven Bureaus , where no work could be done , unless talk
were work , the questionablest matters were coming up . Lafayette , for
example , in Monseigneur d &apos;Artois &apos; Bureau , took upon him to set forth
more than one deprecatory oration about Lettres @-@ de @-@ Cachet , Liberty
of the Subject , Agio , and suchlike ; which Monseigneur endeavouring to
repress , was answered that a Notable being summoned to speak his opinion
must speak it . ( Montgaillard , i . 360 . )

Thus too his Grace the Archbishop of Aix perorating once , with a
plaintive pulpit tone , in these words ? &quot; Tithe , that free @-@ will offering
of the piety of Christians &quot; -- &quot; Tithe , &quot; interrupted Duke la Rochefoucault ,
with the cold business @-@ manner he has learned from the English , &quot; that
free @-@ will offering of the piety of Christians ; on which there are now
forty @-@ thousand lawsuits in this realm . &quot; ( Dumont , Souvenirs sur Mirabeau ,
p . 21 . ) Nay , Lafayette , bound to speak his opinion , went the length ,
one day , of proposing to convoke a &apos; National Assembly . &apos; &quot; You
demand States @-@ General ? &quot; asked Monseigneur with an air of minatory
surprise . -- &quot; Yes , Monseigneur ; and even better than that . &quot; -- &quot; Write it , &quot;
said Monseigneur to the Clerks . ( Toulongeon , Histoire de France depuis
la Revolution de 1789 ( Paris , 1803 ) , i. app . 4 . ) -- Written accordingly it
is ; and what is more , will be acted by and by .



Chapter 1.3.IV.

Lomenie &apos;s Edicts .

Thus , then , have the Notables returned home ; carrying to all quarters
of France , such notions of deficit , decrepitude , distraction ; and that
States @-@ General will cure it , or will not cure it but kill it . Each
Notable , we may fancy , is as a funeral torch ; disclosing hideous
abysses , better left hid ! The unquietest humour possesses all men ;
ferments , seeks issue , in pamphleteering , caricaturing , projecting ,
declaiming ; vain jangling of thought , word and deed .

It is Spiritual Bankruptcy , long tolerated ; verging now towards
Economical Bankruptcy , and become intolerable . For from the lowest dumb
rank , the inevitable misery , as was predicted , has spread upwards . In
every man is some obscure feeling that his position , oppressive or else
oppressed , is a false one : all men , in one or the other acrid dialect ,
as assaulters or as defenders , must give vent to the unrest that is in
them . Of such stuff national well @-@ being , and the glory of rulers , is not
made . O Lomenie , what a wild @-@ heaving , waste @-@ looking , hungry and angry
world hast thou , after lifelong effort , got promoted to take charge of !

Lomenie &apos;s first Edicts are mere soothing ones : creation of Provincial
Assemblies , &apos; for apportioning the imposts , &apos; when we get any ; suppression
of Corvees or statute @-@ labour ; alleviation of Gabelle . Soothing measures ,
recommended by the Notables ; long clamoured for by all liberal men .
Oil cast on the waters has been known to produce a good effect . Before
venturing with great essential measures , Lomenie will see this singular
&apos;swell of the public mind &apos; abate somewhat .

Most proper , surely . But what if it were not a swell of the abating
kind ? There are swells that come of upper tempest and wind @-@ gust . But
again there are swells that come of subterranean pent wind , some
say ; and even of inward decomposition , of decay that has become
self @-@ combustion : -- as when , according to Neptuno @-@ Plutonic Geology , the
World is all decayed down into due attritus of this sort ; and shall now
be exploded , and new @-@ made ! These latter abate not by oil . -- The fool
says in his heart , How shall not tomorrow be as yesterday ; as all
days , -- which were once tomorrows ? The wise man , looking on this France ,
moral , intellectual , economical , sees , &apos; in short , all the symptoms he
has ever met with in history , &apos; -- unabatable by soothing Edicts .

Meanwhile , abate or not , cash must be had ; and for that quite another
sort of Edicts , namely &apos; bursal &apos; or fiscal ones . How easy were fiscal
Edicts , did you know for certain that the Parlement of Paris would what
they call &apos; register &apos; them ! Such right of registering , properly of mere
writing down , the Parlement has got by old wont ; and , though but a
Law @-@ Court , can remonstrate , and higgle considerably about the same .
Hence many quarrels ; desperate Maupeou devices , and victory and
defeat ; -- a quarrel now near forty years long . Hence fiscal Edicts , which
otherwise were easy enough , become such problems . For example , is there
not Calonne &apos;s Subvention Territoriale , universal , unexempting Land @-@ tax ;
the sheet @-@ anchor of Finance ? Or , to show , so far as possible , that one
is not without original finance talent , Lomenie himself can devise an
Edit du Timbre or Stamp @-@ tax , -- borrowed also , it is true ; but then from
America : may it prove luckier in France than there !

France has her resources : nevertheless , it cannot be denied , the aspect
of that Parlement is questionable . Already among the Notables , in that
final symphony of dismissal , the Paris President had an ominous tone .
Adrien Duport , quitting magnetic sleep , in this agitation of the world ,
threatens to rouse himself into preternatural wakefulness . Shallower but
also louder , there is magnetic D &apos;Espremenil , with his tropical heat
( he was born at Madras ) ; with his dusky confused violence ; holding
of Illumination , Animal Magnetism , Public Opinion , Adam Weisshaupt ,
Harmodius and Aristogiton , and all manner of confused violent things : of
whom can come no good . The very Peerage is infected with the leaven . Our
Peers have , in too many cases , laid aside their frogs , laces , bagwigs ;
and go about in English costume , or ride rising in their stirrups , -- in
the most headlong manner ; nothing but insubordination , eleutheromania ,
confused unlimited opposition in their heads . Questionable : not to be
ventured upon , if we had a Fortunatus &apos; Purse ! But Lomenie has waited all
June , casting on the waters what oil he had ; and now , betide as it may ,
the two Finance Edicts must out . On the 6th of July , he forwards his
proposed Stamp @-@ tax and Land @-@ tax to the Parlement of Paris ; and , as if
putting his own leg foremost , not his borrowed Calonne &apos;s @-@ leg , places the
Stamp @-@ tax first in order .

Alas , the Parlement will not register : the Parlement demands instead a
&apos;state of the expenditure , &apos; a &apos; state of the contemplated reductions ; &apos;
&apos;states &apos; enough ; which his Majesty must decline to furnish ! Discussions
arise ; patriotic eloquence : the Peers are summoned . Does the Nemean Lion
begin to bristle ? Here surely is a duel , which France and the Universe
may look upon : with prayers ; at lowest , with curiosity and bets . Paris
stirs with new animation . The outer courts of the Palais de Justice roll
with unusual crowds , coming and going ; their huge outer hum mingles with
the clang of patriotic eloquence within , and gives vigour to it . Poor
Lomenie gazes from the distance , little comforted ; has his invisible
emissaries flying to and fro , assiduous , without result .

So pass the sultry dog @-@ days , in the most electric manner ; and the whole
month of July . And still , in the Sanctuary of Justice , sounds nothing
but Harmodius @-@ Aristogiton eloquence , environed with the hum of crowding
Paris ; and no registering accomplished , and no &apos; states &apos; furnished .
&quot; States ? &quot; said a lively Parlementeer : &quot; Messieurs , the states that should
be furnished us , in my opinion are the STATES @-@ GENERAL . &quot; On which timely
joke there follow cachinnatory buzzes of approval . What a word to be
spoken in the Palais de Justice ! Old D &apos;Ormesson ( the Ex @-@ Controller &apos;s
uncle ) shakes his judicious head ; far enough from laughing . But the
outer courts , and Paris and France , catch the glad sound , and repeat
it ; shall repeat it , and re @-@ echo and reverberate it , till it grow a
deafening peal . Clearly enough here is no registering to be thought of .

The pious Proverb says , &apos; There are remedies for all things but death . &apos; 
When a Parlement refuses registering , the remedy , by long practice , has
become familiar to the simplest : a Bed of Justice . One complete month
this Parlement has spent in mere idle jargoning , and sound and fury ; the
Timbre Edict not registered , or like to be ; the Subvention not yet so
much as spoken of . On the 6th of August let the whole refractory
Body roll out , in wheeled vehicles , as far as the King &apos;s Chateau of
Versailles ; there shall the King , holding his Bed of Justice , order
them , by his own royal lips , to register . They may remonstrate , in an
under tone ; but they must obey , lest a worse unknown thing befall them .

It is done : the Parlement has rolled out , on royal summons ; has heard
the express royal order to register . Whereupon it has rolled back again ,
amid the hushed expectancy of men . And now , behold , on the morrow , this
Parlement , seated once more in its own Palais , with &apos; crowds inundating
the outer courts , &apos; not only does not register , but ( O portent ! ) declares
all that was done on the prior day to be null , and the Bed of Justice
as good as a futility ! In the history of France here verily is a new
feature . Nay better still , our heroic Parlement , getting suddenly
enlightened on several things , declares that , for its part , it is
incompetent to register Tax @-@ edicts at all , -- having done it by mistake ,
during these late centuries ; that for such act one authority only is
competent : the assembled Three Estates of the Realm !

To such length can the universal spirit of a Nation penetrate the most
isolated Body @-@ corporate : say rather , with such weapons , homicidal and
suicidal , in exasperated political duel , will Bodies @-@ corporate fight !
But , in any case , is not this the real death @-@ grapple of war and
internecine duel , Greek meeting Greek ; whereon men , had they even no
interest in it , might look with interest unspeakable ? Crowds , as was
said , inundate the outer courts : inundation of young eleutheromaniac
Noblemen in English costume , uttering audacious speeches ; of Procureurs ,
Basoche @-@ Clerks , who are idle in these days : of Loungers , Newsmongers and
other nondescript classes , -- rolls tumultuous there . &apos; From three to four
thousand persons , &apos; waiting eagerly to hear the Arretes ( Resolutions ) you
arrive at within ; applauding with bravos , with the clapping of from six
to eight thousand hands ! Sweet also is the meed of patriotic eloquence ,
when your D &apos;Espremenil , your Freteau , or Sabatier , issuing from his
Demosthenic Olympus , the thunder being hushed for the day , is welcomed ,
in the outer courts , with a shout from four thousand throats ; is borne
home shoulder @-@ high &apos; with benedictions , &apos; and strikes the stars with his
sublime head .



Chapter 1.3.V.

Lomenie &apos;s Thunderbolts .

Arise , Lomenie @-@ Brienne : here is no case for &apos; Letters of Jussion ; &apos; for
faltering or compromise . Thou seest the whole loose fluent population
of Paris ( whatsoever is not solid , and fixed to work ) inundating these
outer courts , like a loud destructive deluge ; the very Basoche of
Lawyers &apos; Clerks talks sedition . The lower classes , in this duel of
Authority with Authority , Greek throttling Greek , have ceased to respect
the City @-@ Watch : Police @-@ satellites are marked on the back with chalk ( the
M signifies mouchard , spy ) ; they are hustled , hunted like ferae naturae .
Subordinate rural Tribunals send messengers of congratulation , of
adherence . Their Fountain of Justice is becoming a Fountain of Revolt .
The Provincial Parlements look on , with intent eye , with breathless
wishes , while their elder sister of Paris does battle : the whole Twelve
are of one blood and temper ; the victory of one is that of all .

Ever worse it grows : on the 10th of August , there is &apos; Plainte &apos; emitted
touching the &apos; prodigalities of Calonne , &apos; and permission to &apos; proceed&apos;
against him . No registering , but instead of it , denouncing :
of dilapidation , peculation ; and ever the burden of the song ,
States @-@ General ! Have the royal armories no thunderbolt , that thou
couldst , O Lomenie , with red right @-@ hand , launch it among these
Demosthenic theatrical thunder @-@ barrels , mere resin and noise for most
part ; -- and shatter , and smite them silent ? On the night of the 14th of
August , Lomenie launches his thunderbolt , or handful of them . Letters
named of the Seal ( de Cachet ) , as many as needful , some sixscore and
odd , are delivered overnight . And so , next day betimes , the whole
Parlement , once more set on wheels , is rolling incessantly towards
Troyes in Champagne ; &apos; escorted , &apos; says History , &apos; with the blessings of
all people ; &apos; the very innkeepers and postillions looking gratuitously
reverent . ( A. Lameth , Histoire de l &apos;Assemblee Constituante ( Int . 73 ) . )
This is the 15th of August 1787 .

What will not people bless ; in their extreme need ? Seldom had the
Parlement of Paris deserved much blessing , or received much . An isolated
Body @-@ corporate , which , out of old confusions ( while the Sceptre of the
Sword was confusedly struggling to become a Sceptre of the Pen ) , had got
itself together , better and worse , as Bodies @-@ corporate do , to satisfy
some dim desire of the world , and many clear desires of individuals ; and
so had grown , in the course of centuries , on concession , on acquirement
and usurpation , to be what we see it : a prosperous social Anomaly ,
deciding Lawsuits , sanctioning or rejecting Laws ; and withal disposing
of its places and offices by sale for ready money , -- which method
sleek President Henault , after meditation , will demonstrate to be the
indifferent @-@ best . ( Abrege Chronologique , p . 975 . )

In such a Body , existing by purchase for ready @-@ money , there could not
be excess of public spirit ; there might well be excess of eagerness to
divide the public spoil . Men in helmets have divided that , with swords ;
men in wigs , with quill and inkhorn , do divide it : and even more
hatefully these latter , if more peaceably ; for the wig @-@ method is at once
irresistibler and baser . By long experience , says Besenval , it has been
found useless to sue a Parlementeer at law ; no Officer of Justice will
serve a writ on one ; his wig and gown are his Vulcan &apos;s @-@ panoply , his
enchanted cloak @-@ of @-@ darkness .

The Parlement of Paris may count itself an unloved body ; mean , not
magnanimous , on the political side . Were the King weak , always ( as now )
has his Parlement barked , cur @-@ like at his heels ; with what popular cry
there might be . Were he strong , it barked before his face ; hunting for
him as his alert beagle . An unjust Body ; where foul influences have more
than once worked shameful perversion of judgment . Does not , in these
very days , the blood of murdered Lally cry aloud for vengeance ? Baited ,
circumvented , driven mad like the snared lion , Valour had to sink
extinguished under vindictive Chicane . Behold him , that hapless Lally ,
his wild dark soul looking through his wild dark face ; trailed on the
ignominious death @-@ hurdle ; the voice of his despair choked by a wooden
gag ! The wild fire @-@ soul that has known only peril and toil ; and , for
threescore years , has buffeted against Fate &apos;s obstruction and men &apos;s
perfidy , like genius and courage amid poltroonery , dishonesty and
commonplace ; faithfully enduring and endeavouring , -- O Parlement of
Paris , dost thou reward it with a gibbet and a gag ? ( 9th May , 1766 :
Biographie Universelle , para Lally . ) The dying Lally bequeathed his
memory to his boy ; a young Lally has arisen , demanding redress in the
name of God and man . The Parlement of Paris does its utmost to defend
the indefensible , abominable ; nay , what is singular , dusky @-@ glowing
Aristogiton d &apos;Espremenil is the man chosen to be its spokesman in that .

Such Social Anomaly is it that France now blesses . An unclean Social
Anomaly ; but in duel against another worse ! The exiled Parlement is felt
to have &apos; covered itself with glory . &apos; There are quarrels in which even
Satan , bringing help , were not unwelcome ; even Satan , fighting stiffly ,
might cover himself with glory , -- of a temporary sort .

But what a stir in the outer courts of the Palais , when Paris finds its
Parlement trundled off to Troyes in Champagne ; and nothing left but a
few mute Keepers of records ; the Demosthenic thunder become extinct , the
martyrs of liberty clean gone ! Confused wail and menace rises from the
four thousand throats of Procureurs , Basoche @-@ Clerks , Nondescripts , and
Anglomaniac Noblesse ; ever new idlers crowd to see and hear ; Rascality ,
with increasing numbers and vigour , hunts mouchards . Loud whirlpool
rolls through these spaces ; the rest of the City , fixed to its work ,
cannot yet go rolling . Audacious placards are legible , in and about
the Palais , the speeches are as good as seditious . Surely the temper
of Paris is much changed . On the third day of this business ( 18th of
August ) , Monsieur and Monseigneur d &apos;Artois , coming in state @-@ carriages ,
according to use and wont , to have these late obnoxious Arretes and
protests &apos; expunged &apos; from the Records , are received in the most marked
manner . Monsieur , who is thought to be in opposition , is met with vivats
and strewed flowers ; Monseigneur , on the other hand , with silence ; with
murmurs , which rise to hisses and groans ; nay , an irreverent Rascality
presses towards him in floods , with such hissing vehemence , that
the Captain of the Guards has to give order , &quot; Haut les armes ( Handle
arms ) ! &quot; -- at which thunder @-@ word , indeed , and the flash of the clear
iron , the Rascal @-@ flood recoils , through all avenues , fast enough .
( Montgaillard , i . 369 . Besenval , &amp; c . ) New features these . Indeed , as
good M. de Malesherbes pertinently remarks , &quot; it is a quite new kind
of contest this with the Parlement : &quot; no transitory sputter , as from
collision of hard bodies ; but more like &quot; the first sparks of what , if
not quenched , may become a great conflagration . &quot; ( Montgaillard , i . 373 . )

This good Malesherbes sees himself now again in the King &apos;s Council ,
after an absence of ten years : Lomenie would profit if not by the
faculties of the man , yet by the name he has . As for the man &apos;s opinion ,
it is not listened to ; -- wherefore he will soon withdraw , a second time ;
back to his books and his trees . In such King &apos;s Council what can a good
man profit ? Turgot tries it not a second time : Turgot has quitted France
and this Earth , some years ago ; and now cares for none of these things .
Singular enough : Turgot , this same Lomenie , and the Abbe Morellet were
once a trio of young friends ; fellow @-@ scholars in the Sorbonne . Forty new
years have carried them severally thus far .

Meanwhile the Parlement sits daily at Troyes , calling cases ; and daily
adjourns , no Procureur making his appearance to plead . Troyes is as
hospitable as could be looked for : nevertheless one has comparatively
a dull life . No crowds now to carry you , shoulder @-@ high , to the immortal
gods ; scarcely a Patriot or two will drive out so far , and bid you be of
firm courage . You are in furnished lodgings , far from home and domestic
comfort : little to do , but wander over the unlovely Champagne fields ;
seeing the grapes ripen ; taking counsel about the thousand @-@ times
consulted : a prey to tedium ; in danger even that Paris may forget you .
Messengers come and go : pacific Lomenie is not slack in negotiating ,
promising ; D &apos;Ormesson and the prudent elder Members see no good in
strife .

After a dull month , the Parlement , yielding and retaining , makes truce ,
as all Parlements must . The Stamp @-@ tax is withdrawn : the Subvention
Land @-@ tax is also withdrawn ; but , in its stead , there is granted , what
they call a &apos; Prorogation of the Second Twentieth , &apos; -- itself a kind of
Land @-@ tax , but not so oppressive to the Influential classes ; which lies
mainly on the Dumb class . Moreover , secret promises exist ( on the part
of the Elders ) , that finances may be raised by Loan . Of the ugly word
States @-@ General there shall be no mention .

And so , on the 20th of September , our exiled Parlement returns :
D &apos;Espremenil said , &apos; it went out covered with glory , but had come back
covered with mud ( de boue ) . &apos; Not so , Aristogiton ; or if so , thou surely
art the man to clean it .



Chapter 1.3.VI.

Lomenie &apos;s Plots .

Was ever unfortunate Chief Minister so bested as Lomenie @-@ Brienne ? The
reins of the State fairly in his hand these six months ; and not the
smallest motive @-@ power ( of Finance ) to stir from the spot with , this
way or that ! He flourishes his whip , but advances not . Instead
of ready @-@ money , there is nothing but rebellious debating and
recalcitrating .

Far is the public mind from having calmed ; it goes chafing and fuming
ever worse : and in the royal coffers , with such yearly Deficit
running on , there is hardly the colour of coin . Ominous prognostics !
Malesherbes , seeing an exhausted , exasperated France grow hotter and
hotter , talks of &apos; conflagration : &apos; Mirabeau , without talk , has , as we
perceive , descended on Paris again , close on the rear of the Parlement ,
( Fils Adoptif , Mirabeau , iv. l . 5 . ) -- not to quit his native soil any
more .

Over the Frontiers , behold Holland invaded by Prussia ; ( October , 1787 .
Montgaillard , i . 374 . Besenval , iii . 283 . ) the French party oppressed ,
England and the Stadtholder triumphing : to the sorrow of War @-@ Secretary
Montmorin and all men . But without money , sinews of war , as of work , and
of existence itself , what can a Chief Minister do ? Taxes profit little :
this of the Second Twentieth falls not due till next year ; and will
then , with its &apos; strict valuation , &apos; produce more controversy than
cash . Taxes on the Privileged Classes cannot be got registered ; are
intolerable to our supporters themselves : taxes on the Unprivileged
yield nothing , -- as from a thing drained dry more cannot be drawn . Hope
is nowhere , if not in the old refuge of Loans .

To Lomenie , aided by the long head of Lamoignon , deeply pondering this
sea of troubles , the thought suggested itself : Why not have a Successive
Loan ( Emprunt Successif ) , or Loan that went on lending , year after year ,
as much as needful ; say , till 1792 ? The trouble of registering such Loan
were the same : we had then breathing time ; money to work with , at
least to subsist on . Edict of a Successive Loan must be proposed . To
conciliate the Philosophes , let a liberal Edict walk in front of it , for
emancipation of Protestants ; let a liberal Promise guard the rear of it ,
that when our Loan ends , in that final 1792 , the States @-@ General shall be
convoked .

Such liberal Edict of Protestant Emancipation , the time having come for
it , shall cost a Lomenie as little as the &apos; Death @-@ penalties to be put in
execution &apos; did . As for the liberal Promise , of States @-@ General , it can be
fulfilled or not : the fulfilment is five good years off ; in five
years much intervenes . But the registering ? Ah , truly , there is the
difficulty ! -- However , we have that promise of the Elders , given secretly
at Troyes . Judicious gratuities , cajoleries , underground intrigues , with
old Foulon , named &apos; Ame damnee , Familiar @-@ demon , of the Parlement , &apos;
may perhaps do the rest . At worst and lowest , the Royal Authority has
resources , -- which ought it not to put forth ? If it cannot realise
money , the Royal Authority is as good as dead ; dead of that surest and
miserablest death , inanition . Risk and win ; without risk all is already
lost ! For the rest , as in enterprises of pith , a touch of stratagem
often proves furthersome , his Majesty announces a Royal Hunt , for the
19th of November next ; and all whom it concerns are joyfully getting
their gear ready .

Royal Hunt indeed ; but of two @-@ legged unfeathered game ! At eleven in the
morning of that Royal @-@ Hunt day , 19th of November 1787 , unexpected blare
of trumpetting , tumult of charioteering and cavalcading disturbs the
Seat of Justice : his Majesty is come , with Garde @-@ des @-@ Sceaux Lamoignon ,
and Peers and retinue , to hold Royal Session and have Edicts registered .
What a change , since Louis XIV. entered here , in boots ; and , whip in
hand , ordered his registering to be done , -- with an Olympian look which
none durst gainsay ; and did , without stratagem , in such unceremonious
fashion , hunt as well as register ! ( Dulaure , vi . 306 . ) For Louis XVI . ,
on this day , the Registering will be enough ; if indeed he and the day
suffice for it .

Meanwhile , with fit ceremonial words , the purpose of the royal breast
is signified : -- Two Edicts , for Protestant Emancipation , for Successive
Loan : of both which Edicts our trusty Garde @-@ des @-@ Sceaux Lamoignon will
explain the purport ; on both which a trusty Parlement is requested to
deliver its opinion , each member having free privilege of speech . And
so , Lamoignon too having perorated not amiss , and wound up with that
Promise of States @-@ General , -- the Sphere @-@ music of Parlementary eloquence
begins . Explosive , responsive , sphere answering sphere , it waxes louder
and louder . The Peers sit attentive ; of diverse sentiment : unfriendly to
States @-@ General ; unfriendly to Despotism , which cannot reward merit , and
is suppressing places . But what agitates his Highness d &apos;Orleans ? The
rubicund moon @-@ head goes wagging ; darker beams the copper visage , like
unscoured copper ; in the glazed eye is disquietude ; he rolls uneasy in
his seat , as if he meant something . Amid unutterable satiety , has sudden
new appetite , for new forbidden fruit , been vouchsafed him ? Disgust
and edacity ; laziness that cannot rest ; futile ambition , revenge ,
non @-@ admiralship : -- O , within that carbuncled skin what a confusion of
confusions sits bottled !

&apos;Eight Couriers , &apos; in course of the day , gallop from Versailles , where
Lomenie waits palpitating ; and gallop back again , not with the best
news . In the outer Courts of the Palais , huge buzz of expectation
reigns ; it is whispered the Chief Minister has lost six votes overnight .
And from within , resounds nothing but forensic eloquence , pathetic and
even indignant ; heartrending appeals to the royal clemency , that his
Majesty would please to summon States @-@ General forthwith , and be the
Saviour of France : -- wherein dusky @-@ glowing D &apos;Espremenil , but still more
Sabatier de Cabre , and Freteau , since named Commere Freteau ( Goody
Freteau ) , are among the loudest . For six mortal hours it lasts , in this
manner ; the infinite hubbub unslackened .

And so now , when brown dusk is falling through the windows , and no end
visible , his Majesty , on hint of Garde @-@ des @-@ Sceaux , Lamoignon , opens his
royal lips once more to say , in brief That he must have his Loan @-@ Edict
registered . -- Momentary deep pause ! -- See ! Monseigneur d &apos;Orleans rises ;
with moon @-@ visage turned towards the royal platform , he asks , with a
delicate graciosity of manner covering unutterable things : &quot; Whether it
is a Bed of Justice , then ; or a Royal Session ? &quot; Fire flashes on him from
the throne and neighbourhood : surly answer that &quot; it is a Session . &quot; In
that case , Monseigneur will crave leave to remark that Edicts cannot
be registered by order in a Session ; and indeed to enter , against such
registry , his individual humble Protest . &quot; Vous etes bien le maitre ( You
will do your pleasure ) &quot; , answers the King ; and thereupon , in high state ,
marches out , escorted by his Court @-@ retinue ; D &apos;Orleans himself , as
in duty bound , escorting him , but only to the gate . Which duty done ,
D &apos;Orleans returns in from the gate ; redacts his Protest , in the face
of an applauding Parlement , an applauding France ; and so -- has cut his
Court @-@ moorings , shall we say ? And will now sail and drift , fast enough ,
towards Chaos ?

Thou foolish D &apos;Orleans ; Equality that art to be ! Is Royalty grown a mere
wooden Scarecrow ; whereon thou , pert scald @-@ headed crow , mayest alight at
pleasure , and peck ? Not yet wholly .

Next day , a Lettre @-@ de @-@ Cachet sends D &apos;Orleans to bethink himself in his
Chateau of Villers @-@ Cotterets , where , alas , is no Paris with its
joyous necessaries of life ; no fascinating indispensable Madame
de Buffon , -- light wife of a great Naturalist much too old for her .
Monseigneur , it is said , does nothing but walk distractedly , at
Villers @-@ Cotterets ; cursing his stars . Versailles itself shall hear
penitent wail from him , so hard is his doom . By a second , simultaneous
Lettre @-@ de @-@ Cachet , Goody Freteau is hurled into the Stronghold of Ham ,
amid the Norman marshes ; by a third , Sabatier de Cabre into Mont St.
Michel , amid the Norman quicksands . As for the Parlement , it must , on
summons , travel out to Versailles , with its Register @-@ Book under its arm ,
to have the Protest biffe ( expunged ) ; not without admonition , and even
rebuke . A stroke of authority which , one might have hoped , would quiet
matters .

Unhappily , no ; it is a mere taste of the whip to rearing coursers ,
which makes them rear worse ! When a team of Twenty @-@ five Millions begins
rearing , what is Lomenie &apos;s whip ? The Parlement will nowise acquiesce
meekly ; and set to register the Protestant Edict , and do its other work ,
in salutary fear of these three Lettres @-@ de @-@ Cachet . Far from that ,
it begins questioning Lettres @-@ de @-@ Cachet generally , their legality ,
endurability ; emits dolorous objurgation , petition on petition to have
its three Martyrs delivered ; cannot , till that be complied with , so much
as think of examining the Protestant Edict , but puts it off always &apos; till
this day week . &apos; ( Besenval , iii . 309 . )

In which objurgatory strain Paris and France joins it , or rather has
preceded it ; making fearful chorus . And now also the other Parlements ,
at length opening their mouths , begin to join ; some of them , as at
Grenoble and at Rennes , with portentous emphasis , -- threatening , by way
of reprisal , to interdict the very Tax @-@ gatherer . ( Weber , i . 266 . ) &quot; In
all former contests , &quot; as Malesherbes remarks , &quot; it was the Parlement
that excited the Public ; but here it is the Public that excites the
Parlement . &quot;



Chapter 1.3.VII.

Internecine .

What a France , through these winter months of the year 1787 ! The very
Oeil @-@ de @-@ Boeuf is doleful , uncertain ; with a general feeling among the
Suppressed , that it were better to be in Turkey . The Wolf @-@ hounds are
suppressed , the Bear @-@ hounds , Duke de Coigny , Duke de Polignac : in the
Trianon little @-@ heaven , her Majesty , one evening , takes Besenval &apos;s arm ;
asks his candid opinion . The intrepid Besenval , -- having , as he hopes ,
nothing of the sycophant in him , -- plainly signifies that , with a
Parlement in rebellion , and an Oeil @-@ de @-@ Boeuf in suppression , the King &apos;s
Crown is in danger ; -- whereupon , singular to say , her Majesty , as if
hurt , changed the subject , et ne me parla plus de rien ! ( Besenval , iii .
264 . )

To whom , indeed , can this poor Queen speak ? In need of wise counsel ,
if ever mortal was ; yet beset here only by the hubbub of chaos ! Her
dwelling @-@ place is so bright to the eye , and confusion and black
care darkens it all . Sorrows of the Sovereign , sorrows of the
woman , think @-@ coming sorrows environ her more and more . Lamotte , the
Necklace @-@ Countess , has in these late months escaped , perhaps been
suffered to escape , from the Salpetriere . Vain was the hope that Paris
might thereby forget her ; and this ever @-@ widening @-@ lie , and heap of lies ,
subside . The Lamotte , with a V ( for Voleuse , Thief ) branded on both
shoulders , has got to England ; and will therefrom emit lie on lie ;
defiling the highest queenly name : mere distracted lies ; ( Memoires
justificatifs de la Comtesse de Lamotte ( London , 1788 ) . Vie de Jeanne de
St. Remi , Comtesse de Lamotte , &amp; c . &amp; c . See Diamond Necklace ( ut supra ) . )
which , in its present humour , France will greedily believe .

For the rest , it is too clear our Successive Loan is not filling .
As indeed , in such circumstances , a Loan registered by expunging
of Protests was not the likeliest to fill . Denunciation of
Lettres @-@ de @-@ Cachet , of Despotism generally , abates not : the Twelve
Parlements are busy ; the Twelve hundred Placarders , Balladsingers ,
Pamphleteers . Paris is what , in figurative speech , they call &apos; flooded
with pamphlets ( regorge de brochures ) ; &apos; flooded and eddying again .
Hot deluge , -- from so many Patriot ready @-@ writers , all at the fervid or
boiling point ; each ready @-@ writer , now in the hour of eruption , going
like an Iceland Geyser ! Against which what can a judicious friend
Morellet do ; a Rivarol , an unruly Linguet ( well paid for it ) , -- spouting
cold !

Now also , at length , does come discussion of the Protestant Edict : but
only for new embroilment ; in pamphlet and counter @-@ pamphlet , increasing
the madness of men . Not even Orthodoxy , bedrid as she seemed , but will
have a hand in this confusion . She , once again in the shape of Abbe
Lenfant , &apos; whom Prelates drive to visit and congratulate , &apos; -- raises
audible sound from her pulpit @-@ drum . ( Lacretelle , iii . 343 . Montgaillard ,
&amp; c . ) Or mark how D &apos;Espremenil , who has his own confused way in all
things , produces at the right moment in Parlementary harangue , a pocket
Crucifix , with the apostrophe : &quot; Will ye crucify him afresh ? &quot; Him , O
D &apos;Espremenil , without scruple ; -- considering what poor stuff , of ivory
and filigree , he is made of !

To all which add only that poor Brienne has fallen sick ; so hard was
the tear and wear of his sinful youth , so violent , incessant is this
agitation of his foolish old age . Baited , bayed at through so many
throats , his Grace , growing consumptive , inflammatory ( with humeur
de dartre ) , lies reduced to milk diet ; in exasperation , almost in
desperation ; with &apos; repose , &apos; precisely the impossible recipe , prescribed
as the indispensable . ( Besenval , iii . 317 . )

On the whole , what can a poor Government do , but once more recoil
ineffectual ? The King &apos;s Treasury is running towards the lees ; and Paris
&apos;eddies with a flood of pamphlets . &apos; At all rates , let the latter subside
a little ! D &apos;Orleans gets back to Raincy , which is nearer Paris and
the fair frail Buffon ; finally to Paris itself : neither are Freteau and
Sabatier banished forever . The Protestant Edict is registered ; to
the joy of Boissy d &apos;Anglas and good Malesherbes : Successive Loan , all
protests expunged or else withdrawn , remains open , -- the rather as few
or none come to fill it . States @-@ General , for which the Parlement has
clamoured , and now the whole Nation clamours , will follow &apos; in five
years , &apos; -- if indeed not sooner . O Parlement of Paris , what a clamour was
that ! &quot; Messieurs , &quot; said old d &apos;Ormesson , &quot; you will get States @-@ General ,
and you will repent it . &quot; Like the Horse in the Fable , who , to be avenged
of his enemy , applied to the Man . The Man mounted ; did swift execution
on the enemy ; but , unhappily , would not dismount ! Instead of five years ,
let three years pass , and this clamorous Parlement shall have both seen
its enemy hurled prostrate , and been itself ridden to foundering ( say
rather , jugulated for hide and shoes ) , and lie dead in the ditch .

Under such omens , however , we have reached the spring of 1788 . By
no path can the King &apos;s Government find passage for itself , but is
everywhere shamefully flung back . Beleaguered by Twelve rebellious
Parlements , which are grown to be the organs of an angry Nation , it can
advance nowhither ; can accomplish nothing , obtain nothing , not so much
as money to subsist on ; but must sit there , seemingly , to be eaten up of
Deficit .

The measure of the Iniquity , then , of the Falsehood which has been
gathering through long centuries , is nearly full ? At least , that of
the misery is ! For the hovels of the Twenty @-@ five Millions , the misery ,
permeating upwards and forwards , as its law is , has got so far , -- to the
very Oeil @-@ de @-@ Boeuf of Versailles . Man &apos;s hand , in this blind pain , is set
against man : not only the low against the higher , but the higher against
each other ; Provincial Noblesse is bitter against Court Noblesse ; Robe
against Sword ; Rochet against Pen . But against the King &apos;s Government
who is not bitter ? Not even Besenval , in these days . To it all men and
bodies of men are become as enemies ; it is the centre whereon infinite
contentions unite and clash . What new universal vertiginous movement is
this ; of Institution , social Arrangements , individual Minds , which once
worked cooperative ; now rolling and grinding in distracted collision ?
Inevitable : it is the breaking @-@ up of a World @-@ Solecism , worn out at last ,
down even to bankruptcy of money ! And so this poor Versailles Court ,
as the chief or central Solecism , finds all the other Solecisms arrayed
against it . Most natural ! For your human Solecism , be it Person or
Combination of Persons , is ever , by law of Nature , uneasy ; if verging
towards bankruptcy , it is even miserable : -- and when would the meanest
Solecism consent to blame or amend itself , while there remained another
to amend ?

These threatening signs do not terrify Lomenie , much less teach him .
Lomenie , though of light nature , is not without courage , of a sort . Nay ,
have we not read of lightest creatures , trained Canary @-@ birds , that
could fly cheerfully with lighted matches , and fire cannon ; fire whole
powder @-@ magazines ? To sit and die of deficit is no part of Lomenie &apos;s
plan . The evil is considerable ; but can he not remove it , can he not
attack it ? At lowest , he can attack the symptom of it : these rebellious
Parlements he can attack , and perhaps remove . Much is dim to Lomenie ,
but two things are clear : that such Parlementary duel with Royalty is
growing perilous , nay internecine ; above all , that money must be had .
Take thought , brave Lomenie ; thou Garde @-@ des @-@ Sceaux Lamoignon , who hast
ideas ! So often defeated , balked cruelly when the golden fruit seemed
within clutch , rally for one other struggle . To tame the Parlement , to
fill the King &apos;s coffers : these are now life @-@ and @-@ death questions .

Parlements have been tamed , more than once . Set to perch &apos; on the peaks
of rocks in accessible except by litters , &apos; a Parlement grows reasonable .
O Maupeou , thou bold man , had we left thy work where it was ! -- But apart
from exile , or other violent methods , is there not one method , whereby
all things are tamed , even lions ? The method of hunger ! What if the
Parlement &apos;s supplies were cut off ; namely its Lawsuits !

Minor Courts , for the trying of innumerable minor causes , might be
instituted : these we could call Grand Bailliages . Whereon the Parlement ,
shortened of its prey , would look with yellow despair ; but the Public ,
fond of cheap justice , with favour and hope . Then for Finance , for
registering of Edicts , why not , from our own Oeil @-@ de @-@ Boeuf Dignitaries ,
our Princes , Dukes , Marshals , make a thing we could call Plenary Court ;
and there , so to speak , do our registering ourselves ? St. Louis had his
Plenary Court , of Great Barons ; ( Montgaillard , i . 405 . ) most useful to
him : our Great Barons are still here ( at least the Name of them is still
here ) ; our necessity is greater than his .

Such is the Lomenie @-@ Lamoignon device ; welcome to the King &apos;s Council ,
as a light @-@ beam in great darkness . The device seems feasible , it is
eminently needful : be it once well executed , great deliverance is
wrought . Silent , then , and steady ; now or never ! -- the World shall see
one other Historical Scene ; and so singular a man as Lomenie de Brienne
still the Stage @-@ manager there .

Behold , accordingly , a Home @-@ Secretary Breteuil &apos; beautifying Paris , &apos; in
the peaceablest manner , in this hopeful spring weather of 1788 ; the old
hovels and hutches disappearing from our Bridges : as if for the
State too there were halcyon weather , and nothing to do but beautify .
Parlement seems to sit acknowledged victor . Brienne says nothing of
Finance ; or even says , and prints , that it is all well . How is this ;
such halcyon quiet ; though the Successive Loan did not fill ? In a
victorious Parlement , Counsellor Goeslard de Monsabert even denounces
that &apos; levying of the Second Twentieth on strict valuation ; &apos; and gets
decree that the valuation shall not be strict , -- not on the privileged
classes . Nevertheless Brienne endures it , launches no Lettre @-@ de @-@ Cachet
against it . How is this ?

Smiling is such vernal weather ; but treacherous , sudden ! For one thing ,
we hear it whispered , &apos; the Intendants of Provinces &apos; have all got order
to be at their posts on a certain day . &apos; Still more singular , what
incessant Printing is this that goes on at the King &apos;s Chateau , under
lock and key ? Sentries occupy all gates and windows ; the Printers come
not out ; they sleep in their workrooms ; their very food is handed in
to them ! ( Weber , i . 276 . ) A victorious Parlement smells new danger .
D &apos;Espremenil has ordered horses to Versailles ; prowls round that guarded
Printing @-@ Office ; prying , snuffing , if so be the sagacity and ingenuity
of man may penetrate it .

To a shower of gold most things are penetrable . D &apos;Espremenil descends on
the lap of a Printer &apos;s Danae , in the shape of &apos; five hundred louis d &apos;or : &apos;
the Danae &apos;s Husband smuggles a ball of clay to her ; which she delivers
to the golden Counsellor of Parlement . Kneaded within it , their
stick printed proof @-@ sheets ; -- by Heaven ! the royal Edict of that same
self @-@ registering Plenary Court ; of those Grand Bailliages that shall cut
short our Lawsuits ! It is to be promulgated over all France on one and
the same day .

This , then , is what the Intendants were bid wait for at their posts :
this is what the Court sat hatching , as its accursed cockatrice @-@ egg ; and
would not stir , though provoked , till the brood were out ! Hie with it ,
D &apos;Espremenil , home to Paris ; convoke instantaneous Sessions ; let the
Parlement , and the Earth , and the Heavens know it .



Chapter 1.3.VIII.

Lomenie &apos;s Death @-@ throes .

On the morrow , which is the 3rd of May , 1788 , an astonished Parlement
sits convoked ; listens speechless to the speech of D &apos;Espremenil ,
unfolding the infinite misdeed . Deed of treachery ; of unhallowed
darkness , such as Despotism loves ! Denounce it , O Parlement of Paris ;
awaken France and the Universe ; roll what thunder @-@ barrels of forensic
eloquence thou hast : with thee too it is verily Now or never !

The Parlement is not wanting , at such juncture . In the hour of his
extreme jeopardy , the lion first incites himself by roaring , by
lashing his sides . So here the Parlement of Paris . On the motion of
D &apos;Espremenil , a most patriotic Oath , of the One @-@ and @-@ all sort , is sworn ,
with united throat ; -- an excellent new @-@ idea , which , in these coming
years , shall not remain unimitated . Next comes indomitable Declaration ,
almost of the rights of man , at least of the rights of Parlement ;
Invocation to the friends of French Freedom , in this and in subsequent
time . All which , or the essence of all which , is brought to paper ; in a
tone wherein something of plaintiveness blends with , and tempers , heroic
valour . And thus , having sounded the storm @-@ bell , -- which Paris hears ,
which all France will hear ; and hurled such defiance in the teeth of
Lomenie and Despotism , the Parlement retires as from a tolerable first
day &apos;s work .

But how Lomenie felt to see his cockatrice @-@ egg ( so essential to the
salvation of France ) broken in this premature manner , let readers fancy !
Indignant he clutches at his thunderbolts ( de Cachet , of the Seal ) ;
and launches two of them : a bolt for D &apos;Espremenil ; a bolt for that busy
Goeslard , whose service in the Second Twentieth and &apos; strict valuation&apos;
is not forgotten . Such bolts clutched promptly overnight , and launched
with the early new morning , shall strike agitated Paris if not into
requiescence , yet into wholesome astonishment .

Ministerial thunderbolts may be launched ; but if they do not hit ?
D &apos;Espremenil and Goeslard , warned , both of them , as is thought , by
the singing of some friendly bird , elude the Lomenie Tipstaves ; escape
disguised through skywindows , over roofs , to their own Palais de
Justice : the thunderbolts have missed . Paris ( for the buzz flies abroad )
is struck into astonishment not wholesome . The two martyrs of Liberty
doff their disguises ; don their long gowns ; behold , in the space of
an hour , by aid of ushers and swift runners , the Parlement , with its
Counsellors , Presidents , even Peers , sits anew assembled . The assembled
Parlement declares that these its two martyrs cannot be given up , to any
sublunary authority ; moreover that the &apos; session is permanent , &apos; admitting
of no adjournment , till pursuit of them has been relinquished .

And so , with forensic eloquence , denunciation and protest , with couriers
going and returning , the Parlement , in this state of continual explosion
that shall cease neither night nor day , waits the issue . Awakened Paris
once more inundates those outer courts ; boils , in floods wilder than
ever , through all avenues . Dissonant hubbub there is ; jargon as of
Babel , in the hour when they were first smitten ( as here ) with mutual
unintelligibilty , and the people had not yet dispersed !

Paris City goes through its diurnal epochs , of working and slumbering ;
and now , for the second time , most European and African mortals are
asleep . But here , in this Whirlpool of Words , sleep falls not ; the Night
spreads her coverlid of Darkness over it in vain . Within is the sound of
mere martyr invincibility ; tempered with the due tone of plaintiveness .
Without is the infinite expectant hum , -- growing drowsier a little . So
has it lasted for six @-@ and @-@ thirty hours .

But hark , through the dead of midnight , what tramp is this ? Tramp as of
armed men , foot and horse ; Gardes Francaises , Gardes Suisses : marching
hither ; in silent regularity ; in the flare of torchlight ! There are
Sappers , too , with axes and crowbars : apparently , if the doors open not ,
they will be forced ! -- It is Captain D &apos;Agoust , missioned from Versailles .
D &apos;Agoust , a man of known firmness ; -- who once forced Prince Conde
himself , by mere incessant looking at him , to give satisfaction and
fight ; ( Weber , i . 283 . ) he now , with axes and torches is advancing on
the very sanctuary of Justice . Sacrilegious ; yet what help ? The man is
a soldier ; looks merely at his orders ; impassive , moves forward like an
inanimate engine .

The doors open on summons , there need no axes ; door after door . And now
the innermost door opens ; discloses the long @-@ gowned Senators of France :
a hundred and sixty @-@ seven by tale , seventeen of them Peers ; sitting
there , majestic , &apos; in permanent session . &apos; Were not the men military , and
of cast @-@ iron , this sight , this silence reechoing the clank of his own
boots , might stagger him ! For the hundred and sixty @-@ seven receive him in
perfect silence ; which some liken to that of the Roman Senate overfallen
by Brennus ; some to that of a nest of coiners surprised by officers of
the Police . ( Besenval , iii . 355 . ) Messieurs , said D &apos;Agoust , De par le
Roi ! Express order has charged D &apos;Agoust with the sad duty of arresting
two individuals : M. Duval d &apos;Espremenil and M. Goeslard de Monsabert .
Which respectable individuals , as he has not the honour of knowing
them , are hereby invited , in the King &apos;s name , to surrender
themselves . -- Profound silence ! Buzz , which grows a murmur : &quot; We are
all D &apos;Espremenils ! &quot; ventures a voice ; which other voices repeat . The
President inquires , Whether he will employ violence ? Captain D &apos;Agoust ,
honoured with his Majesty &apos;s commission , has to execute his Majesty &apos;s
order ; would so gladly do it without violence , will in any case do it ;
grants an august Senate space to deliberate which method they prefer .
And thereupon D &apos;Agoust , with grave military courtesy , has withdrawn for
the moment .

What boots it , august Senators ? All avenues are closed with fixed
bayonets . Your Courier gallops to Versailles , through the dewy Night ;
but also gallops back again , with tidings that the order is authentic ,
that it is irrevocable . The outer courts simmer with idle population ;
but D &apos;Agoust &apos;s grenadier @-@ ranks stand there as immovable floodgates :
there will be no revolting to deliver you . &quot; Messieurs ! &quot; thus spoke
D &apos;Espremenil , &quot; when the victorious Gauls entered Rome , which they had
carried by assault , the Roman Senators , clothed in their purple , sat
there , in their curule chairs , with a proud and tranquil countenance ,
awaiting slavery or death . Such too is the lofty spectacle , which
you , in this hour , offer to the universe ( a l &apos;univers ) , after having
generously &quot; -- with much more of the like , as can still be read .
( Toulongeon , i . App . 20 . )

In vain , O D &apos;Espremenil ! Here is this cast @-@ iron Captain D &apos;Agoust ,
with his cast @-@ iron military air , come back . Despotism , constraint ,
destruction sit waving in his plumes . D &apos;Espremenil must fall silent ;
heroically give himself up , lest worst befall . Him Goeslard heroically
imitates . With spoken and speechless emotion , they fling themselves into
the arms of their Parlementary brethren , for a last embrace : and so
amid plaudits and plaints , from a hundred and sixty @-@ five throats ; amid
wavings , sobbings , a whole forest @-@ sigh of Parlementary pathos , -- they are
led through winding passages , to the rear @-@ gate ; where , in the gray of
the morning , two Coaches with Exempts stand waiting . There must the
victims mount ; bayonets menacing behind . D &apos;Espremenil &apos;s stern question
to the populace , &apos; Whether they have courage ? &apos; is answered by silence .
They mount , and roll ; and neither the rising of the May sun ( it is the
6th morning ) , nor its setting shall lighten their heart : but they fare
forward continually ; D &apos;Espremenil towards the utmost Isles of Sainte
Marguerite , or Hieres ( supposed by some , if that is any comfort , to be
Calypso &apos;s Island ) ; Goeslard towards the land @-@ fortress of Pierre @-@ en @-@ Cize ,
extant then , near the City of Lyons .

Captain D &apos;Agoust may now therefore look forward to Majorship , to
Commandantship of the Tuilleries ; ( Montgaillard , i . 404 . ) -- and withal
vanish from History ; where nevertheless he has been fated to do a
notable thing . For not only are D &apos;Espremenil and Goeslard safe whirling
southward , but the Parlement itself has straightway to march out : to
that also his inexorable order reaches . Gathering up their long skirts ,
they file out , the whole Hundred and Sixty @-@ five of them , through two
rows of unsympathetic grenadiers : a spectacle to gods and men . The
people revolt not ; they only wonder and grumble : also , we remark , these
unsympathetic grenadiers are Gardes Francaises , -- who , one day , will
sympathise ! In a word , the Palais de Justice is swept clear , the doors
of it are locked ; and D &apos;Agoust returns to Versailles with the key in his
pocket , -- having , as was said , merited preferment .

As for this Parlement of Paris , now turned out to the street , we
will without reluctance leave it there . The Beds of Justice it had to
undergo , in the coming fortnight , at Versailles , in registering , or
rather refusing to register , those new @-@ hatched Edicts ; and how it
assembled in taverns and tap @-@ rooms there , for the purpose of Protesting ,
( Weber , i . 299 @-@ 303 . ) or hovered disconsolate , with outspread skirts ,
not knowing where to assemble ; and was reduced to lodge Protest &apos; with a
Notary ; &apos; and in the end , to sit still ( in a state of forced &apos; vacation &apos; ) ,
and do nothing ; all this , natural now , as the burying of the dead after
battle , shall not concern us . The Parlement of Paris has as good as
performed its part ; doing and misdoing , so far , but hardly further ,
could it stir the world .

Lomenie has removed the evil then ? Not at all : not so much as the
symptom of the evil ; scarcely the twelfth part of the symptom , and
exasperated the other eleven ! The Intendants of Provinces , the Military
Commandants are at their posts , on the appointed 8th of May : but in no
Parlement , if not in the single one of Douai , can these new Edicts
get registered . Not peaceable signing with ink ; but browbeating ,
bloodshedding , appeal to primary club @-@ law ! Against these Bailliages ,
against this Plenary Court , exasperated Themis everywhere shows face
of battle ; the Provincial Noblesse are of her party , and whoever hates
Lomenie and the evil time ; with her attorneys and Tipstaves , she enlists
and operates down even to the populace . At Rennes in Brittany , where the
historical Bertrand de Moleville is Intendant , it has passed from fatal
continual duelling , between the military and gentry , to street @-@ fighting ;
to stone @-@ volleys and musket @-@ shot : and still the Edicts remained
unregistered . The afflicted Bretons send remonstrance to Lomenie , by a
Deputation of Twelve ; whom , however , Lomenie , having heard them , shuts
up in the Bastille . A second larger deputation he meets , by his scouts ,
on the road , and persuades or frightens back . But now a third largest
Deputation is indignantly sent by many roads : refused audience on
arriving , it meets to take council ; invites Lafayette and all Patriot
Bretons in Paris to assist ; agitates itself ; becomes the Breton Club ,
first germ of -- the Jacobins &apos; Society . ( A. F. de Bertrand @-@ Moleville ,
Memoires Particuliers ( Paris , 1816 ) , I. ch. i . Marmontel , Memoires , iv .
27 . )

So many as eight Parlements get exiled : ( Montgaillard , i . 308 . ) others
might need that remedy , but it is one not always easy of appliance . At
Grenoble , for instance , where a Mounier , a Barnave have not been idle ,
the Parlement had due order ( by Lettres @-@ de @-@ Cachet ) to depart , and
exile itself : but on the morrow , instead of coaches getting yoked , the
alarm @-@ bell bursts forth , ominous ; and peals and booms all day : crowds
of mountaineers rush down , with axes , even with firelocks , -- whom ( most
ominous of all ! ) the soldiery shows no eagerness to deal with . &apos; Axe over
head , &apos; the poor General has to sign capitulation ; to engage that the
Lettres @-@ de @-@ Cachet shall remain unexecuted , and a beloved Parlement stay
where it is . Besancon , Dijon , Rouen , Bourdeaux , are not what they should
be ! At Pau in Bearn , where the old Commandant had failed , the new one
( a Grammont , native to them ) is met by a Procession of townsmen with the
Cradle of Henri Quatre , the Palladium of their Town ; is conjured as he
venerates this old Tortoise @-@ shell , in which the great Henri was rocked ,
not to trample on Bearnese liberty ; is informed , withal , that his
Majesty &apos;s cannon are all safe -- in the keeping of his Majesty &apos;s faithful
Burghers of Pau , and do now lie pointed on the walls there ; ready for
action ! ( Besenval , iii . 348 . )

At this rate , your Grand Bailliages are like to have a stormy infancy .
As for the Plenary Court , it has literally expired in the birth . The
very Courtiers looked shy at it ; old Marshal Broglie declined the honour
of sitting therein . Assaulted by a universal storm of mingled ridicule
and execration , ( La Cour Pleniere , heroi @-@ tragi @-@ comedie en trois actes et
en prose ; jouee le 14 Juillet 1788 , par une societe d &apos;amateurs dans un
Chateau aux environs de Versailles ; par M. l &apos;Abbe de Vermond , Lecteur de
la Reine : A Baville ( Lamoignon &apos;s Country @-@ house ) , et se trouve a Paris ,
chez la Veuve Liberte , a l &apos;enseigne de la Revolution , 1788 . -- La Passion ,
la Mort et la Resurrection du Peuple : Imprime a Jerusalem , &amp; c . &amp; c . -- See
Montgaillard , i . 407 . ) this poor Plenary Court met once , and never
any second time . Distracted country ! Contention hisses up , with
forked hydra @-@ tongues , wheresoever poor Lomenie sets his foot . &apos; Let a
Commandant , a Commissioner of the King , &apos; says Weber , &apos; enter one of
these Parlements to have an Edict registered , the whole Tribunal will
disappear , and leave the Commandant alone with the Clerk and First
President . The Edict registered and the Commandant gone , the whole
Tribunal hastens back , to declare such registration null . The highways
are covered with Grand Deputations of Parlements , proceeding to
Versailles , to have their registers expunged by the King &apos;s hand ; or
returning home , to cover a new page with a new resolution still more
audacious . &apos; ( Weber , i . 275 . )

Such is the France of this year 1788 . Not now a Golden or Paper Age of
Hope ; with its horse @-@ racings , balloon @-@ flyings , and finer sensibilities
of the heart : ah , gone is that ; its golden effulgence paled , bedarkened
in this singular manner , -- brewing towards preternatural weather ! For ,
as in that wreck @-@ storm of Paul et Virginie and Saint @-@ Pierre , -- &apos; One huge
motionless cloud &apos; ( say , of Sorrow and Indignation ) &apos; girdles our whole
horizon ; streams up , hairy , copper @-@ edged , over a sky of the colour of
lead . &apos; Motionless itself ; but &apos; small clouds &apos; ( as exiled Parlements and
suchlike ) , &apos; parting from it , fly over the zenith , with the velocity
of birds : &apos; -- till at last , with one loud howl , the whole Four Winds be
dashed together , and all the world exclaim , There is the tornado ! Tout
le monde s &apos;ecria , Voila l &apos;ouragan !

For the rest , in such circumstances , the Successive Loan , very
naturally , remains unfilled ; neither , indeed , can that impost of the
Second Twentieth , at least not on &apos; strict valuation , &apos; be levied to good
purpose : &apos; Lenders , &apos; says Weber , in his hysterical vehement manner , &apos; are
afraid of ruin ; tax @-@ gatherers of hanging . &apos; The very Clergy turn
away their face : convoked in Extraordinary Assembly , they afford no
gratuitous gift ( don gratuit ) , -- if it be not that of advice ; here too
instead of cash is clamour for States @-@ General . ( Lameth , Assemb . Const .
( Introd . ) p . 87 . )

O Lomenie @-@ Brienne , with thy poor flimsy mind all bewildered , and now
&apos;three actual cauteries &apos; on thy worn @-@ out body ; who art like to die of
inflamation , provocation , milk @-@ diet , dartres vives and maladie -- ( best
untranslated ) ; ( Montgaillard , i . 424 . ) and presidest over a France with
innumerable actual cauteries , which also is dying of inflammation and
the rest ! Was it wise to quit the bosky verdures of Brienne , and thy new
ashlar Chateau there , and what it held , for this ? Soft were those
shades and lawns ; sweet the hymns of Poetasters , the blandishments of
high @-@ rouged Graces : ( See Memoires de Morellet . ) and always this and
the other Philosophe Morellet ( nothing deeming himself or thee a
questionable Sham @-@ Priest ) could be so happy in making happy : -- and
also ( hadst thou known it ) , in the Military School hard by there sat ,
studying mathematics , a dusky @-@ complexioned taciturn Boy , under the
name of : NAPOLEON BONAPARTE ! -- With fifty years of effort , and one final
dead @-@ lift struggle , thou hast made an exchange ! Thou hast got thy robe
of office , -- as Hercules had his Nessus &apos; -shirt .

On the 13th of July of this 1788 , there fell , on the very edge of
harvest , the most frightful hailstorm ; scattering into wild waste the
Fruits of the Year ; which had otherwise suffered grievously by drought .
For sixty leagues round Paris especially , the ruin was almost total .
( Marmontel , iv . 30 . ) To so many other evils , then , there is to be added ,
that of dearth , perhaps of famine .

Some days before this hailstorm , on the 5th of July ; and still more
decisively some days after it , on the 8th of August , -- Lomenie announces
that the States @-@ General are actually to meet in the following month of
May . Till after which period , this of the Plenary Court , and the rest ,
shall remain postponed . Further , as in Lomenie there is no plan of
forming or holding these most desirable States @-@ General , &apos; thinkers are
invited &apos; to furnish him with one , -- through the medium of discussion by
the public press !

What could a poor Minister do ? There are still ten months of respite
reserved : a sinking pilot will fling out all things , his very
biscuit @-@ bags , lead , log , compass and quadrant , before flinging out
himself . It is on this principle , of sinking , and the incipient delirium
of despair , that we explain likewise the almost miraculous &apos; invitation
to thinkers . &apos; Invitation to Chaos to be so kind as build , out of its
tumultuous drift @-@ wood , an Ark of Escape for him ! In these cases , not
invitation but command has usually proved serviceable . -- The Queen stood ,
that evening , pensive , in a window , with her face turned towards the
Garden . The Chef de Gobelet had followed her with an obsequious cup of
coffee ; and then retired till it were sipped . Her Majesty beckoned Dame
Campan to approach : &quot; Grand Dieu ! &quot; murmured she , with the cup in her
hand , &quot; what a piece of news will be made public to @-@ day ! The King grants
States @-@ General . &quot; Then raising her eyes to Heaven ( if Campan were not
mistaken ) , she added : &quot; &apos; Tis a first beat of the drum , of ill @-@ omen for
France . This Noblesse will ruin us . &quot; ( Campan , iii . 104 , 111 . )

During all that hatching of the Plenary Court , while Lamoignon looked so
mysterious , Besenval had kept asking him one question : Whether they had
cash ? To which as Lamoignon always answered ( on the faith of Lomenie )
that the cash was safe , judicious Besenval rejoined that then all was
safe . Nevertheless , the melancholy fact is , that the royal coffers are
almost getting literally void of coin . Indeed , apart from all other
things this &apos; invitation to thinkers , &apos; and the great change now at hand
are enough to &apos; arrest the circulation of capital , &apos; and forward only that
of pamphlets . A few thousand gold louis are now all of money or money &apos;s
worth that remains in the King &apos;s Treasury . With another movement as
of desperation , Lomenie invites Necker to come and be Controller of
Finances ! Necker has other work in view than controlling Finances for
Lomenie : with a dry refusal he stands taciturn ; awaiting his time .

What shall a desperate Prime Minister do ? He has grasped at the
strongbox of the King &apos;s Theatre : some Lottery had been set on foot for
those sufferers by the hailstorm ; in his extreme necessity , Lomenie
lays hands even on this . ( Besenval , iii . 360 . ) To make provision for
the passing day , on any terms , will soon be impossible . -- On the 16th
of August , poor Weber heard , at Paris and Versailles , hawkers , &apos; with
a hoarse stifled tone of voice ( voix etouffee , sourde ) &apos; drawling and
snuffling , through the streets , an Edict concerning Payments ( such was
the soft title Rivarol had contrived for it ) : all payments at the
Royal Treasury shall be made henceforth , three @-@ fifths in Cash , and
the remaining two @-@ fifths -- in Paper bearing interest ! Poor Weber almost
swooned at the sound of these cracked voices , with their bodeful
raven @-@ note ; and will never forget the effect it had on him . ( Weber , i .
339 . )

But the effect on Paris , on the world generally ? From the dens of
Stock @-@ brokerage , from the heights of Political Economy , of Neckerism
and Philosophism ; from all articulate and inarticulate throats , rise
hootings and howlings , such as ear had not yet heard . Sedition itself
may be imminent ! Monseigneur d &apos;Artois , moved by Duchess Polignac , feels
called to wait upon her Majesty ; and explain frankly what crisis matters
stand in . &apos; The Queen wept ; &apos; Brienne himself wept ; -- for it is now visible
and palpable that he must go .

Remains only that the Court , to whom his manners and garrulities were
always agreeable , shall make his fall soft . The grasping old man has
already got his Archbishopship of Toulouse exchanged for the richer one
of Sens : and now , in this hour of pity , he shall have the Coadjutorship
for his nephew ( hardly yet of due age ) ; a Dameship of the Palace for his
niece ; a Regiment for her husband ; for himself a red Cardinal &apos;s @-@ hat , a
Coupe de Bois ( cutting from the royal forests ) , and on the whole &apos; from
five to six hundred thousand livres of revenue : &apos; ( Weber , i . 341 . )
finally , his Brother , the Comte de Brienne , shall still continue
War @-@ minister . Buckled @-@ round with such bolsters and huge featherbeds of
Promotion , let him now fall as soft as he can !

And so Lomenie departs : rich if Court @-@ titles and Money @-@ bonds can enrich
him ; but if these cannot , perhaps the poorest of all extant men . &apos; Hissed
at by the people of Versailles , &apos; he drives forth to Jardi ; southward
to Brienne , -- for recovery of health . Then to Nice , to Italy ; but shall
return ; shall glide to and fro , tremulous , faint @-@ twinkling , fallen on
awful times : till the Guillotine -- snuff out his weak existence ? Alas ,
worse : for it is blown out , or choked out , foully , pitiably , on the way
to the Guillotine ! In his Palace of Sens , rude Jacobin Bailiffs made him
drink with them from his own wine @-@ cellars , feast with them from his own
larder ; and on the morrow morning , the miserable old man lies dead . This
is the end of Prime Minister , Cardinal Archbishop Lomenie de Brienne .
Flimsier mortal was seldom fated to do as weighty a mischief ; to have
a life as despicable @-@ envied , an exit as frightful . Fired , as the phrase
is , with ambition : blown , like a kindled rag , the sport of winds ,
not this way , not that way , but of all ways , straight towards such a
powder @-@ mine , -- which he kindled ! Let us pity the hapless Lomenie ; and
forgive him ; and , as soon as possible , forget him .



Chapter 1.3.IX.

Burial with Bonfire .

Besenval , during these extraordinary operations , of Payment two @-@ fifths
in Paper , and change of Prime Minister , had been out on a tour through
his District of Command ; and indeed , for the last months , peacefully
drinking the waters of Contrexeville . Returning now , in the end of
August , towards Moulins , and &apos; knowing nothing , &apos; he arrives one evening
at Langres ; finds the whole Town in a state of uproar ( grande rumeur ) .
Doubtless some sedition ; a thing too common in these days ! He alights
nevertheless ; inquires of a &apos; man tolerably dressed , &apos; what the matter
is ? -- &quot; How ? &quot; answers the man , &quot; you have not heard the news ? The
Archbishop is thrown out , and M. Necker is recalled ; and all is going to
go well ! &quot; ( Besenval , iii . 366 . )

Such rumeur and vociferous acclaim has risen round M. Necker , ever
from &apos; that day when he issued from the Queen &apos;s Apartments , &apos; a nominated
Minister . It was on the 24th of August : &apos; the galleries of the Chateau ,
the courts , the streets of Versailles ; in few hours , the Capital ; and ,
as the news flew , all France , resounded with the cry of Vive le Roi !
Vive M. Necker ! ( Weber , i . 342 . ) In Paris indeed it unfortunately
got the length of turbulence . &apos; Petards , rockets go off , in the Place
Dauphine , more than enough . A &apos; wicker Figure ( Mannequin d &apos;osier ) , &apos;
in Archbishop &apos;s stole , made emblematically , three @-@ fifths of it satin ,
two @-@ fifths of it paper , is promenaded , not in silence , to the popular
judgment @-@ bar ; is doomed ; shriven by a mock Abbe de Vermond ; then
solemnly consumed by fire , at the foot of Henri &apos;s Statue on the Pont
Neuf ; -- with such petarding and huzzaing that Chevalier Dubois and his
City @-@ watch see good finally to make a charge ( more or less ineffectual ) ;
and there wanted not burning of sentry @-@ boxes , forcing of guard @-@ houses ,
and also &apos; dead bodies thrown into the Seine over @-@ night , &apos; to avoid new
effervescence . ( Histoire Parlementaire de la Revolution Francaise ; ou
Journal des Assemblees Nationales depuis 1789 ( Paris , 1833 et seqq . ) , i .
253 . Lameth , Assemblee Constituante , i . ( Introd . ) p . 89 . )

Parlements therefore shall return from exile : Plenary Court , Payment
two @-@ fifths in Paper have vanished ; gone off in smoke , at the foot of
Henri &apos;s Statue . States @-@ General ( with a Political Millennium ) are now
certain ; nay , it shall be announced , in our fond haste , for January
next : and all , as the Langres man said , is &apos; going to go . &apos; 

To the prophetic glance of Besenval , one other thing is too apparent :
that Friend Lamoignon cannot keep his Keepership . Neither he nor
War @-@ minister Comte de Brienne ! Already old Foulon , with an eye to be
war @-@ minister himself , is making underground movements . This is that same
Foulon named ame damnee du Parlement ; a man grown gray in treachery ,
in griping , projecting , intriguing and iniquity : who once when it
was objected , to some finance @-@ scheme of his , &quot; What will the people
do ? &quot; -- made answer , in the fire of discussion , &quot; The people may eat
grass : &quot; hasty words , which fly abroad irrevocable , -- and will send back
tidings !

Foulon , to the relief of the world , fails on this occasion ; and will
always fail . Nevertheless it steads not M. de Lamoignon . It steads not
the doomed man that he have interviews with the King ; and be &apos; seen to
return radieux , &apos; emitting rays . Lamoignon is the hated of Parlements :
Comte de Brienne is Brother to the Cardinal Archbishop . The 24th of
August has been ; and the 14th September is not yet , when they two , as
their great Principal had done , descend , -- made to fall soft , like him .

And now , as if the last burden had been rolled from its heart , and
assurance were at length perfect , Paris bursts forth anew into extreme
jubilee . The Basoche rejoices aloud , that the foe of Parlements is
fallen ; Nobility , Gentry , Commonalty have rejoiced ; and rejoice . Nay
now , with new emphasis , Rascality itself , starting suddenly from its dim
depths , will arise and do it , -- for down even thither the new Political
Evangel , in some rude version or other , has penetrated . It is Monday ,
the 14th of September 1788 : Rascality assembles anew , in great force ,
in the Place Dauphine ; lets off petards , fires blunderbusses , to an
incredible extent , without interval , for eighteen hours . There is again
a wicker Figure , &apos; Mannequin of osier : &apos; the centre of endless howlings .
Also Necker &apos;s Portrait snatched , or purchased , from some Printshop , is
borne processionally , aloft on a perch , with huzzas ; -- an example to be
remembered .

But chiefly on the Pont Neuf , where the Great Henri , in bronze , rides
sublime ; there do the crowds gather . All passengers must stop , till they
have bowed to the People &apos;s King , and said audibly : Vive Henri Quatre ;
au diable Lamoignon ! No carriage but must stop ; not even that of his
Highness d &apos;Orleans . Your coach @-@ doors are opened : Monsieur will please
to put forth his head and bow ; or even , if refractory , to alight
altogether , and kneel : from Madame a wave of her plumes , a smile of her
fair face , there where she sits , shall suffice ; -- and surely a coin
or two ( to buy fusees ) were not unreasonable from the Upper Classes ,
friends of Liberty ? In this manner it proceeds for days ; in such rude
horse @-@ play , -- not without kicks . The City @-@ watch can do nothing ; hardly
save its own skin : for the last twelve @-@ month , as we have sometimes seen ,
it has been a kind of pastime to hunt the Watch . Besenval indeed is at
hand with soldiers ; but they have orders to avoid firing , and are not
prompt to stir .

On Monday morning the explosion of petards began : and now it is
near midnight of Wednesday ; and the &apos; wicker Mannequin &apos; is to be
buried , -- apparently in the Antique fashion . Long rows of torches ,
following it , move towards the Hotel Lamoignon ; but &apos; a servant of mine&apos;
( Besenval &apos;s ) has run to give warning , and there are soldiers come .
Gloomy Lamoignon is not to die by conflagration , or this night ; not yet
for a year , and then by gunshot ( suicidal or accidental is unknown ) .
( Histoire de la Revolution , par Deux Amis de la Liberte , i . 50 . ) Foiled
Rascality burns its &apos; Mannikin of osier , &apos; under his windows ; &apos; tears up
the sentry @-@ box , &apos; and rolls off : to try Brienne ; to try Dubois Captain
of the Watch . Now , however , all is bestirring itself ; Gardes Francaises ,
Invalides , Horse @-@ patrol : the Torch Procession is met with sharp shot ,
with the thrusting of bayonets , the slashing of sabres . Even Dubois
makes a charge , with that Cavalry of his , and the cruelest charge of
all : &apos; there are a great many killed and wounded . &apos; Not without clangour ,
complaint ; subsequent criminal trials , and official persons dying of
heartbreak ! ( Histoire de la Revolution , par Deux Amis de la Liberte , i .
58 . ) So , however , with steel @-@ besom , Rascality is brushed back into its
dim depths , and the streets are swept clear .

Not for a century and half had Rascality ventured to step forth in this
fashion ; not for so long , showed its huge rude lineaments in the light
of day . A Wonder and new Thing : as yet gamboling merely , in awkward
Brobdingnag sport , not without quaintness ; hardly in anger : yet in its
huge half @-@ vacant laugh lurks a shade of grimness , -- which could unfold
itself !

However , the thinkers invited by Lomenie are now far on with their
pamphlets : States @-@ General , on one plan or another , will infallibly meet ;
if not in January , as was once hoped , yet at latest in May . Old Duke
de Richelieu , moribund in these autumn days , opens his eyes once more ,
murmuring , &quot; What would Louis Fourteenth &quot; ( whom he remembers ) &quot; have
said ! &quot; -- then closes them again , forever , before the evil time .




BOOK 1.IV.

STATES @-@ GENERAL


Chapter 1.4.I.

The Notables Again .

The universal prayer , therefore , is to be fulfilled ! Always in days of
national perplexity , when wrong abounded and help was not , this remedy
of States @-@ General was called for ; by a Malesherbes , nay by a Fenelon ;
( Montgaillard , i . 461 . ) even Parlements calling for it were &apos; escorted
with blessings . &apos; And now behold it is vouchsafed us ; States @-@ General
shall verily be !

To say , let States @-@ General be , was easy ; to say in what manner they
shall be , is not so easy . Since the year of 1614 , there have no
States @-@ General met in France , all trace of them has vanished from the
living habits of men . Their structure , powers , methods of procedure ,
which were never in any measure fixed , have now become wholly a vague
possibility . Clay which the potter may shape , this way or that : -- say
rather , the twenty @-@ five millions of potters ; for so many have now ,
more or less , a vote in it ! How to shape the States @-@ General ? There is a
problem . Each Body @-@ corporate , each privileged , each organised Class has
secret hopes of its own in that matter ; and also secret misgivings of
its own , -- for , behold , this monstrous twenty @-@ million Class , hitherto the
dumb sheep which these others had to agree about the manner of shearing ,
is now also arising with hopes ! It has ceased or is ceasing to be dumb ;
it speaks through Pamphlets , or at least brays and growls behind them ,
in unison , -- increasing wonderfully their volume of sound .

As for the Parlement of Paris , it has at once declared for the &apos; old
form of 1614 . &apos; Which form had this advantage , that the Tiers Etat , Third
Estate , or Commons , figured there as a show mainly : whereby the Noblesse
and Clergy had but to avoid quarrel between themselves , and decide
unobstructed what they thought best . Such was the clearly declared
opinion of the Paris Parlement . But , being met by a storm of mere
hooting and howling from all men , such opinion was blown straightway to
the winds ; and the popularity of the Parlement along with it , -- never
to return . The Parlements part , we said above , was as good as played .
Concerning which , however , there is this further to be noted : the
proximity of dates . It was on the 22nd of September that the Parlement
returned from &apos; vacation &apos; or &apos; exile in its estates ; &apos; to be reinstalled
amid boundless jubilee from all Paris . Precisely next day it was , that
this same Parlement came to its &apos; clearly declared opinion : &apos; and then on
the morrow after that , you behold it covered with outrages ; &apos; its outer
court , one vast sibilation , and the glory departed from it for evermore .
( Weber , i . 347 . ) A popularity of twenty @-@ four hours was , in those times ,
no uncommon allowance .

On the other hand , how superfluous was that invitation of Lomenie &apos;s :
the invitation to thinkers ! Thinkers and unthinkers , by the million ,
are spontaneously at their post , doing what is in them . Clubs labour :
Societe Publicole ; Breton Club ; Enraged Club , Club des Enrages . Likewise
Dinner @-@ parties in the Palais Royal ; your Mirabeaus , Talleyrands dining
there , in company with Chamforts , Morellets , with Duponts and
hot Parlementeers , not without object ! For a certain Neckerean
Lion &apos;s @-@ provider , whom one could name , assembles them there ; ( Ibid. i .
360 . ) -- or even their own private determination to have dinner does it .
And then as to Pamphlets -- in figurative language ; &apos; it is a sheer snowing
of pamphlets ; like to snow up the Government thoroughfares ! &apos; Now is the
time for Friends of Freedom ; sane , and even insane .

Count , or self @-@ styled Count , d &apos;Aintrigues , &apos; the young Languedocian
gentleman , &apos; with perhaps Chamfort the Cynic to help him , rises into
furor almost Pythic ; highest , where many are high . ( Memoire sur les
Etats @-@ Generaux . See Montgaillard , i . 457 @-@ 9 . ) Foolish young Languedocian
gentleman ; who himself so soon , &apos; emigrating among the foremost , &apos;
must fly indignant over the marches , with the Contrat Social in his
pocket , -- towards outer darkness , thankless intriguings , ignis @-@ fatuus
hoverings , and death by the stiletto ! Abbe Sieyes has left Chartres
Cathedral , and canonry and book @-@ shelves there ; has let his tonsure grow ,
and come to Paris with a secular head , of the most irrefragable sort ,
to ask three questions , and answer them : What is the Third
Estate ? All . -- What has it hitherto been in our form of government ?
Nothing . -- What does it want ? To become Something .

D &apos;Orleans , -- for be sure he , on his way to Chaos , is in the thick of
this , -- promulgates his Deliberations ; ( Deliberations a prendre pour les
Assemblees des Bailliages . ) fathered by him , written by Laclos of the
Liaisons Dangereuses . The result of which comes out simply : &apos; The Third
Estate is the Nation . &apos; On the other hand , Monseigneur d &apos;Artois , with
other Princes of the Blood , publishes , in solemn Memorial to the King ,
that if such things be listened to , Privilege , Nobility , Monarchy ,
Church , State and Strongbox are in danger . ( Memoire presente au Roi , par
Monseigneur Comte d &apos;Artois , M. le Prince de Conde , M. le Duc de Bourbon ,
M. le Duc d &apos;Enghien , et M. le Prince de Conti . ( Given in Hist . Parl. i .
256 . ) ) In danger truly : and yet if you do not listen , are they out
of danger ? It is the voice of all France , this sound that rises .
Immeasurable , manifold ; as the sound of outbreaking waters : wise were
he who knew what to do in it , -- if not to fly to the mountains , and hide
himself ?

How an ideal , all @-@ seeing Versailles Government , sitting there on such
principles , in such an environment , would have determined to demean
itself at this new juncture , may even yet be a question . Such a
Government would have felt too well that its long task was now drawing
to a close ; that , under the guise of these States @-@ General , at length
inevitable , a new omnipotent Unknown of Democracy was coming into being ;
in presence of which no Versailles Government either could or should ,
except in a provisory character , continue extant . To enact which
provisory character , so unspeakably important , might its whole
faculties but have sufficed ; and so a peaceable , gradual , well @-@ conducted
Abdication and Domine @-@ dimittas have been the issue !

This for our ideal , all @-@ seeing Versailles Government . But for the actual
irrational Versailles Government ? Alas , that is a Government existing
there only for its own behoof : without right , except possession ; and now
also without might . It foresees nothing , sees nothing ; has not so much
as a purpose , but has only purposes , -- and the instinct whereby all that
exists will struggle to keep existing . Wholly a vortex ; in which vain
counsels , hallucinations , falsehoods , intrigues , and imbecilities whirl ;
like withered rubbish in the meeting of winds ! The Oeil @-@ de @-@ Boeuf has its
irrational hopes , if also its fears . Since hitherto all States @-@ General
have done as good as nothing , why should these do more ? The Commons ,
indeed , look dangerous ; but on the whole is not revolt , unknown now
for five generations , an impossibility ? The Three Estates can , by
management , be set against each other ; the Third will , as heretofore ,
join with the King ; will , out of mere spite and self @-@ interest , be eager
to tax and vex the other two . The other two are thus delivered bound
into our hands , that we may fleece them likewise . Whereupon , money being
got , and the Three Estates all in quarrel , dismiss them , and let the
future go as it can ! As good Archbishop Lomenie was wont to say : &quot; There
are so many accidents ; and it needs but one to save us . &quot; -- How many to
destroy us ?

Poor Necker in the midst of such an anarchy does what is possible for
him . He looks into it with obstinately hopeful face ; lauds the known
rectitude of the kingly mind ; listens indulgent @-@ like to the known
perverseness of the queenly and courtly ; -- emits if any proclamation or
regulation , one favouring the Tiers Etat ; but settling nothing ; hovering
afar off rather , and advising all things to settle themselves . The
grand questions , for the present , have got reduced to two : the Double
Representation , and the Vote by Head . Shall the Commons have a &apos; double
representation , &apos; that is to say , have as many members as the Noblesse
and Clergy united ? Shall the States @-@ General , when once assembled , vote
and deliberate , in one body , or in three separate bodies ; &apos; vote by head ,
or vote by class , &apos; -- ordre as they call it ? These are the moot @-@ points now
filling all France with jargon , logic and eleutheromania . To terminate
which , Necker bethinks him , Might not a second Convocation of the
Notables be fittest ? Such second Convocation is resolved on .

On the 6th of November of this year 1788 , these Notables accordingly
have reassembled ; after an interval of some eighteen months . They are
Calonne &apos;s old Notables , the same Hundred and Forty @-@ four , -- to show one &apos;s
impartiality ; likewise to save time . They sit there once again , in their
Seven Bureaus , in the hard winter weather : it is the hardest winter seen
since 1709 ; thermometer below zero of Fahrenheit , Seine River frozen
over . ( Marmontel , Memoires ( London , 1805 ) , iv . 33 . Hist . Parl , &amp; c . )
Cold , scarcity and eleutheromaniac clamour : a changed world since these
Notables were &apos; organed out , &apos; in May gone a year ! They shall see now
whether , under their Seven Princes of the Blood , in their Seven Bureaus ,
they can settle the moot @-@ points .

To the surprise of Patriotism , these Notables , once so patriotic , seem
to incline the wrong way ; towards the anti @-@ patriotic side . They
stagger at the Double Representation , at the Vote by Head : there is not
affirmative decision ; there is mere debating , and that not with the best
aspects . For , indeed , were not these Notables themselves mostly of the
Privileged Classes ? They clamoured once ; now they have their misgivings ;
make their dolorous representations . Let them vanish , ineffectual ; and
return no more ! They vanish after a month &apos;s session , on this 12th of
December , year 1788 : the last terrestrial Notables , not to reappear any
other time , in the History of the World .

And so , the clamour still continuing , and the Pamphlets ; and nothing
but patriotic Addresses , louder and louder , pouting in on us from all
corners of France , -- Necker himself some fortnight after , before the year
is yet done , has to present his Report , ( Rapport fait au Roi dans son
Conseil , le 27 Decembre 1788 . ) recommending at his own risk that same
Double Representation ; nay almost enjoining it , so loud is the jargon
and eleutheromania . What dubitating , what circumambulating ! These whole
six noisy months ( for it began with Brienne in July , ) has not Report
followed Report , and one Proclamation flown in the teeth of the other ?
( 5th July ; 8th August ; 23rd September , &amp; c . &amp; c . )

However , that first moot @-@ point , as we see , is now settled . As for the
second , that of voting by Head or by Order , it unfortunately is still
left hanging . It hangs there , we may say , between the Privileged Orders
and the Unprivileged ; as a ready @-@ made battle @-@ prize , and necessity of
war , from the very first : which battle @-@ prize whosoever seizes it -- may
thenceforth bear as battle @-@ flag , with the best omens !

But so , at least , by Royal Edict of the 24th of January , ( Reglement du
Roi pour la Convocation des Etats @-@ Generaux a Versailles . ( Reprinted ,
wrong dated , in Histoire Parlementaire , i . 262 . ) ) does it finally , to
impatient expectant France , become not only indubitable that National
Deputies are to meet , but possible ( so far and hardly farther has the
royal Regulation gone ) to begin electing them .



Chapter 1.4.II.

The Election .

Up , then , and be doing ! The royal signal @-@ word flies through France , as
through vast forests the rushing of a mighty wind . At Parish Churches ,
in Townhalls , and every House of Convocation ; by Bailliages , by
Seneschalsies , in whatsoever form men convene ; there , with confusion
enough , are Primary Assemblies forming . To elect your Electors ; such
is the form prescribed : then to draw up your &apos; Writ of Plaints and
Grievances ( Cahier de plaintes et doleances ) , &apos; of which latter there is
no lack .

With such virtue works this Royal January Edict ; as it rolls rapidly ,
in its leathern mails , along these frostbound highways , towards all the
four winds . Like some fiat , or magic spell @-@ word ; -- which such things
do resemble ! For always , as it sounds out &apos; at the market @-@ cross , &apos;
accompanied with trumpet @-@ blast ; presided by Bailli , Seneschal , or other
minor Functionary , with beef @-@ eaters ; or , in country churches is
droned forth after sermon , &apos; au prone des messes paroissales ; &apos; and is
registered , posted and let fly over all the world , -- you behold how this
multitudinous French People , so long simmering and buzzing in eager
expectancy , begins heaping and shaping itself into organic groups . Which
organic groups , again , hold smaller organic grouplets : the inarticulate
buzzing becomes articulate speaking and acting . By Primary Assembly , and
then by Secondary ; by &apos; successive elections , &apos; and infinite elaboration
and scrutiny , according to prescribed process -- shall the genuine
&apos;Plaints and Grievances &apos; be at length got to paper ; shall the fit
National Representative be at length laid hold of .

How the whole People shakes itself , as if it had one life ; and , in
thousand @-@ voiced rumour , announces that it is awake , suddenly out of long
death @-@ sleep , and will thenceforth sleep no more ! The long looked @-@ for has
come at last ; wondrous news , of Victory , Deliverance , Enfranchisement ,
sounds magical through every heart . To the proud strong man it has come ;
whose strong hands shall no more be gyved ; to whom boundless unconquered
continents lie disclosed . The weary day @-@ drudge has heard of it ; the
beggar with his crusts moistened in tears . What ! To us also has hope
reached ; down even to us ? Hunger and hardship are not to be eternal ?
The bread we extorted from the rugged glebe , and , with the toil of our
sinews , reaped and ground , and kneaded into loaves , was not wholly for
another , then ; but we also shall eat of it , and be filled ? Glorious news
( answer the prudent elders ) , but all @-@ too unlikely ! -- Thus , at any rate ,
may the lower people , who pay no money @-@ taxes and have no right to vote ,
( Reglement du Roi in Histoire Parlementaire , as above , i . 267 @-@ 307 . )
assiduously crowd round those that do ; and most Halls of Assembly ,
within doors and without , seem animated enough .

Paris , alone of Towns , is to have Representatives ; the number of them
twenty . Paris is divided into Sixty Districts ; each of which ( assembled
in some church , or the like ) is choosing two Electors . Official
deputations pass from District to District , for all is inexperience as
yet , and there is endless consulting . The streets swarm strangely with
busy crowds , pacific yet restless and loquacious ; at intervals , is
seen the gleam of military muskets ; especially about the Palais , where
Parlement , once more on duty , sits querulous , almost tremulous .

Busy is the French world ! In those great days , what poorest speculative
craftsman but will leave his workshop ; if not to vote , yet to assist
in voting ? On all highways is a rustling and bustling . Over the wide
surface of France , ever and anon , through the spring months , as the
Sower casts his corn abroad upon the furrows , sounds of congregating and
dispersing ; of crowds in deliberation , acclamation , voting by ballot and
by voice , -- rise discrepant towards the ear of Heaven . To which political
phenomena add this economical one , that Trade is stagnant , and also
Bread getting dear ; for before the rigorous winter there was , as we
said , a rigorous summer , with drought , and on the 13th of July with
destructive hail . What a fearful day ! all cried while that tempest fell .
Alas , the next anniversary of it will be a worse . ( Bailly , Memoires , i .
336 . ) Under such aspects is France electing National Representatives .

The incidents and specialties of these Elections belong not to
Universal , but to Local or Parish History : for which reason let not the
new troubles of Grenoble or Besancon ; the bloodshed on the streets of
Rennes , and consequent march thither of the Breton &apos; Young Men &apos; with
Manifesto by their &apos; Mothers , Sisters and Sweethearts ; &apos; ( Protestation et
Arrete des Jeunes Gens de la Ville de Nantes , du 28 Janvier 1789 , avant
leur depart pour Rennes . Arrete des Jeunes Gens de la Ville d &apos;Angers , du
4 Fevrier 1789 . Arrete des Meres , Soeurs , Epouses et Amantes des
Jeunes Citoyens d &apos;Angers , du 6 Fevrier 1789 . ( Reprinted in Histoire
Parlementaire , i . 290 @-@ 3 . ) ) nor suchlike , detain us here . It is the
same sad history everywhere ; with superficial variations . A reinstated
Parlement ( as at Besancon ) , which stands astonished at this Behemoth of
a States @-@ General it had itself evoked , starts forward , with more or
less audacity , to fix a thorn in its nose ; and , alas , is instantaneously
struck down , and hurled quite out , -- for the new popular force can use
not only arguments but brickbats ! Or else , and perhaps combined with
this , it is an order of Noblesse ( as in Brittany ) , which will beforehand
tie up the Third Estate , that it harm not the old privileges . In which
act of tying up , never so skilfully set about , there is likewise no
possibility of prospering ; but the Behemoth @-@ Briareus snaps your cords
like green rushes . Tie up ? Alas , Messieurs ! And then , as for your
chivalry rapiers , valour and wager @-@ of @-@ battle , think one moment , how can
that answer ? The plebeian heart too has red life in it , which changes
not to paleness at glance even of you ; and &apos; the six hundred Breton
gentlemen assembled in arms , for seventy @-@ two hours , in the Cordeliers&apos;
Cloister , at Rennes , &apos; -- have to come out again , wiser than they entered .
For the Nantes Youth , the Angers Youth , all Brittany was astir ;
&apos;mothers , sisters and sweethearts &apos; shrieking after them , March ! The
Breton Noblesse must even let the mad world have its way . ( Hist . Parl .
i . 287 . Deux Amis de la Liberte , i . 105 @-@ 128 . )

In other Provinces , the Noblesse , with equal goodwill , finds it better
to stick to Protests , to well @-@ redacted &apos; Cahiers of grievances , &apos; and
satirical writings and speeches . Such is partially their course in
Provence ; whither indeed Gabriel Honore Riquetti Comte de Mirabeau has
rushed down from Paris , to speak a word in season . In Provence , the
Privileged , backed by their Aix Parlement , discover that such novelties ,
enjoined though they be by Royal Edict , tend to National detriment ;
and what is still more indisputable , &apos; to impair the dignity of the
Noblesse . &apos; Whereupon Mirabeau protesting aloud , this same Noblesse , amid
huge tumult within doors and without , flatly determines to expel him
from their Assembly . No other method , not even that of successive duels ,
would answer with him , the obstreperous fierce @-@ glaring man . Expelled he
accordingly is .

&apos;In all countries , in all times , &apos; exclaims he departing , &apos; the
Aristocrats have implacably pursued every friend of the People ; and
with tenfold implacability , if such a one were himself born of the
Aristocracy . It was thus that the last of the Gracchi perished , by the
hands of the Patricians . But he , being struck with the mortal stab ,
flung dust towards heaven , and called on the Avenging Deities ; and
from this dust there was born Marius , -- Marius not so illustrious for
exterminating the Cimbri , as for overturning in Rome the tyranny of the
Nobles . &apos; ( Fils Adoptif , v. 256 . ) Casting up which new curious handful
of dust ( through the Printing @-@ press ) , to breed what it can and may ,
Mirabeau stalks forth into the Third Estate .

That he now , to ingratiate himself with this Third Estate , &apos; opened a
cloth @-@ shop in Marseilles , &apos; and for moments became a furnishing tailor ,
or even the fable that he did so , is to us always among the pleasant
memorabilities of this era . Stranger Clothier never wielded the
ell @-@ wand , and rent webs for men , or fractional parts of men . The Fils
Adoptif is indignant at such disparaging fable , ( Memoires de Mirabeau ,
v. 307 . ) -- which nevertheless was widely believed in those days . ( Marat ,
Ami @-@ du @-@ Peuple Newspaper ( in Histoire Parlementaire , ii . 103 ) , &amp; c . ) But
indeed , if Achilles , in the heroic ages , killed mutton , why should not
Mirabeau , in the unheroic ones , measure broadcloth ?

More authentic are his triumph @-@ progresses through that disturbed
district , with mob jubilee , flaming torches , &apos; windows hired for two
louis , &apos; and voluntary guard of a hundred men . He is Deputy Elect ,
both of Aix and of Marseilles ; but will prefer Aix . He has opened his
far @-@ sounding voice , the depths of his far @-@ sounding soul ; he can quell
( such virtue is in a spoken word ) the pride @-@ tumults of the rich , the
hunger @-@ tumults of the poor ; and wild multitudes move under him , as under
the moon do billows of the sea : he has become a world compeller , and
ruler over men .

One other incident and specialty we note ; with how different an
interest ! It is of the Parlement of Paris ; which starts forward , like
the others ( only with less audacity , seeing better how it lay ) , to
nose @-@ ring that Behemoth of a States @-@ General . Worthy Doctor Guillotin ,
respectable practitioner in Paris , has drawn up his little &apos; Plan of
a Cahier of doleances ; &apos; -- as had he not , having the wish and gift , the
clearest liberty to do ? He is getting the people to sign it ; whereupon
the surly Parlement summons him to give an account of himself . He goes ;
but with all Paris at his heels ; which floods the outer courts , and
copiously signs the Cahier even there , while the Doctor is giving
account of himself within ! The Parlement cannot too soon dismiss
Guillotin , with compliments ; to be borne home shoulder @-@ high . ( Deux Amis
de la Liberte , i . 141 . ) This respectable Guillotin we hope to behold
once more , and perhaps only once ; the Parlement not even once , but let
it be engulphed unseen by us .

Meanwhile such things , cheering as they are , tend little to cheer the
national creditor , or indeed the creditor of any kind . In the midst of
universal portentous doubt , what certainty can seem so certain as money
in the purse , and the wisdom of keeping it there ? Trading Speculation ,
Commerce of all kinds , has as far as possible come to a dead pause ; and
the hand of the industrious lies idle in his bosom . Frightful enough ,
when now the rigour of seasons has also done its part , and to scarcity
of work is added scarcity of food ! In the opening spring , there come
rumours of forestalment , there come King &apos;s Edicts , Petitions of bakers
against millers ; and at length , in the month of April -- troops of ragged
Lackalls , and fierce cries of starvation ! These are the thrice @-@ famed
Brigands : an actual existing quotity of persons : who , long reflected
and reverberated through so many millions of heads , as in concave
multiplying mirrors , become a whole Brigand World ; and , like a kind of
Supernatural Machinery wondrously move the Epos of the Revolution . The
Brigands are here : the Brigands are there ; the Brigands are coming ! Not
otherwise sounded the clang of Phoebus Apollos &apos;s silver bow , scattering
pestilence and pale terror ; for this clang too was of the imagination ;
preternatural ; and it too walked in formless immeasurability , having
made itself like to the Night ( Greek . ) !

But remark at least , for the first time , the singular empire of
Suspicion , in those lands , in those days . If poor famishing men shall ,
prior to death , gather in groups and crowds , as the poor fieldfares and
plovers do in bitter weather , were it but that they may chirp mournfully
together , and misery look in the eyes of misery ; if famishing men ( what
famishing fieldfares cannot do ) should discover , once congregated , that
they need not die while food is in the land , since they are many , and
with empty wallets have right hands : in all this , what need were there
of Preternatural Machinery ? To most people none ; but not to French
people , in a time of Revolution . These Brigands ( as Turgot &apos;s also were ,
fourteen years ago ) have all been set on ; enlisted , though without tuck
of drum , -- by Aristocrats , by Democrats , by D &apos;Orleans , D &apos;Artois , and
enemies of the public weal . Nay Historians , to this day , will prove
it by one argument : these Brigands pretending to have no victual ,
nevertheless contrive to drink , nay , have been seen drunk . ( Lacretelle ,
18me Siecle , ii . 155 . ) An unexampled fact ! But on the whole , may we not
predict that a people , with such a width of Credulity and of Incredulity
( the proper union of which makes Suspicion , and indeed unreason
generally ) , will see Shapes enough of Immortals fighting in its
battle @-@ ranks , and never want for Epical Machinery ?

Be this as it may , the Brigands are clearly got to Paris , in
considerable multitudes : ( Besenval , iii . 385 , &amp; c . ) with sallow faces ,
lank hair ( the true enthusiast complexion ) , with sooty rags ; and also
with large clubs , which they smite angrily against the pavement ! These
mingle in the Election tumult ; would fain sign Guillotin &apos;s Cahier ,
or any Cahier or Petition whatsoever , could they but write . Their
enthusiast complexion , the smiting of their sticks bodes little good
to any one ; least of all to rich master @-@ manufacturers of the Suburb
Saint @-@ Antoine , with whose workmen they consort .

But now also National Deputies from all ends of France are in Paris ,
with their commissions , what they call pouvoirs , or powers , in their
pockets ; inquiring , consulting ; looking out for lodgings at Versailles .
The States @-@ General shall open there , if not on the First , then surely on
the Fourth of May , in grand procession and gala . The Salle des Menus
is all new @-@ carpentered , bedizened for them ; their very costume has
been fixed ; a grand controversy which there was , as to &apos; slouch @-@ hats or
slouched @-@ hats , &apos; for the Commons Deputies , has got as good as adjusted .
Ever new strangers arrive ; loungers , miscellaneous persons , officers
on furlough , -- as the worthy Captain Dampmartin , whom we hope to be
acquainted with : these also , from all regions , have repaired hither , to
see what is toward . Our Paris Committees , of the Sixty Districts , are
busier than ever ; it is now too clear , the Paris Elections will be late .

On Monday , the 27th of April , Astronomer Bailly notices that the Sieur
Reveillon is not at his post . The Sieur Reveillon , &apos; extensive Paper
Manufacturer of the Rue St. Antoine ; &apos; he , commonly so punctual , is
absent from the Electoral Committee ; -- and even will never reappear
there . In those &apos; immense Magazines of velvet paper &apos; has aught befallen ?
Alas , yes ! Alas , it is no Montgolfier rising there to @-@ day ; but Drudgery ,
Rascality and the Suburb that is rising ! Was the Sieur Reveillon ,
himself once a journeyman , heard to say that &apos; a journeyman might live
handsomely on fifteen sous a @-@ day ? &apos; Some sevenpence halfpenny : &apos; tis a
slender sum ! Or was he only thought , and believed , to be heard saying
it ? By this long chafing and friction it would appear the National
temper has got electric .

Down in those dark dens , in those dark heads and hungry hearts , who
knows in what strange figure the new Political Evangel may have shaped
itself ; what miraculous &apos; Communion of Drudges &apos; may be getting formed !
Enough : grim individuals , soon waxing to grim multitudes , and other
multitudes crowding to see , beset that Paper @-@ Warehouse ; demonstrate ,
in loud ungrammatical language ( addressed to the passions too ) , the
insufficiency of sevenpence halfpenny a @-@ day . The City @-@ watch cannot
dissipate them ; broils arise and bellowings ; Reveillon , at his wits&apos;
end , entreats the Populace , entreats the authorities . Besenval , now
in active command , Commandant of Paris , does , towards evening , to
Reveillon &apos;s earnest prayer , send some thirty Gardes Francaises . These
clear the street , happily without firing ; and take post there for the
night in hope that it may be all over . ( Besenval , iii . 385 @-@ 8 . )

Not so : on the morrow it is far worse . Saint @-@ Antoine has arisen anew ,
grimmer than ever ; -- reinforced by the unknown Tatterdemalion Figures ,
with their enthusiast complexion and large sticks . The City , through all
streets , is flowing thitherward to see : &apos; two cartloads of paving @-@ stones ,
that happened to pass that way &apos; have been seized as a visible godsend .
Another detachment of Gardes Francaises must be sent ; Besenval and the
Colonel taking earnest counsel . Then still another ; they hardly , with
bayonets and menace of bullets , penetrate to the spot . What a sight ! A
street choked up , with lumber , tumult and the endless press of men .
A Paper @-@ Warehouse eviscerated by axe and fire : mad din of Revolt ;
musket @-@ volleys responded to by yells , by miscellaneous missiles ; by
tiles raining from roof and window , -- tiles , execrations and slain men !

The Gardes Francaises like it not , but have to persevere . All day
it continues , slackening and rallying ; the sun is sinking , and
Saint @-@ Antoine has not yielded . The City flies hither and thither : alas ,
the sound of that musket @-@ volleying booms into the far dining @-@ rooms
of the Chaussee d &apos;Antin ; alters the tone of the dinner @-@ gossip there .
Captain Dampmartin leaves his wine ; goes out with a friend or two , to
see the fighting . Unwashed men growl on him , with murmurs of &quot; A bas les
Aristocrates ( Down with the Aristocrats ) ; &quot; and insult the cross of St.
Louis ? They elbow him , and hustle him ; but do not pick his pocket ; -- as
indeed at Reveillon &apos;s too there was not the slightest stealing .
( Evenemens qui se sont passes sous mes yeux pendant la Revolution
Francaise , par A. H. Dampmartin ( Berlin , 1799 ) , i . 25 @-@ 27 . )

At fall of night , as the thing will not end , Besenval takes his
resolution : orders out the Gardes Suisses with two pieces of artillery .
The Swiss Guards shall proceed thither ; summon that rabble to depart ,
in the King &apos;s name . If disobeyed , they shall load their artillery with
grape @-@ shot , visibly to the general eye ; shall again summon ; if again
disobeyed , fire , -- and keep firing &apos; till the last man &apos; be in this manner
blasted off , and the street clear . With which spirited resolution , as
might have been hoped , the business is got ended . At sight of the lit
matches , of the foreign red @-@ coated Switzers , Saint @-@ Antoine dissipates ;
hastily , in the shades of dusk . There is an encumbered street ; there are
&apos;from four to five hundred &apos; dead men . Unfortunate Reveillon has found
shelter in the Bastille ; does therefrom , safe behind stone bulwarks ,
issue , plaint , protestation , explanation , for the next month . Bold
Besenval has thanks from all the respectable Parisian classes ; but finds
no special notice taken of him at Versailles , -- a thing the man of true
worth is used to . ( Besenval , iii . 389 . )

But how it originated , this fierce electric sputter and explosion ? From
D &apos;Orleans ! cries the Court @-@ party : he , with his gold , enlisted these
Brigands , -- surely in some surprising manner , without sound of drum : he
raked them in hither , from all corners ; to ferment and take fire ; evil
is his good . From the Court ! cries enlightened Patriotism : it is the
cursed gold and wiles of Aristocrats that enlisted them ; set them upon
ruining an innocent Sieur Reveillon ; to frighten the faint , and disgust
men with the career of Freedom .

Besenval , with reluctance , concludes that it came from &apos; the English , our
natural enemies . &apos; Or , alas , might not one rather attribute it to Diana
in the shape of Hunger ? To some twin Dioscuri , OPPRESSION and REVENGE ;
so often seen in the battles of men ? Poor Lackalls , all betoiled ,
besoiled , encrusted into dim defacement ; into whom nevertheless the
breath of the Almighty has breathed a living soul ! To them it is clear
only that eleutheromaniac Philosophism has yet baked no bread ; that
Patrioti Committee @-@ men will level down to their own level , and no lower .
Brigands , or whatever they might be , it was bitter earnest with them .
They bury their dead with the title of Defenseurs de la Patrie , Martyrs
of the good Cause .

Or shall we say : Insurrection has now served its Apprenticeship ; and
this was its proof @-@ stroke , and no inconclusive one ? Its next will be a
master @-@ stroke ; announcing indisputable Mastership to a whole astonished
world . Let that rock @-@ fortress , Tyranny &apos;s stronghold , which they name
Bastille , or Building , as if there were no other building , -- look to its
guns !

But , in such wise , with primary and secondary Assemblies , and Cahiers of
Grievances ; with motions , congregations of all kinds ; with much thunder
of froth @-@ eloquence , and at last with thunder of platoon @-@ musquetry , -- does
agitated France accomplish its Elections . With confused winnowing and
sifting , in this rather tumultuous manner , it has now ( all except
some remnants of Paris ) sifted out the true wheat @-@ grains of National
Deputies , Twelve Hundred and Fourteen in number ; and will forthwith open
its States @-@ General .



Chapter 1.4.IV.

The Procession .

On the first Saturday of May , it is gala at Versailles ; and Monday ,
fourth of the month , is to be a still greater day . The Deputies have
mostly got thither , and sought out lodgings ; and are now successively ,
in long well @-@ ushered files , kissing the hand of Majesty in the Chateau .
Supreme Usher de Breze does not give the highest satisfaction : we
cannot but observe that in ushering Noblesse or Clergy into the anointed
Presence , he liberally opens both his folding @-@ doors ; and on the other
hand , for members of the Third Estate opens only one ! However , there is
room to enter ; Majesty has smiles for all .

The good Louis welcomes his Honourable Members , with smiles of hope . He
has prepared for them the Hall of Menus , the largest near him ; and
often surveyed the workmen as they went on . A spacious Hall : with
raised platform for Throne , Court and Blood @-@ royal ; space for six hundred
Commons Deputies in front ; for half as many Clergy on this hand , and
half as many Noblesse on that . It has lofty galleries ; wherefrom dames
of honour , splendent in gaze d &apos;or ; foreign Diplomacies , and other
gilt @-@ edged white @-@ frilled individuals to the number of two thousand , -- may
sit and look . Broad passages flow through it ; and , outside the
inner wall , all round it . There are committee @-@ rooms , guard @-@ rooms ,
robing @-@ rooms : really a noble Hall ; where upholstery , aided by the
subject fine @-@ arts , has done its best ; and crimson tasseled cloths , and
emblematic fleurs @-@ de @-@ lys are not wanting .

The Hall is ready : the very costume , as we said , has been settled ; and
the Commons are not to wear that hated slouch @-@ hat ( chapeau clabaud ) ,
but one not quite so slouched ( chapeau rabattu ) . As for their manner of
working , when all dressed : for their &apos; voting by head or by order &apos; and
the rest , -- this , which it were perhaps still time to settle , and in few
hours will be no longer time , remains unsettled ; hangs dubious in the
breast of Twelve Hundred men .

But now finally the Sun , on Monday the 4th of May , has
risen ; -- unconcerned , as if it were no special day . And yet , as his first
rays could strike music from the Memnon &apos;s Statue on the Nile , what tones
were these , so thrilling , tremulous of preparation and foreboding , which
he awoke in every bosom at Versailles ! Huge Paris , in all conceivable
and inconceivable vehicles , is pouring itself forth ; from each Town
and Village come subsidiary rills ; Versailles is a very sea of men . But
above all , from the Church of St. Louis to the Church of Notre @-@ Dame :
one vast suspended @-@ billow of Life , -- with spray scattered even to
the chimney @-@ pots ! For on chimney @-@ tops too , as over the roofs , and up
thitherwards on every lamp @-@ iron , sign @-@ post , breakneck coign of vantage ,
sits patriotic Courage ; and every window bursts with patriotic Beauty :
for the Deputies are gathering at St. Louis Church ; to march in
procession to Notre @-@ Dame , and hear sermon .

Yes , friends , ye may sit and look : boldly or in thought , all France , and
all Europe , may sit and look ; for it is a day like few others . Oh , one
might weep like Xerxes : -- So many serried rows sit perched there ; like
winged creatures , alighted out of Heaven : all these , and so many more
that follow them , shall have wholly fled aloft again , vanishing into
the blue Deep ; and the memory of this day still be fresh . It is the
baptism @-@ day of Democracy ; sick Time has given it birth , the numbered
months being run . The extreme @-@ unction day of Feudalism ! A superannuated
System of Society , decrepit with toils ( for has it not done much ;
produced you , and what ye have and know ! ) -- and with thefts and brawls ,
named glorious @-@ victories ; and with profligacies , sensualities , and
on the whole with dotage and senility , -- is now to die : and so , with
death @-@ throes and birth @-@ throes , a new one is to be born . What a work ,
O Earth and Heavens , what a work ! Battles and bloodshed , September
Massacres , Bridges of Lodi , retreats of Moscow , Waterloos , Peterloos ,
Tenpound Franchises , Tarbarrels and Guillotines ; -- and from this present
date , if one might prophesy , some two centuries of it still to fight !
Two centuries ; hardly less ; before Democracy go through its due , most
baleful , stages of Quackocracy ; and a pestilential World be burnt up ,
and have begun to grow green and young again .

Rejoice nevertheless , ye Versailles multitudes ; to you , from whom all
this is hid , and glorious end of it is visible . This day , sentence of
death is pronounced on Shams ; judgment of resuscitation , were it but far
off , is pronounced on Realities . This day it is declared aloud , as with
a Doom @-@ trumpet , that a Lie is unbelievable . Believe that , stand by that ,
if more there be not ; and let what thing or things soever will follow it
follow . &apos; Ye can no other ; God be your help ! &apos; So spake a greater than any
of you ; opening his Chapter of World @-@ History .

Behold , however ! The doors of St. Louis Church flung wide ; and the
Procession of Processions advancing towards Notre @-@ Dame ! Shouts rend the
air ; one shout , at which Grecian birds might drop dead . It is indeed
a stately , solemn sight . The Elected of France , and then the Court of
France ; they are marshalled and march there , all in prescribed place and
costume . Our Commons &apos; in plain black mantle and white cravat ; &apos; Noblesse ,
in gold @-@ worked , bright @-@ dyed cloaks of velvet , resplendent , rustling
with laces , waving with plumes ; the Clergy in rochet , alb , or other best
pontificalibus : lastly comes the King himself , and King &apos;s Household ,
also in their brightest blaze of pomp , -- their brightest and final one .
Some Fourteen Hundred Men blown together from all winds , on the deepest
errand .

Yes , in that silent marching mass there lies Futurity enough . No
symbolic Ark , like the old Hebrews , do these men bear : yet with them too
is a Covenant ; they too preside at a new Era in the History of Men . The
whole Future is there , and Destiny dim @-@ brooding over it ; in the hearts
and unshaped thoughts of these men , it lies illegible , inevitable .
Singular to think : they have it in them ; yet not they , not mortal ,
only the Eye above can read it , -- as it shall unfold itself , in fire
and thunder , of siege , and field @-@ artillery ; in the rustling of
battle @-@ banners , the tramp of hosts , in the glow of burning cities , the
shriek of strangled nations ! Such things lie hidden , safe @-@ wrapt in this
Fourth day of May ; -- say rather , had lain in some other unknown day ,
of which this latter is the public fruit and outcome . As indeed what
wonders lie in every Day , -- had we the sight , as happily we have not ,
to decipher it : for is not every meanest Day &apos; the conflux of two
Eternities ! &apos;

Meanwhile , suppose we too , good Reader , should , as now without miracle
Muse Clio enables us -- take our station also on some coign of vantage ;
and glance momentarily over this Procession , and this Life @-@ sea ; with far
other eyes than the rest do , namely with prophetic ? We can mount , and
stand there , without fear of falling .

As for the Life @-@ sea , or onlooking unnumbered Multitude , it is
unfortunately all @-@ too dim . Yet as we gaze fixedly , do not nameless
Figures not a few , which shall not always be nameless , disclose
themselves ; visible or presumable there ! Young Baroness de Stael -- she
evidently looks from a window ; among older honourable women . ( Madame
de Stael , Considerations sur la Revolution Francaise ( London , 1818 ) , i .
114 @-@ 191 . ) Her father is Minister , and one of the gala personages ; to his
own eyes the chief one . Young spiritual Amazon , thy rest is not there ;
nor thy loved Father &apos;s : &apos; as Malebranche saw all things in God , so M.
Necker sees all things in Necker , &apos; -- a theorem that will not hold .

But where is the brown @-@ locked , light @-@ behaved , fire @-@ hearted Demoiselle
Theroigne ? Brown eloquent Beauty ; who , with thy winged words and
glances , shalt thrill rough bosoms , whole steel battalions , and persuade
an Austrian Kaiser , -- pike and helm lie provided for thee in due season ;
and , alas , also strait @-@ waistcoat and long lodging in the Salpetriere !
Better hadst thou staid in native Luxemburg , and been the mother of some
brave man &apos;s children : but it was not thy task , it was not thy lot .

Of the rougher sex how , without tongue , or hundred tongues , of iron ,
enumerate the notabilities ! Has not Marquis Valadi hastily quitted his
quaker broadbrim ; his Pythagorean Greek in Wapping , and the city of
Glasgow ? ( Founders of the French Republic ( London , 1798 ) , para Valadi . )
De Morande from his Courrier de l &apos;Europe ; Linguet from his Annales , they
looked eager through the London fog , and became Ex @-@ Editors , -- that they
might feed the guillotine , and have their due . Does Louvet ( of Faublas )
stand a @-@ tiptoe ? And Brissot , hight De Warville , friend of the Blacks ?
He , with Marquis Condorcet , and Claviere the Genevese &apos; have created the
Moniteur Newspaper , &apos; or are about creating it . Able Editors must give
account of such a day .

Or seest thou with any distinctness , low down probably , not in places of
honour , a Stanislas Maillard , riding @-@ tipstaff ( huissier a cheval ) of
the Chatelet ; one of the shiftiest of men ? A Captain Hulin of Geneva ,
Captain Elie of the Queen &apos;s Regiment ; both with an air of half @-@ pay ?
Jourdan , with tile @-@ coloured whiskers , not yet with tile @-@ beard ; an unjust
dealer in mules ? He shall be , in a few months , Jourdan the Headsman , and
have other work .

Surely also , in some place not of honour , stands or sprawls up
querulous , that he too , though short , may see , -- one squalidest bleared
mortal , redolent of soot and horse @-@ drugs : Jean Paul Marat of Neuchatel !
O Marat , Renovator of Human Science , Lecturer on Optics ; O thou
remarkablest Horseleech , once in D &apos;Artois &apos; Stables , -- as thy bleared soul
looks forth , through thy bleared , dull @-@ acrid , wo @-@ stricken face , what
sees it in all this ? Any faintest light of hope ; like dayspring after
Nova @-@ Zembla night ? Or is it but blue sulphur @-@ light , and spectres ; woe ,
suspicion , revenge without end ?

Of Draper Lecointre , how he shut his cloth @-@ shop hard by , and stepped
forth , one need hardly speak . Nor of Santerre , the sonorous Brewer from
the Faubourg St. Antoine . Two other Figures , and only two , we signalise
there . The huge , brawny , Figure ; through whose black brows , and rude
flattened face ( figure ecrasee ) , there looks a waste energy as of
Hercules not yet furibund , -- he is an esurient , unprovided Advocate ;
Danton by name : him mark . Then that other , his slight @-@ built comrade and
craft @-@ brother ; he with the long curling locks ; with the face of dingy
blackguardism , wondrously irradiated with genius , as if a naphtha @-@ lamp
burnt within it : that Figure is Camille Desmoulins . A fellow of infinite
shrewdness , wit , nay humour ; one of the sprightliest clearest souls in
all these millions . Thou poor Camille , say of thee what they may ,
it were but falsehood to pretend one did not almost love thee , thou
headlong lightly @-@ sparkling man ! But the brawny , not yet furibund Figure ,
we say , is Jacques Danton ; a name that shall be &apos; tolerably known in the
Revolution . &apos; He is President of the electoral Cordeliers District at
Paris , or about to be it ; and shall open his lungs of brass .

We dwell no longer on the mixed shouting Multitude : for now , behold , the
Commons Deputies are at hand !

Which of these Six Hundred individuals , in plain white cravat , that have
come up to regenerate France , might one guess would become their king ?
For a king or leader they , as all bodies of men , must have : be their
work what it may , there is one man there who , by character , faculty ,
position , is fittest of all to do it ; that man , as future not yet
elected king , walks there among the rest . He with the thick black locks ,
will it be ? With the hure , as himself calls it , or black boar &apos;s @-@ head ,
fit to be &apos; shaken &apos; as a senatorial portent ? Through whose shaggy
beetle @-@ brows , and rough @-@ hewn , seamed , carbuncled face , there look
natural ugliness , small @-@ pox , incontinence , bankruptcy , -- and burning
fire of genius ; like comet @-@ fire glaring fuliginous through
murkiest confusions ? It is Gabriel Honore Riquetti de Mirabeau , the
world @-@ compeller ; man @-@ ruling Deputy of Aix ! According to the Baroness de
Stael , he steps proudly along , though looked at askance here , and shakes
his black chevelure , or lion &apos;s @-@ mane ; as if prophetic of great deeds .

Yes , Reader , that is the Type @-@ Frenchman of this epoch ; as Voltaire
was of the last . He is French in his aspirations , acquisitions , in his
virtues , in his vices ; perhaps more French than any other man ; -- and
intrinsically such a mass of manhood too . Mark him well . The National
Assembly were all different without that one ; nay , he might say with the
old Despot : &quot; The National Assembly ? I am that . &quot;

Of a southern climate , of wild southern blood : for the Riquettis , or
Arighettis , had to fly from Florence and the Guelfs , long centuries ago ,
and settled in Provence ; where from generation to generation they have
ever approved themselves a peculiar kindred : irascible , indomitable ,
sharp @-@ cutting , true , like the steel they wore ; of an intensity and
activity that sometimes verged towards madness , yet did not reach
it . One ancient Riquetti , in mad fulfilment of a mad vow , chains two
Mountains together ; and the chain , with its &apos; iron star of five rays , &apos; is
still to be seen . May not a modern Riquetti unchain so much , and set it
drifting , -- which also shall be seen ?

Destiny has work for that swart burly @-@ headed Mirabeau ; Destiny has
watched over him , prepared him from afar . Did not his Grandfather , stout
Col. d &apos;Argent ( Silver @-@ Stock , so they named him ) , shattered and slashed
by seven @-@ and @-@ twenty wounds in one fell day lie sunk together on the
Bridge at Casano ; while Prince Eugene &apos;s cavalry galloped and regalloped
over him , -- only the flying sergeant had thrown a camp @-@ kettle over that
loved head ; and Vendome , dropping his spyglass , moaned out , &apos; Mirabeau
is dead , then ! &apos; Nevertheless he was not dead : he awoke to breathe , and
miraculous surgery ; -- for Gabriel was yet to be . With his silver stock
he kept his scarred head erect , through long years ; and wedded ; and
produced tough Marquis Victor , the Friend of Men . Whereby at last in the
appointed year 1749 , this long @-@ expected rough @-@ hewn Gabriel Honore did
likewise see the light : roughest lion &apos;s @-@ whelp ever littered of that
rough breed . How the old lion ( for our old Marquis too was lion @-@ like ,
most unconquerable , kingly @-@ genial , most perverse ) gazed wonderingly on
his offspring ; and determined to train him as no lion had yet been ! It
is in vain , O Marquis ! This cub , though thou slay him and flay him , will
not learn to draw in dogcart of Political Economy , and be a Friend of
Men ; he will not be Thou , must and will be Himself , another than Thou .
Divorce lawsuits , &apos; whole family save one in prison , and three @-@ score
Lettres @-@ de @-@ Cachet &apos; for thy own sole use , do but astonish the world .

Our Luckless Gabriel , sinned against and sinning , has been in the Isle
of Rhe , and heard the Atlantic from his tower ; in the Castle of If , and
heard the Mediterranean at Marseilles . He has been in the Fortress of
Joux ; and forty @-@ two months , with hardly clothing to his back , in the
Dungeon of Vincennes ; -- all by Lettre @-@ de @-@ Cachet , from his lion father .
He has been in Pontarlier Jails ( self @-@ constituted prisoner ) ; was noticed
fording estuaries of the sea ( at low water ) , in flight from the face of
men . He has pleaded before Aix Parlements ( to get back his wife ) ;
the public gathering on roofs , to see since they could not hear : &quot; the
clatter @-@ teeth ( claque @-@ dents ) ! &quot; snarles singular old Mirabeau ; discerning
in such admired forensic eloquence nothing but two clattering jaw @-@ bones ,
and a head vacant , sonorous , of the drum species .

But as for Gabriel Honore , in these strange wayfarings , what has he not
seen and tried ! From drill @-@ sergeants , to prime @-@ ministers , to foreign and
domestic booksellers , all manner of men he has seen . All manner of men
he has gained ; for at bottom it is a social , loving heart , that wild
unconquerable one : -- more especially all manner of women . From the
Archer &apos;s Daughter at Saintes to that fair young Sophie Madame Monnier ,
whom he could not but &apos; steal , &apos; and be beheaded for -- in effigy ! For
indeed hardly since the Arabian Prophet lay dead to Ali &apos;s admiration ,
was there seen such a Love @-@ hero , with the strength of thirty men . In
War , again , he has helped to conquer Corsica ; fought duels , irregular
brawls ; horsewhipped calumnious barons . In Literature , he has written on
Despotism , on Lettres @-@ de @-@ Cachet ; Erotics Sapphic @-@ Werterean , Obscenities ,
Profanities ; Books on the Prussian Monarchy , on Cagliostro , on Calonne ,
on the Water Companies of Paris : -- each book comparable , we will say ,
to a bituminous alarum @-@ fire ; huge , smoky , sudden ! The firepan , the
kindling , the bitumen were his own ; but the lumber , of rags , old wood
and nameless combustible rubbish ( for all is fuel to him ) , was gathered
from huckster , and ass @-@ panniers , of every description under heaven .
Whereby , indeed , hucksters enough have been heard to exclaim : Out upon
it , the fire is mine !

Nay , consider it more generally , seldom had man such a talent for
borrowing . The idea , the faculty of another man he can make his ; the
man himself he can make his . &quot; All reflex and echo ( tout de reflet et de
reverbere ) ! &quot; snarls old Mirabeau , who can see , but will not . Crabbed old
Friend of Men ! it is his sociality , his aggregative nature ; and will
now be the quality of all for him . In that forty @-@ years &apos; struggle against
despotism , &apos; he has gained the glorious faculty of self @-@ help , and yet
not lost the glorious natural gift of fellowship , of being helped . Rare
union ! This man can live self @-@ sufficing -- yet lives also in the life of
other men ; can make men love him , work with him : a born king of men !

But consider further how , as the old Marquis still snarls , he has &quot; made
away with ( hume , swallowed ) all Formulas ; &quot; -- a fact which , if we meditate
it , will in these days mean much . This is no man of system , then ; he is
only a man of instincts and insights . A man nevertheless who will glare
fiercely on any object ; and see through it , and conquer it : for he
has intellect , he has will , force beyond other men . A man not with
logic @-@ spectacles ; but with an eye ! Unhappily without Decalogue , moral
Code or Theorem of any fixed sort ; yet not without a strong living Soul
in him , and Sincerity there : a Reality , not an Artificiality , not a
Sham ! And so he , having struggled &apos; forty years against despotism , &apos;
and &apos; made away with all formulas , &apos; shall now become the spokesman of
a Nation bent to do the same . For is it not precisely the struggle
of France also to cast off despotism ; to make away with her old
formulas , -- having found them naught , worn out , far from the reality ? She
will make away with such formulas ; -- and even go bare , if need be , till
she have found new ones .

Towards such work , in such manner , marches he , this singular Riquetti
Mirabeau . In fiery rough figure , with black Samson @-@ locks under the
slouch @-@ hat , he steps along there . A fiery fuliginous mass , which could
not be choked and smothered , but would fill all France with smoke .
And now it has got air ; it will burn its whole substance , its whole
smoke @-@ atmosphere too , and fill all France with flame . Strange lot ! Forty
years of that smouldering , with foul fire @-@ damp and vapour enough , then
victory over that ; -- and like a burning mountain he blazes heaven @-@ high ;
and , for twenty @-@ three resplendent months , pours out , in flame and molten
fire @-@ torrents , all that is in him , the Pharos and Wonder @-@ sign of an
amazed Europe ; -- and then lies hollow , cold forever ! Pass on , thou
questionable Gabriel Honore , the greatest of them all : in the whole
National Deputies , in the whole Nation , there is none like and none
second to thee .

But now if Mirabeau is the greatest , who of these Six Hundred may be the
meanest ? Shall we say , that anxious , slight , ineffectual @-@ looking man ,
under thirty , in spectacles ; his eyes ( were the glasses off ) troubled ,
careful ; with upturned face , snuffing dimly the uncertain future @-@ time ;
complexion of a multiplex atrabiliar colour , the final shade of which
may be the pale sea @-@ green . ( See De Stael , Considerations ( ii . 142 ) ;
Barbaroux , Memoires , &amp; c . ) That greenish @-@ coloured ( verdatre ) individual
is an Advocate of Arras ; his name is Maximilien Robespierre . The son of
an Advocate ; his father founded mason @-@ lodges under Charles Edward , the
English Prince or Pretender . Maximilien the first @-@ born was thriftily
educated ; he had brisk Camille Desmoulins for schoolmate in the College
of Louis le Grand , at Paris . But he begged our famed Necklace @-@ Cardinal ,
Rohan , the patron , to let him depart thence , and resign in favour of a
younger brother . The strict @-@ minded Max departed ; home to paternal Arras ;
and even had a Law @-@ case there and pleaded , not unsuccessfully , &apos; in
favour of the first Franklin thunder @-@ rod . &apos; With a strict painful mind ,
an understanding small but clear and ready , he grew in favour with
official persons , who could foresee in him an excellent man of business ,
happily quite free from genius . The Bishop , therefore , taking counsel ,
appoints him Judge of his diocese ; and he faithfully does justice to
the people : till behold , one day , a culprit comes whose crime merits
hanging ; and the strict @-@ minded Max must abdicate , for his conscience
will not permit the dooming of any son of Adam to die . A strict @-@ minded ,
strait @-@ laced man ! A man unfit for Revolutions ? Whose small soul ,
transparent wholesome @-@ looking as small ale , could by no chance ferment
into virulent alegar , -- the mother of ever new alegar ; till all France
were grown acetous virulent ? We shall see .

Between which two extremes of grandest and meanest , so many grand and
mean roll on , towards their several destinies , in that Procession ! There
is Cazales , the learned young soldier ; who shall become the eloquent
orator of Royalism , and earn the shadow of a name . Experienced Mounier ,
experienced Malouet ; whose Presidential Parlementary experience the
stream of things shall soon leave stranded . A Petion has left his
gown and briefs at Chartres for a stormier sort of pleading ; has not
forgotten his violin , being fond of music . His hair is grizzled , though
he is still young : convictions , beliefs , placid @-@ unalterable are in that
man ; not hindmost of them , belief in himself . A Protestant @-@ clerical
Rabaut @-@ St.-Etienne , a slender young eloquent and vehement Barnave , will
help to regenerate France . There are so many of them young . Till thirty
the Spartans did not suffer a man to marry : but how many men here under
thirty ; coming to produce not one sufficient citizen , but a nation and
a world of such ! The old to heal up rents ; the young to remove
rubbish : -- which latter , is it not , indeed , the task here ?

Dim , formless from this distance , yet authentically there , thou noticest
the Deputies from Nantes ? To us mere clothes @-@ screens , with slouch @-@ hat
and cloak , but bearing in their pocket a Cahier of doleances with this
singular clause , and more such in it : &apos; That the master wigmakers of
Nantes be not troubled with new gild @-@ brethren , the actually
existing number of ninety @-@ two being more than sufficient ! &apos; ( Histoire
Parlementaire , i . 335 . ) The Rennes people have elected Farmer Gerard ,
&apos;a man of natural sense and rectitude , without any learning . &apos; He walks
there , with solid step ; unique , &apos; in his rustic farmer @-@ clothes ; &apos; which
he will wear always ; careless of short @-@ cloaks and costumes . The name
Gerard , or &apos; Pere Gerard , Father Gerard , &apos; as they please to call him ,
will fly far ; borne about in endless banter ; in Royalist satires ,
in Republican didactic Almanacks . ( Actes des Apotres ( by Peltier and
others ) ; Almanach du Pere Gerard ( by Collot d &apos;Herbois ) &amp; c . &amp; c . ) As
for the man Gerard , being asked once , what he did , after trial of it ,
candidly think of this Parlementary work , -- &quot; I think , &quot; answered he , &quot; that
there are a good many scoundrels among us . &quot; so walks Father Gerard ;
solid in his thick shoes , whithersoever bound .

And worthy Doctor Guillotin , whom we hoped to behold one other time ?
If not here , the Doctor should be here , and we see him with the eye
of prophecy : for indeed the Parisian Deputies are all a little late .
Singular Guillotin , respectable practitioner : doomed by a satiric
destiny to the strangest immortal glory that ever kept obscure mortal
from his resting @-@ place , the bosom of oblivion ! Guillotin can improve the
ventilation of the Hall ; in all cases of medical police and hygiene be
a present aid : but , greater far , he can produce his &apos; Report on the Penal
Code ; &apos; and reveal therein a cunningly devised Beheading Machine , which
shall become famous and world @-@ famous . This is the product of Guillotin &apos;s
endeavours , gained not without meditation and reading ; which product
popular gratitude or levity christens by a feminine derivative name , as
if it were his daughter : La Guillotine ! &quot; With my machine , Messieurs , I
whisk off your head ( vous fais sauter la tete ) in a twinkling , and you
have no pain ; &quot; -- whereat they all laugh . ( Moniteur Newspaper , of
December 1st , 1789 ( in Histoire Parlementaire ) . ) Unfortunate Doctor !
For two @-@ and @-@ twenty years he , unguillotined , shall near nothing but
guillotine , see nothing but guillotine ; then dying , shall through long
centuries wander , as it were , a disconsolate ghost , on the wrong side of
Styx and Lethe ; his name like to outlive Caesar &apos;s .

See Bailly , likewise of Paris , time @-@ honoured Historian of Astronomy
Ancient and Modern . Poor Bailly , how thy serenely beautiful
Philosophising , with its soft moonshiny clearness and thinness , ends in
foul thick confusion -- of Presidency , Mayorship , diplomatic Officiality ,
rabid Triviality , and the throat of everlasting Darkness ! Far was it to
descend from the heavenly Galaxy to the Drapeau Rouge : beside that fatal
dung @-@ heap , on that last hell @-@ day , thou must &apos; tremble , &apos; though only with
cold , &apos; de froid . &apos; Speculation is not practice : to be weak is not so
miserable ; but to be weaker than our task . Wo the day when they mounted
thee , a peaceable pedestrian , on that wild Hippogriff of a Democracy ;
which , spurning the firm earth , nay lashing at the very stars , no yet
known Astolpho could have ridden !

In the Commons Deputies there are Merchants , Artists , Men of Letters ;
three hundred and seventy @-@ four Lawyers ; ( Bouille , Memoires sur la
Revolution Francaise ( London , 1797 ) , i . 68 . ) and at least one Clergyman :
the Abbe Sieyes . Him also Paris sends , among its twenty . Behold him ,
the light thin man ; cold , but elastic , wiry ; instinct with the pride of
Logic ; passionless , or with but one passion , that of self @-@ conceit .
If indeed that can be called a passion , which , in its independent
concentrated greatness , seems to have soared into transcendentalism ;
and to sit there with a kind of godlike indifference , and look down
on passion ! He is the man , and wisdom shall die with him . This is the
Sieyes who shall be System @-@ builder , Constitution @-@ builder General ;
and build Constitutions ( as many as wanted ) skyhigh , -- which shall all
unfortunately fall before he get the scaffolding away . &quot; La Politique , &quot;
said he to Dumont , &quot; Polity is a science I think I have completed
( achevee ) . &quot; ( Dumont , Souvenirs sur Mirabeau , p . 64 . ) What things , O
Sieyes , with thy clear assiduous eyes , art thou to see ! But were it
not curious to know how Sieyes , now in these days ( for he is said to be
still alive ) ( A.D. 1834 . ) looks out on all that Constitution masonry ,
through the rheumy soberness of extreme age ? Might we hope , still with
the old irrefragable transcendentalism ? The victorious cause pleased the
gods , the vanquished one pleased Sieyes ( victa Catoni ) .

Thus , however , amid skyrending vivats , and blessings from every heart ,
has the Procession of the Commons Deputies rolled by .

Next follow the Noblesse , and next the Clergy ; concerning both of whom
it might be asked , What they specially have come for ? Specially , little
as they dream of it , to answer this question , put in a voice of thunder :
What are you doing in God &apos;s fair Earth and Task @-@ garden ; where whosoever
is not working is begging or stealing ? Wo , wo to themselves and to all ,
if they can only answer : Collecting tithes , Preserving game ! -- Remark ,
meanwhile , how D &apos;Orleans affects to step before his own Order , and
mingle with the Commons . For him are vivats : few for the rest , though
all wave in plumed &apos; hats of a feudal cut , &apos; and have sword on
thigh ; though among them is D &apos;Antraigues , the young Languedocian
gentleman , -- and indeed many a Peer more or less noteworthy .

There are Liancourt , and La Rochefoucault ; the liberal Anglomaniac
Dukes . There is a filially pious Lally ; a couple of liberal Lameths .
Above all , there is a Lafayette ; whose name shall be Cromwell @-@ Grandison ,
and fill the world . Many a &apos; formula &apos; has this Lafayette too made away
with ; yet not all formulas . He sticks by the Washington @-@ formula ; and by
that he will stick ; -- and hang by it , as by sure bower @-@ anchor hangs and
swings the tight war @-@ ship , which , after all changes of wildest weather
and water , is found still hanging . Happy for him ; be it glorious or not !
Alone of all Frenchmen he has a theory of the world , and right mind to
conform thereto ; he can become a hero and perfect character , were it
but the hero of one idea . Note further our old Parlementary
friend , Crispin @-@ Catiline d &apos;Espremenil . He is returned from the
Mediterranean Islands , a redhot royalist , repentant to the
finger @-@ ends ; -- unsettled @-@ looking ; whose light , dusky @-@ glowing at best , now
flickers foul in the socket ; whom the National Assembly will by and by ,
to save time , &apos; regard as in a state of distraction . &apos; Note lastly that
globular Younger Mirabeau ; indignant that his elder Brother is among the
Commons : it is Viscomte Mirabeau ; named oftener Mirabeau Tonneau ( Barrel
Mirabeau ) , on account of his rotundity , and the quantities of strong
liquor he contains .

There then walks our French Noblesse . All in the old pomp of chivalry :
and yet , alas , how changed from the old position ; drifted far down from
their native latitude , like Arctic icebergs got into the Equatorial sea ,
and fast thawing there ! Once these Chivalry Duces ( Dukes , as they
are still named ) did actually lead the world , -- were it only towards
battle @-@ spoil , where lay the world &apos;s best wages then : moreover , being the
ablest Leaders going , they had their lion &apos;s share , those Duces ;
which none could grudge them . But now , when so many Looms , improved
Ploughshares , Steam @-@ Engines and Bills of Exchange have been invented ;
and , for battle @-@ brawling itself , men hire Drill @-@ Sergeants at
eighteen @-@ pence a @-@ day , -- what mean these goldmantled Chivalry Figures ,
walking there &apos; in black @-@ velvet cloaks , &apos; in high @-@ plumed &apos; hats of a feudal
cut &apos; ? Reeds shaken in the wind !

The Clergy have got up ; with Cahiers for abolishing pluralities ,
enforcing residence of bishops , better payment of tithes . ( Hist . Parl .
i . 322 @-@ 27 . ) The Dignitaries , we can observe , walk stately , apart from
the numerous Undignified , -- who indeed are properly little other than
Commons disguised in Curate @-@ frocks . Here , however , though by strange
ways , shall the Precept be fulfilled , and they that are greatest ( much
to their astonishment ) become least . For one example , out of many , mark
that plausible Gregoire : one day Cure Gregoire shall be a Bishop , when
the now stately are wandering distracted , as Bishops in partibus . With
other thought , mark also the Abbe Maury : his broad bold face ;
mouth accurately primmed ; full eyes , that ray out intelligence ,
falsehood , -- the sort of sophistry which is astonished you should find it
sophistical . Skilfulest vamper @-@ up of old rotten leather , to make it look
like new ; always a rising man ; he used to tell Mercier , &quot; You will see ;
I shall be in the Academy before you . &quot; ( Mercier , Nouveau Paris . ) Likely
indeed , thou skilfullest Maury ; nay thou shalt have a Cardinal &apos;s Hat ,
and plush and glory ; but alas , also , in the longrun -- mere oblivion , like
the rest of us ; and six feet of earth ! What boots it , vamping rotten
leather on these terms ? Glorious in comparison is the livelihood thy
good old Father earns , by making shoes , -- one may hope , in a sufficient
manner . Maury does not want for audacity . He shall wear pistols , by and
by ; and at death @-@ cries of &quot; The Lamp @-@ iron ; &quot; answer coolly , &quot; Friends , will
you see better there ? &quot;

But yonder , halting lamely along , thou noticest next Bishop
Talleyrand @-@ Perigord , his Reverence of Autun . A sardonic grimness lies
in that irreverent Reverence of Autun . He will do and suffer strange
things ; and will become surely one of the strangest things ever seen ,
or like to be seen . A man living in falsehood , and on falsehood ; yet
not what you can call a false man : there is the specialty ! It will be an
enigma for future ages , one may hope : hitherto such a product of Nature
and Art was possible only for this age of ours , -- Age of Paper , and of
the Burning of Paper . Consider Bishop Talleyrand and Marquis Lafayette
as the topmost of their two kinds ; and say once more , looking at what
they did and what they were , O Tempus ferax rerum !

On the whole , however , has not this unfortunate Clergy also drifted in
the Time @-@ stream , far from its native latitude ? An anomalous mass of
men ; of whom the whole world has already a dim understanding that it can
understand nothing . They were once a Priesthood , interpreters of Wisdom ,
revealers of the Holy that is in Man : a true Clerus ( or Inheritance of
God on Earth ) : but now ? -- They pass silently , with such Cahiers as they
have been able to redact ; and none cries , God bless them .

King Louis with his Court brings up the rear : he cheerful , in this day
of hope , is saluted with plaudits ; still more Necker his Minister .
Not so the Queen ; on whom hope shines not steadily any more . Ill @-@ fated
Queen ! Her hair is already gray with many cares and crosses ; her
first @-@ born son is dying in these weeks : black falsehood has ineffaceably
soiled her name ; ineffaceably while this generation lasts . Instead of
Vive la Reine , voices insult her with Vive d &apos;Orleans . Of her queenly
beauty little remains except its stateliness ; not now gracious , but
haughty , rigid , silently enduring . With a most mixed feeling , wherein
joy has no part , she resigns herself to a day she hoped never to have
seen . Poor Marie Antoinette ; with thy quick noble instincts ; vehement
glancings , vision all @-@ too fitful narrow for the work thou hast to do !
O there are tears in store for thee ; bitterest wailings , soft womanly
meltings , though thou hast the heart of an imperial Theresa &apos;s Daughter .
Thou doomed one , shut thy eyes on the future ! --

And so , in stately Procession , have passed the Elected of France . Some
towards honour and quick fire @-@ consummation ; most towards dishonour ; not
a few towards massacre , confusion , emigration , desperation : all
towards Eternity ! -- So many heterogeneities cast together into the
fermenting @-@ vat ; there , with incalculable action , counteraction , elective
affinities , explosive developments , to work out healing for a sick
moribund System of Society ! Probably the strangest Body of Men , if we
consider well , that ever met together on our Planet on such an errand .
So thousandfold complex a Society , ready to burst @-@ up from its infinite
depths ; and these men , its rulers and healers , without life @-@ rule for
themselves , -- other life @-@ rule than a Gospel according to Jean Jacques !
To the wisest of them , what we must call the wisest , man is properly an
Accident under the sky . Man is without Duty round him ; except it be &apos; to
make the Constitution . &apos; He is without Heaven above him , or Hell beneath
him ; he has no God in the world .

What further or better belief can be said to exist in these Twelve
Hundred ? Belief in high @-@ plumed hats of a feudal cut ; in heraldic
scutcheons ; in the divine right of Kings , in the divine right of
Game @-@ destroyers . Belief , or what is still worse , canting half @-@ belief ;
or worst of all , mere Macchiavellic pretence @-@ of @-@ belief , -- in consecrated
dough @-@ wafers , and the godhood of a poor old Italian Man ! Nevertheless
in that immeasurable Confusion and Corruption , which struggles there so
blindly to become less confused and corrupt , there is , as we said ,
this one salient point of a New Life discernible : the deep fixed
Determination to have done with Shams . A determination , which ,
consciously or unconsciously , is fixed ; which waxes ever more fixed ,
into very madness and fixed @-@ idea ; which in such embodiment as lies
provided there , shall now unfold itself rapidly : monstrous , stupendous ,
unspeakable ; new for long thousands of years ! -- How has the Heaven &apos;s
light , oftentimes in this Earth , to clothe itself in thunder and
electric murkiness ; and descend as molten lightning , blasting , if
purifying ! Nay is it not rather the very murkiness , and atmospheric
suffocation , that brings the lightning and the light ? The new Evangel ,
as the old had been , was it to be born in the Destruction of a World ?

But how the Deputies assisted at High Mass , and heard sermon , and
applauded the preacher , church as it was , when he preached politics ;
how , next day , with sustained pomp , they are , for the first time ,
installed in their Salles des Menus ( Hall no longer of Amusements ) , and
become a States @-@ General , -- readers can fancy for themselves . The King
from his estrade , gorgeous as Solomon in all his glory , runs his eye
over that majestic Hall ; many @-@ plumed , many @-@ glancing ; bright @-@ tinted
as rainbow , in the galleries and near side spaces , where Beauty sits
raining bright influence . Satisfaction , as of one that after long
voyaging had got to port , plays over his broad simple face : the innocent
King ! He rises and speaks , with sonorous tone , a conceivable speech .
With which , still more with the succeeding one @-@ hour and two @-@ hour
speeches of Garde @-@ des @-@ Sceaux and M. Necker , full of nothing but
patriotism , hope , faith , and deficiency of the revenue , -- no reader of
these pages shall be tried .

We remark only that , as his Majesty , on finishing the speech , put on
his plumed hat , and the Noblesse according to custom imitated him , our
Tiers @-@ Etat Deputies did mostly , not without a shade of fierceness , in
like manner clap @-@ on , and even crush on their slouched hats ; and stand
there awaiting the issue . ( Histoire Parlementaire ( i . 356 ) . Mercier ,
Nouveau Paris , &amp; c . ) Thick buzz among them , between majority and minority
of Couvrezvous , Decrouvrez @-@ vous ( Hats off , Hats on ) ! To which his
Majesty puts end , by taking off his own royal hat again .

The session terminates without further accident or omen than this ; with
which , significantly enough , France has opened her States @-@ General .



BOOK 1.V.

THE THIRD ESTATE


Chapter 1.5.I.

Inertia .

That exasperated France , in this same National Assembly of hers , has
got something , nay something great , momentous , indispensable , cannot be
doubted ; yet still the question were : Specially what ? A question hard
to solve , even for calm onlookers at this distance ; wholly insoluble to
actors in the middle of it . The States @-@ General , created and conflated by
the passionate effort of the whole nation , is there as a thing high and
lifted up . Hope , jubilating , cries aloud that it will prove a miraculous
Brazen Serpent in the Wilderness ; whereon whosoever looks , with faith
and obedience , shall be healed of all woes and serpent @-@ bites .

We may answer , it will at least prove a symbolic Banner ; round which the
exasperating complaining Twenty @-@ Five Millions , otherwise isolated and
without power , may rally , and work -- what it is in them to work . If
battle must be the work , as one cannot help expecting , then shall it
be a battle @-@ banner ( say , an Italian Gonfalon , in its old Republican
Carroccio ) ; and shall tower up , car @-@ borne , shining in the wind : and with
iron tongue peal forth many a signal . A thing of prime necessity ; which
whether in the van or in the centre , whether leading or led and driven ,
must do the fighting multitude incalculable services . For a season ,
while it floats in the very front , nay as it were stands solitary
there , waiting whether force will gather round it , this same National
Carroccio , and the signal @-@ peals it rings , are a main object with us .

The omen of the &apos; slouch @-@ hats clapt on &apos; shows the Commons Deputies to
have made up their minds on one thing : that neither Noblesse nor Clergy
shall have precedence of them ; hardly even Majesty itself . To such
length has the Contrat Social , and force of public opinion , carried
us . For what is Majesty but the Delegate of the Nation ; delegated , and
bargained with ( even rather tightly ) , -- in some very singular posture of
affairs , which Jean Jacques has not fixed the date of ?

Coming therefore into their Hall , on the morrow , an inorganic mass
of Six Hundred individuals , these Commons Deputies perceive , without
terror , that they have it all to themselves . Their Hall is also the
Grand or general Hall for all the Three Orders . But the Noblesse and
Clergy , it would seem , have retired to their two separate Apartments , or
Halls ; and are there &apos; verifying their powers , &apos; not in a conjoint but
in a separate capacity . They are to constitute two separate , perhaps
separately @-@ voting Orders , then ? It is as if both Noblesse and Clergy
had silently taken for granted that they already were such ! Two Orders
against one ; and so the Third Order to be left in a perpetual minority ?

Much may remain unfixed ; but the negative of that is a thing fixed :
in the Slouch @-@ hatted heads , in the French Nation &apos;s head . Double
representation , and all else hitherto gained , were otherwise futile ,
null . Doubtless , the &apos; powers must be verified ; &apos; -- doubtless , the
Commission , the electoral Documents of your Deputy must be inspected
by his brother Deputies , and found valid : it is the preliminary of all .
Neither is this question , of doing it separately or doing it conjointly ,
a vital one : but if it lead to such ? It must be resisted ; wise was that
maxim , Resist the beginnings ! Nay were resistance unadvisable , even
dangerous , yet surely pause is very natural : pause , with Twenty @-@ five
Millions behind you , may become resistance enough . -- The inorganic mass
of Commons Deputies will restrict itself to a &apos; system of inertia , &apos; and
for the present remain inorganic .

Such method , recommendable alike to sagacity and to timidity , do the
Commons Deputies adopt ; and , not without adroitness , and with ever more
tenacity , they persist in it , day after day , week after week . For
six weeks their history is of the kind named barren ; which indeed , as
Philosophy knows , is often the fruitfulest of all . These were their
still creation @-@ days ; wherein they sat incubating ! In fact , what they
did was to do nothing , in a judicious manner . Daily the inorganic body
reassembles ; regrets that they cannot get organisation , &apos; verification of
powers in common , and begin regenerating France . Headlong motions may be
made , but let such be repressed ; inertia alone is at once unpunishable
and unconquerable .

Cunning must be met by cunning ; proud pretension by inertia , by a low
tone of patriotic sorrow ; low , but incurable , unalterable . Wise as
serpents ; harmless as doves : what a spectacle for France ! Six Hundred
inorganic individuals , essential for its regeneration and salvation , sit
there , on their elliptic benches , longing passionately towards life ;
in painful durance ; like souls waiting to be born . Speeches are spoken ;
eloquent ; audible within doors and without . Mind agitates itself against
mind ; the Nation looks on with ever deeper interest . Thus do the Commons
Deputies sit incubating .

There are private conclaves , supper @-@ parties , consultations ; Breton Club ,
Club of Viroflay ; germs of many Clubs . Wholly an element of confused
noise , dimness , angry heat ; -- wherein , however , the Eros @-@ egg , kept at the
fit temperature , may hover safe , unbroken till it be hatched . In your
Mouniers , Malouets , Lechapeliers in science sufficient for that ; fervour
in your Barnaves , Rabauts . At times shall come an inspiration from royal
Mirabeau : he is nowise yet recognised as royal ; nay he was &apos; groaned
at , &apos; when his name was first mentioned : but he is struggling towards
recognition .

In the course of the week , the Commons having called their Eldest to
the chair , and furnished him with young stronger @-@ lunged assistants , -- can
speak articulately ; and , in audible lamentable words , declare , as
we said , that they are an inorganic body , longing to become organic .
Letters arrive ; but an inorganic body cannot open letters ; they lie on
the table unopened . The Eldest may at most procure for himself some kind
of List or Muster @-@ roll , to take the votes by , and wait what will betide .
Noblesse and Clergy are all elsewhere : however , an eager public crowds
all galleries and vacancies ; which is some comfort . With effort , it
is determined , not that a Deputation shall be sent , -- for how can an
inorganic body send deputations ? -- but that certain individual Commons
Members shall , in an accidental way , stroll into the Clergy Chamber ,
and then into the Noblesse one ; and mention there , as a thing they have
happened to observe , that the Commons seem to be sitting waiting for
them , in order to verify their powers . That is the wiser method !

The Clergy , among whom are such a multitude of Undignified , of mere
Commons in Curates &apos; frocks , depute instant respectful answer that they
are , and will now more than ever be , in deepest study as to that very
matter . Contrariwise the Noblesse , in cavalier attitude , reply , after
four days , that they , for their part , are all verified and constituted ;
which , they had trusted , the Commons also were ; such separate
verification being clearly the proper constitutional wisdom @-@ of @-@ ancestors
method ; -- as they the Noblesse will have much pleasure in demonstrating
by a Commission of their number , if the Commons will meet them ,
Commission against Commission ! Directly in the rear of which comes a
deputation of Clergy , reiterating , in their insidious conciliatory way ,
the same proposal . Here , then , is a complexity : what will wise Commons
say to this ?

Warily , inertly , the wise Commons , considering that they are , if not a
French Third Estate , at least an Aggregate of individuals pretending to
some title of that kind , determine , after talking on it five days , to
name such a Commission , -- though , as it were , with proviso not to be
convinced : a sixth day is taken up in naming it ; a seventh and an eighth
day in getting the forms of meeting , place , hour and the like , settled :
so that it is not till the evening of the 23rd of May that Noblesse
Commission first meets Commons Commission , Clergy acting as
Conciliators ; and begins the impossible task of convincing it . One other
meeting , on the 25th , will suffice : the Commons are inconvincible , the
Noblesse and Clergy irrefragably convincing ; the Commissions retire ;
each Order persisting in its first pretensions . ( Reported Debates , 6th
May to 1st June , 1789 in Histoire Parlementaire , i . 379 @-@ 422 . )

Thus have three weeks passed . For three weeks , the Third @-@ Estate
Carroccio , with far @-@ seen Gonfalon , has stood stockstill , flouting the
wind ; waiting what force would gather round it .

Fancy can conceive the feeling of the Court ; and how counsel met
counsel , the loud @-@ sounding inanity whirled in that distracted vortex ,
where wisdom could not dwell . Your cunningly devised Taxing @-@ Machine has
been got together ; set up with incredible labour ; and stands there , its
three pieces in contact ; its two fly @-@ wheels of Noblesse and Clergy ,
its huge working @-@ wheel of Tiers @-@ Etat . The two fly @-@ wheels whirl in the
softest manner ; but , prodigious to look upon , the huge working @-@ wheel
hangs motionless , refuses to stir ! The cunningest engineers are at
fault . How will it work , when it does begin ? Fearfully , my Friends ;
and to many purposes ; but to gather taxes , or grind court @-@ meal , one may
apprehend , never . Could we but have continued gathering taxes by hand !
Messeigneurs d &apos;Artois , Conti , Conde ( named Court Triumvirate ) , they
of the anti @-@ democratic Memoire au Roi , has not their foreboding proved
true ? They may wave reproachfully their high heads ; they may beat
their poor brains ; but the cunningest engineers can do nothing . Necker
himself , were he even listened to , begins to look blue . The only thing
one sees advisable is to bring up soldiers . New regiments , two , and a
battalion of a third , have already reached Paris ; others shall get in
march . Good were it , in all circumstances , to have troops within reach ;
good that the command were in sure hands . Let Broglie be appointed ;
old Marshal Duke de Broglie ; veteran disciplinarian , of a firm
drill @-@ sergeant morality , such as may be depended on .

For , alas , neither are the Clergy , or the very Noblesse what they
should be ; and might be , when so menaced from without : entire ,
undivided within . The Noblesse , indeed , have their Catiline or Crispin
D &apos;Espremenil , dusky @-@ glowing , all in renegade heat ; their boisterous
Barrel @-@ Mirabeau ; but also they have their Lafayettes , Liancourts ,
Lameths ; above all , their D &apos;Orleans , now cut forever from his
Court @-@ moorings , and musing drowsily of high and highest sea @-@ prizes
( for is not he too a son of Henri Quatre , and partial potential
Heir @-@ Apparent ? ) -- on his voyage towards Chaos . From the Clergy again ,
so numerous are the Cures , actual deserters have run over : two small
parties ; in the second party Cure Gregoire . Nay there is talk of a
whole Hundred and Forty @-@ nine of them about to desert in mass , and only
restrained by an Archbishop of Paris . It seems a losing game .

But judge if France , if Paris sat idle , all this while ! Addresses from
far and near flow in : for our Commons have now grown organic enough to
open letters . Or indeed to cavil at them ! Thus poor Marquis de Breze ,
Supreme Usher , Master of Ceremonies , or whatever his title was , writing
about this time on some ceremonial matter , sees no harm in winding up
with a &apos; Monsieur , yours with sincere attachment . &apos; -- &quot; To whom does it
address itself , this sincere attachment ? &quot; inquires Mirabeau . &quot; To the
Dean of the Tiers @-@ Etat . &quot; -- &quot; There is no man in France entitled to write
that , &quot; rejoins he ; whereat the Galleries and the World will not be kept
from applauding . ( Moniteur ( in Histoire Parlementaire , i . 405 ) . ) Poor
De Breze ! These Commons have a still older grudge at him ; nor has he yet
done with them .

In another way , Mirabeau has had to protest against the quick
suppression of his Newspaper , Journal of the States @-@ General ; -- and
to continue it under a new name . In which act of valour , the Paris
Electors , still busy redacting their Cahier , could not but support him ,
by Address to his Majesty : they claim utmost &apos; provisory freedom of
the press ; &apos; they have spoken even about demolishing the Bastille ,
and erecting a Bronze Patriot King on the site ! -- These are the rich
Burghers : but now consider how it went , for example , with such loose
miscellany , now all grown eleutheromaniac , of Loungers , Prowlers , social
Nondescripts ( and the distilled Rascality of our Planet ) , as whirls
forever in the Palais Royal ; -- or what low infinite groan , first
changing into a growl , comes from Saint @-@ Antoine , and the Twenty @-@ five
Millions in danger of starvation !

There is the indisputablest scarcity of corn ; -- be it Aristocrat @-@ plot ,
D &apos;Orleans @-@ plot , of this year ; or drought and hail of last year : in city
and province , the poor man looks desolately towards a nameless lot . And
this States @-@ General , that could make us an age of gold , is forced
to stand motionless ; cannot get its powers verified ! All industry
necessarily languishes , if it be not that of making motions .

In the Palais Royal there has been erected , apparently by subscription ,
a kind of Wooden Tent ( en planches de bois ) ; ( Histoire Parlementaire ,
i . 429 . ) -- most convenient ; where select Patriotism can now redact
resolutions , deliver harangues , with comfort , let the weather but as it
will . Lively is that Satan @-@ at @-@ Home ! On his table , on his chair , in
every cafe , stands a patriotic orator ; a crowd round him within ; a crowd
listening from without , open @-@ mouthed , through open door and window ;
with &apos; thunders of applause for every sentiment of more than common
hardiness . &apos; In Monsieur Dessein &apos;s Pamphlet @-@ shop , close by , you cannot
without strong elbowing get to the counter : every hour produces its
pamphlet , or litter of pamphlets ; &apos; there were thirteen to @-@ day , sixteen
yesterday , nine @-@ two last week . &apos; ( Arthur Young , Travels , i . 104 . ) Think
of Tyranny and Scarcity ; Fervid @-@ eloquence , Rumour , Pamphleteering ;
Societe Publicole , Breton Club , Enraged Club ; -- and whether every
tap @-@ room , coffee @-@ room , social reunion , accidental street @-@ group , over
wide France , was not an Enraged Club !

To all which the Commons Deputies can only listen with a sublime inertia
of sorrow ; reduced to busy themselves &apos; with their internal police . &apos; 
Surer position no Deputies ever occupied ; if they keep it with skill .
Let not the temperature rise too high ; break not the Eros @-@ egg till it be
hatched , till it break itself ! An eager public crowds all Galleries and
vacancies ! &apos; cannot be restrained from applauding . &apos; The two Privileged
Orders , the Noblesse all verified and constituted , may look on with what
face they will ; not without a secret tremor of heart . The Clergy , always
acting the part of conciliators , make a clutch at the Galleries , and the
popularity there ; and miss it . Deputation of them arrives , with dolorous
message about the &apos; dearth of grains , &apos; and the necessity there is of
casting aside vain formalities , and deliberating on this . An insidious
proposal ; which , however , the Commons ( moved thereto by seagreen
Robespierre ) dexterously accept as a sort of hint , or even pledge ,
that the Clergy will forthwith come over to them , constitute
the States @-@ General , and so cheapen grains ! ( Bailly , Memoires , i .
114 . ) -- Finally , on the 27th day of May , Mirabeau , judging the time
now nearly come , proposes that &apos; the inertia cease ; &apos; that , leaving the
Noblesse to their own stiff ways , the Clergy be summoned , &apos; in the
name of the God of Peace , &apos; to join the Commons , and begin . ( Histoire
Parlementaire , i . 413 . ) To which summons if they turn a deaf ear , -- we
shall see ! Are not one Hundred and Forty @-@ nine of them ready to desert ?

O Triumvirate of Princes , new Garde @-@ des @-@ Sceaux Barentin , thou
Home @-@ Secretary Breteuil , Duchess Polignac , and Queen eager to
listen , -- what is now to be done ? This Third Estate will get in
motion , with the force of all France in it ; Clergy @-@ machinery with
Noblesse @-@ machinery , which were to serve as beautiful counter @-@ balances
and drags , will be shamefully dragged after it , -- and take fire along
with it . What is to be done ? The Oeil @-@ de @-@ Boeuf waxes more confused than
ever . Whisper and counter @-@ whisper ; a very tempest of whispers ! Leading
men from all the Three Orders are nightly spirited thither ; conjurors
many of them ; but can they conjure this ? Necker himself were now
welcome , could he interfere to purpose .

Let Necker interfere , then ; and in the King &apos;s name ! Happily that
incendiary &apos; God @-@ of @-@ Peace &apos; message is not yet answered . The Three Orders
shall again have conferences ; under this Patriot Minister of theirs ,
somewhat may be healed , clouted up ; -- we meanwhile getting forward Swiss
Regiments , and a &apos; hundred pieces of field @-@ artillery . &apos; This is what the
Oeil @-@ de @-@ Boeuf , for its part , resolves on .

But as for Necker -- Alas , poor Necker , thy obstinate Third Estate has
one first @-@ last word , verification in common , as the pledge of voting and
deliberating in common ! Half @-@ way proposals , from such a tried friend ,
they answer with a stare . The tardy conferences speedily break up ;
the Third Estate , now ready and resolute , the whole world backing
it , returns to its Hall of the Three Orders ; and Necker to the
Oeil @-@ de @-@ Boeuf , with the character of a disconjured conjuror there -- fit
only for dismissal . ( Debates , 1st to 17th June 1789 ( in Histoire
Parlementaire , i . 422 @-@ 478 ) . )

And so the Commons Deputies are at last on their own strength getting
under way ? Instead of Chairman , or Dean , they have now got a President :
Astronomer Bailly . Under way , with a vengeance ! With endless vociferous
and temperate eloquence , borne on Newspaper wings to all lands , they
have now , on this 17th day of June , determined that their name is
not Third Estate , but -- National Assembly ! They , then , are the Nation ?
Triumvirate of Princes , Queen , refractory Noblesse and Clergy , what ,
then , are you ? A most deep question ; -- scarcely answerable in living
political dialects .

All regardless of which , our new National Assembly proceeds to appoint
a &apos; committee of subsistences ; &apos; dear to France , though it can find little
or no grain . Next , as if our National Assembly stood quite firm on its
legs , -- to appoint &apos; four other standing committees ; &apos; then to settle the
security of the National Debt ; then that of the Annual Taxation : all
within eight @-@ and @-@ forty hours . At such rate of velocity it is going : the
conjurors of the Oeil @-@ de @-@ Boeuf may well ask themselves , Whither ?



Chapter 1.5.II.

Mercury de Breze .

Now surely were the time for a &apos; god from the machine ; &apos; there is a nodus
worthy of one . The only question is , Which god ? Shall it be Mars de
Broglie , with his hundred pieces of cannon ? -- Not yet , answers prudence ;
so soft , irresolute is King Louis . Let it be Messenger Mercury , our
Supreme Usher de Breze .

On the morrow , which is the 20th of June , these Hundred and Forty @-@ nine
false Curates , no longer restrainable by his Grace of Paris , will desert
in a body : let De Breze intervene , and produce -- closed doors ! Not only
shall there be Royal Session , in that Salle des Menus ; but no meeting ,
nor working ( except by carpenters ) , till then . Your Third Estate ,
self @-@ styled &apos; National Assembly , &apos; shall suddenly see itself extruded
from its Hall , by carpenters , in this dexterous way ; and reduced to do
nothing , not even to meet , or articulately lament , -- till Majesty , with
Seance Royale and new miracles , be ready ! In this manner shall De Breze ,
as Mercury ex machina , intervene ; and , if the Oeil @-@ de @-@ Boeuf mistake not ,
work deliverance from the nodus .

Of poor De Breze we can remark that he has yet prospered in none of his
dealings with these Commons . Five weeks ago , when they kissed the hand
of Majesty , the mode he took got nothing but censure ; and then his
&apos;sincere attachment , &apos; how was it scornfully whiffed aside ! Before
supper , this night , he writes to President Bailly , a new Letter , to be
delivered shortly after dawn tomorrow , in the King &apos;s name . Which Letter ,
however , Bailly in the pride of office , will merely crush together into
his pocket , like a bill he does not mean to pay .

Accordingly on Saturday morning the 20th of June , shrill @-@ sounding
heralds proclaim through the streets of Versailles , that there is to be
a Seance Royale next Monday ; and no meeting of the States @-@ General till
then . And yet , we observe , President Bailly in sound of this , and with
De Breze &apos;s Letter in his pocket , is proceeding , with National Assembly
at his heels , to the accustomed Salles des Menus ; as if De Breze and
heralds were mere wind . It is shut , this Salle ; occupied by Gardes
Francaises . &quot; Where is your Captain ? &quot; The Captain shows his royal order :
workmen , he is grieved to say , are all busy setting up the platform for
his Majesty &apos;s Seance ; most unfortunately , no admission ; admission , at
furthest , for President and Secretaries to bring away papers , which the
joiners might destroy ! -- President Bailly enters with Secretaries ;
and returns bearing papers : alas , within doors , instead of patriotic
eloquence , there is now no noise but hammering , sawing , and operative
screeching and rumbling ! A profanation without parallel .

The Deputies stand grouped on the Paris Road , on this umbrageous Avenue
de Versailles ; complaining aloud of the indignity done them . Courtiers ,
it is supposed , look from their windows , and giggle . The morning is
none of the comfortablest : raw ; it is even drizzling a little . ( Bailly ,
Memoires , i . 185 @-@ 206 . ) But all travellers pause ; patriot gallery @-@ men ,
miscellaneous spectators increase the groups . Wild counsels alternate .
Some desperate Deputies propose to go and hold session on the great
outer Staircase at Marly , under the King &apos;s windows ; for his Majesty ,
it seems , has driven over thither . Others talk of making the Chateau
Forecourt , what they call Place d &apos;Armes , a Runnymede and new Champ
de Mai of free Frenchmen : nay of awakening , to sounds of indignant
Patriotism , the echoes of the Oeil @-@ de @-@ boeuf itself . -- Notice is given
that President Bailly , aided by judicious Guillotin and others , has
found place in the Tennis @-@ Court of the Rue St. Francois . Thither , in
long @-@ drawn files , hoarse @-@ jingling , like cranes on wing , the Commons
Deputies angrily wend .

Strange sight was this in the Rue St. Francois , Vieux Versailles ! A
naked Tennis @-@ Court , as the pictures of that time still give it : four
walls ; naked , except aloft some poor wooden penthouse , or roofed
spectators &apos; -gallery , hanging round them : -- on the floor not now an idle
teeheeing , a snapping of balls and rackets ; but the bellowing din of an
indignant National Representation , scandalously exiled hither ! However ,
a cloud of witnesses looks down on them , from wooden penthouse , from
wall @-@ top , from adjoining roof and chimney ; rolls towards them from all
quarters , with passionate spoken blessings . Some table can be procured
to write on ; some chair , if not to sit on , then to stand on . The
Secretaries undo their tapes ; Bailly has constituted the Assembly .

Experienced Mounier , not wholly new to such things , in Parlementary
revolts , which he has seen or heard of , thinks that it were well , in
these lamentable threatening circumstances , to unite themselves by an
Oath . -- Universal acclamation , as from smouldering bosoms getting vent !
The Oath is redacted ; pronounced aloud by President Bailly , -- and indeed
in such a sonorous tone , that the cloud of witnesses , even outdoors ,
hear it , and bellow response to it . Six hundred right @-@ hands rise with
President Bailly &apos;s , to take God above to witness that they will
not separate for man below , but will meet in all places , under all
circumstances , wheresoever two or three can get together , till they have
made the Constitution . Made the Constitution , Friends ! That is a long
task . Six hundred hands , meanwhile , will sign as they have sworn :
six hundred save one ; one Loyalist Abdiel , still visible by this sole
light @-@ point , and nameable , poor &apos; M. Martin d &apos;Auch , from Castelnaudary ,
in Languedoc . &apos; Him they permit to sign or signify refusal ; they even
save him from the cloud of witnesses , by declaring &apos; his head deranged . &apos; 
At four o &apos;clock , the signatures are all appended ; new meeting is fixed
for Monday morning , earlier than the hour of the Royal Session ; that our
Hundred and Forty @-@ nine Clerical deserters be not balked : we shall meet
&apos;at the Recollets Church or elsewhere , &apos; in hope that our Hundred and
Forty @-@ nine will join us ; -- and now it is time to go to dinner .

This , then , is the Session of the Tennis @-@ Court , famed Seance du Jeu de
Paume ; the fame of which has gone forth to all lands . This is Mercurius
de Breze &apos;s appearance as Deus ex machina ; this is the fruit it brings !
The giggle of Courtiers in the Versailles Avenue has already died
into gaunt silence . Did the distracted Court , with Gardes @-@ des @-@ Sceaux
Barentin , Triumvirate and Company , imagine that they could scatter six
hundred National Deputies , big with a National Constitution , like as
much barndoor poultry , big with next to nothing , -- by the white or black
rod of a Supreme Usher ? Barndoor poultry fly cackling : but National
Deputies turn round , lion @-@ faced ; and , with uplifted right @-@ hand , swear an
Oath that makes the four corners of France tremble .

President Bailly has covered himself with honour ; which shall become
rewards . The National Assembly is now doubly and trebly the Nation &apos;s
Assembly ; not militant , martyred only , but triumphant ; insulted , and
which could not be insulted . Paris disembogues itself once more ,
to witness , &apos; with grim looks , &apos; the Seance Royale : ( See Arthur Young
( Travels , i . 115 @-@ 118 ) ; A. Lameth , &amp; c . ) which , by a new felicity ,
is postponed till Tuesday . The Hundred and Forty @-@ nine , and even with
Bishops among them , all in processional mass , have had free leisure
to march off , and solemnly join the Commons sitting waiting in their
Church . The Commons welcomed them with shouts , with embracings , nay
with tears ; ( Dumont , Souvenirs sur Mirabeau , c . 4 . ) for it is growing a
life @-@ and @-@ death matter now .

As for the Seance itself , the Carpenters seem to have accomplished their
platform ; but all else remains unaccomplished . Futile , we may say fatal ,
was the whole matter . King Louis enters , through seas of people , all
grim @-@ silent , angry with many things , -- for it is a bitter rain too .
Enters , to a Third Estate , likewise grim @-@ silent ; which has been wetted
waiting under mean porches , at back @-@ doors , while Court and Privileged
were entering by the front . King and Garde @-@ des @-@ Sceaux ( there is
no Necker visible ) make known , not without longwindedness , the
determinations of the royal breast . The Three Orders shall vote
separately . On the other hand , France may look for considerable
constitutional blessings ; as specified in these Five @-@ and @-@ thirty
Articles , ( Histoire Parlementaire , i . 13 . ) which Garde @-@ des @-@ Sceaux is
waxing hoarse with reading . Which Five @-@ and @-@ Thirty Articles , adds his
Majesty again rising , if the Three Orders most unfortunately cannot
agree together to effect them , I myself will effect : &quot; seul je ferai
le bien de mes peuples , &quot; -- which being interpreted may signify , You ,
contentious Deputies of the States @-@ General , have probably not long to be
here ! But , in fine , all shall now withdraw for this day ; and meet again ,
each Order in its separate place , to @-@ morrow morning , for despatch of
business . This is the determination of the royal breast : pithy and
clear . And herewith King , retinue , Noblesse , majority of Clergy file
out , as if the whole matter were satisfactorily completed .

These file out ; through grim @-@ silent seas of people . Only the Commons
Deputies file not out ; but stand there in gloomy silence , uncertain what
they shall do . One man of them is certain ; one man of them discerns and
dares ! It is now that King Mirabeau starts to the Tribune , and lifts up
his lion @-@ voice . Verily a word in season ; for , in such scenes , the moment
is the mother of ages ! Had not Gabriel Honore been there , -- one can well
fancy , how the Commons Deputies , affrighted at the perils which now
yawned dim all round them , and waxing ever paler in each other &apos;s
paleness , might very naturally , one after one , have glided off ; and the
whole course of European History have been different !

But he is there . List to the brool of that royal forest @-@ voice ;
sorrowful , low ; fast swelling to a roar ! Eyes kindle at the glance of
his eye : -- National Deputies were missioned by a Nation ; they have
sworn an Oath ; they -- but lo ! while the lion &apos;s voice roars loudest ,
what Apparition is this ? Apparition of Mercurius de Breze , muttering
somewhat ! -- &quot; Speak out , &quot; cry several . -- &quot; Messieurs , &quot; shrills De Breze ,
repeating himself , &quot; You have heard the King &apos;s orders ! &quot; -- Mirabeau glares
on him with fire @-@ flashing face ; shakes the black lion &apos;s mane : &quot; Yes ,
Monsieur , we have heard what the King was advised to say : and you who
cannot be the interpreter of his orders to the States @-@ General ; you ,
who have neither place nor right of speech here ; you are not the man to
remind us of it . Go , Monsieur , tell these who sent you that we are here
by the will of the People , and that nothing shall send us hence but the
force of bayonets ! &quot; ( Moniteur ( Hist . Parl. ii . 22 . ) . ) And poor De Breze
shivers forth from the National Assembly ; -- and also ( if it be not in one
faintest glimmer , months later ) finally from the page of History ! --

Hapless De Breze ; doomed to survive long ages , in men &apos;s memory , in this
faint way , with tremulent white rod ! He was true to Etiquette , which
was his Faith here below ; a martyr to respect of persons . Short woollen
cloaks could not kiss Majesty &apos;s hand as long velvet ones did . Nay
lately , when the poor little Dauphin lay dead , and some ceremonial
Visitation came , was he not punctual to announce it even to the
Dauphin &apos;s dead body : &quot; Monseigneur , a Deputation of the States @-@ General ! &quot;
( Montgaillard , ii . 38 . ) Sunt lachrymae rerum .

But what does the Oeil @-@ de @-@ Boeuf , now when De Breze shivers back thither ?
Despatch that same force of bayonets ? Not so : the seas of people still
hang multitudinous , intent on what is passing ; nay rush and roll ,
loud @-@ billowing , into the Courts of the Chateau itself ; for a report
has risen that Necker is to be dismissed . Worst of all , the Gardes
Francaises seem indisposed to act : &apos; two Companies of them do not fire
when ordered ! &apos; ( Histoire Parlementaire , ii . 26 . ) Necker , for not being
at the Seance , shall be shouted for , carried home in triumph ; and must
not be dismissed . His Grace of Paris , on the other hand , has to fly
with broken coach @-@ panels , and owe his life to furious driving . The
Gardes @-@ du @-@ Corps ( Body @-@ Guards ) , which you were drawing out , had better be
drawn in again . ( Bailly , i . 217 . ) There is no sending of bayonets to be
thought of .

Instead of soldiers , the Oeil @-@ de @-@ Boeuf sends -- carpenters , to take down
the platform . Ineffectual shift ! In few instants , the very carpenters
cease wrenching and knocking at their platform ; stand on it , hammer in
hand , and listen open @-@ mouthed . ( Histoire Parlementaire , ii . 23 . ) The
Third Estate is decreeing that it is , was , and will be , nothing but a
National Assembly ; and now , moreover , an inviolable one , all members of
it inviolable : &apos; infamous , traitorous , towards the Nation , and guilty
of capital crime , is any person , body @-@ corporate , tribunal , court or
commission that now or henceforth , during the present session or after
it , shall dare to pursue , interrogate , arrest , or cause to be arrested ,
detain or cause to be detained , any , &apos; &amp; c . &amp; c . &apos; on whose part soever the
same be commanded . &apos; ( Montgaillard , ii . 47 . ) Which done , one can wind up
with this comfortable reflection from Abbe Sieyes : &quot; Messieurs , you are
today what you were yesterday . &quot;

Courtiers may shriek ; but it is , and remains , even so . Their
well @-@ charged explosion has exploded through the touch @-@ hole ; covering
themselves with scorches , confusion , and unseemly soot ! Poor
Triumvirate , poor Queen ; and above all , poor Queen &apos;s Husband , who means
well , had he any fixed meaning ! Folly is that wisdom which is wise only
behindhand . Few months ago these Thirty @-@ five Concessions had filled
France with a rejoicing , which might have lasted for several years . Now
it is unavailing , the very mention of it slighted ; Majesty &apos;s express
orders set at nought .

All France is in a roar ; a sea of persons , estimated at &apos; ten thousand , &apos;
whirls &apos; all this day in the Palais Royal . &apos; ( Arthur Young , i . 119 . ) The
remaining Clergy , and likewise some Forty @-@ eight Noblesse , D &apos;Orleans
among them , have now forthwith gone over to the victorious Commons ; by
whom , as is natural , they are received &apos; with acclamation . &apos; 

The Third Estate triumphs ; Versailles Town shouting round it ; ten
thousand whirling all day in the Palais Royal ; and all France standing
a @-@ tiptoe , not unlike whirling ! Let the Oeil @-@ de @-@ Boeuf look to it . As for
King Louis , he will swallow his injuries ; will temporise , keep silence ;
will at all costs have present peace . It was Tuesday the 23d of June ,
when he spoke that peremptory royal mandate ; and the week is not done
till he has written to the remaining obstinate Noblesse , that they
also must oblige him , and give in . D &apos;Espremenil rages his last ; Barrel
Mirabeau &apos; breaks his sword , &apos; making a vow , -- which he might as well have
kept . The &apos; Triple Family &apos; is now therefore complete ; the third erring
brother , the Noblesse , having joined it ; -- erring but pardonable ;
soothed , so far as possible , by sweet eloquence from President Bailly .

So triumphs the Third Estate ; and States @-@ General are become National
Assembly ; and all France may sing Te Deum . By wise inertia , and wise
cessation of inertia , great victory has been gained . It is the last
night of June : all night you meet nothing on the streets of Versailles
but &apos; men running with torches &apos; with shouts of jubilation . From the 2nd
of May when they kissed the hand of Majesty , to this 30th of June when
men run with torches , we count seven weeks complete . For seven weeks the
National Carroccio has stood far @-@ seen , ringing many a signal ; and , so
much having now gathered round it , may hope to stand .



Chapter 1.5.III.

Broglie the War @-@ God .

The Court feels indignant that it is conquered ; but what then ? Another
time it will do better . Mercury descended in vain ; now has the time
come for Mars . -- The gods of the Oeil @-@ de @-@ Boeuf have withdrawn into the
darkness of their cloudy Ida ; and sit there , shaping and forging what
may be needful , be it &apos; billets of a new National Bank , &apos; munitions of
war , or things forever inscrutable to men .

Accordingly , what means this &apos; apparatus of troops &apos; ? The National
Assembly can get no furtherance for its Committee of Subsistences ; can
hear only that , at Paris , the Bakers &apos; shops are besieged ; that , in the
Provinces , people are living on &apos; meal @-@ husks and boiled grass . &apos; But on
all highways there hover dust @-@ clouds , with the march of regiments ,
with the trailing of cannon : foreign Pandours , of fierce aspect ;
Salis @-@ Samade , Esterhazy , Royal @-@ Allemand ; so many of them foreign , to
the number of thirty thousand , -- which fear can magnify to fifty :
all wending towards Paris and Versailles ! Already , on the heights of
Montmartre , is a digging and delving ; too like a scarping and trenching .
The effluence of Paris is arrested Versailles @-@ ward by a barrier of
cannon at Sevres Bridge . From the Queen &apos;s Mews , cannon stand pointed on
the National Assembly Hall itself . The National Assembly has its
very slumbers broken by the tramp of soldiery , swarming and defiling ,
endless , or seemingly endless , all round those spaces , at dead of night ,
&apos;without drum @-@ music , without audible word of command . &apos; ( A. Lameth ,
Assemblee Constituante , i . 41 . ) What means it ?

Shall eight , or even shall twelve Deputies , our Mirabeaus , Barnaves at
the head of them , be whirled suddenly to the Castle of Ham ; the rest
ignominiously dispersed to the winds ? No National Assembly can make
the Constitution with cannon levelled on it from the Queen &apos;s Mews !
What means this reticence of the Oeil @-@ de @-@ Boeuf , broken only by nods and
shrugs ? In the mystery of that cloudy Ida , what is it that they forge
and shape ? -- Such questions must distracted Patriotism keep asking , and
receive no answer but an echo .

Enough of themselves ! But now , above all , while the hungry food @-@ year ,
which runs from August to August , is getting older ; becoming more and
more a famine @-@ year ? With &apos; meal @-@ husks and boiled grass , &apos; Brigands may
actually collect ; and , in crowds , at farm and mansion , howl angrily ,
Food ! Food ! It is in vain to send soldiers against them : at sight of
soldiers they disperse , they vanish as under ground ; then directly
reassemble elsewhere for new tumult and plunder . Frightful enough
to look upon ; but what to hear of , reverberated through Twenty @-@ five
Millions of suspicious minds ! Brigands and Broglie , open Conflagration ,
preternatural Rumour are driving mad most hearts in France . What will
the issue of these things be ?

At Marseilles , many weeks ago , the Townsmen have taken arms ; for
&apos;suppressing of Brigands , &apos; and other purposes : the military commandant
may make of it what he will . Elsewhere , everywhere , could not the like
be done ? Dubious , on the distracted Patriot imagination , wavers , as a
last deliverance , some foreshadow of a National Guard . But conceive ,
above all , the Wooden Tent in the Palais Royal ! A universal hubbub
there , as of dissolving worlds : their loudest bellows the mad ,
mad @-@ making voice of Rumour ; their sharpest gazes Suspicion into the
pale dim World @-@ Whirlpool ; discerning shapes and phantasms ; imminent
bloodthirsty Regiments camped on the Champ @-@ de @-@ Mars ; dispersed National
Assembly ; redhot cannon @-@ balls ( to burn Paris ) ; -- the mad War @-@ god and
Bellona &apos;s sounding thongs . To the calmest man it is becoming too plain
that battle is inevitable .

Inevitable , silently nod Messeigneurs and Broglie : Inevitable and brief !
Your National Assembly , stopped short in its Constitutional labours , may
fatigue the royal ear with addresses and remonstrances : those cannon of
ours stand duly levelled ; those troops are here . The King &apos;s Declaration ,
with its Thirty @-@ five too generous Articles , was spoken , was not listened
to ; but remains yet unrevoked : he himself shall effect it , seul il fera !

As for Broglie , he has his headquarters at Versailles , all as in a
seat of war : clerks writing ; significant staff @-@ officers , inclined to
taciturnity ; plumed aides @-@ de @-@ camp , scouts , orderlies flying or hovering .
He himself looks forth , important , impenetrable ; listens to Besenval
Commandant of Paris , and his warning and earnest counsels ( for he has
come out repeatedly on purpose ) , with a silent smile . ( Besenval , iii .
398 . ) The Parisians resist ? scornfully cry Messeigneurs . As a meal @-@ mob
may ! They have sat quiet , these five generations , submitting to all .
Their Mercier declared , in these very years , that a Parisian revolt was
henceforth &apos; impossible . &apos; ( Mercier , Tableau de Paris , vi . 22 . ) Stand
by the royal Declaration , of the Twenty @-@ third of June . The Nobles of
France , valorous , chivalrous as of old , will rally round us with one
heart ; -- and as for this which you call Third Estate , and which we call
canaille of unwashed Sansculottes , of Patelins , Scribblers , factious
Spouters , -- brave Broglie , &apos; with a whiff of grapeshot ( salve de canons ) ,
if need be , will give quick account of it . Thus reason they : on their
cloudy Ida ; hidden from men , -- men also hidden from them .

Good is grapeshot , Messeigneurs , on one condition : that the shooter also
were made of metal ! But unfortunately he is made of flesh ; under his
buffs and bandoleers your hired shooter has instincts , feelings , even a
kind of thought . It is his kindred , bone of his bone , this same
canaille that shall be whiffed ; he has brothers in it , a father and
mother , -- living on meal @-@ husks and boiled grass . His very doxy , not yet
&apos;dead i &apos; the spital , &apos; drives him into military heterodoxy ; declares that
if he shed Patriot blood , he shall be accursed among men . The soldier ,
who has seen his pay stolen by rapacious Foulons , his blood wasted by
Soubises , Pompadours , and the gates of promotion shut inexorably on him
if he were not born noble , -- is himself not without griefs against you .
Your cause is not the soldier &apos;s cause ; but , as would seem , your own
only , and no other god &apos;s nor man &apos;s .

For example , the world may have heard how , at Bethune lately , when there
rose some &apos; riot about grains , &apos; of which sort there are so many , and the
soldiers stood drawn out , and the word &apos; Fire ! was given , -- not a trigger
stirred ; only the butts of all muskets rattled angrily against the
ground ; and the soldiers stood glooming , with a mixed expression
of countenance ; -- till clutched &apos; each under the arm of a patriot
householder , &apos; they were all hurried off , in this manner , to be treated
and caressed , and have their pay increased by subscription ! ( Histoire
Parlementaire . )

Neither have the Gardes Francaises , the best regiment of the line , shown
any promptitude for street @-@ firing lately . They returned grumbling from
Reveillon &apos;s ; and have not burnt a single cartridge since ; nay , as we
saw , not even when bid . A dangerous humour dwells in these Gardes .
Notable men too , in their way ! Valadi the Pythagorean was , at one time ,
an officer of theirs . Nay , in the ranks , under the three @-@ cornered felt
and cockade , what hard heads may there not be , and reflections going
on , -- unknown to the public ! One head of the hardest we do now discern
there : on the shoulders of a certain Sergeant Hoche . Lazare Hoche , that
is the name of him ; he used to be about the Versailles Royal Stables ,
nephew of a poor herbwoman ; a handy lad ; exceedingly addicted to
reading . He is now Sergeant Hoche , and can rise no farther : he lays out
his pay in rushlights , and cheap editions of books . ( Dictionnaire des
Hommes Marquans , Londres ( Paris ) , 1800 , ii . 198 . )

On the whole , the best seems to be : Consign these Gardes Francaises
to their Barracks . So Besenval thinks , and orders . Consigned to their
barracks , the Gardes Francaises do but form a &apos; Secret Association , &apos; an
Engagement not to act against the National Assembly . Debauched by
Valadi the Pythagorean ; debauched by money and women ! cry Besenval
and innumerable others . Debauched by what you will , or in need of no
debauching , behold them , long files of them , their consignment broken ,
arrive , headed by their Sergeants , on the 26th day of June , at the
Palais Royal ! Welcomed with vivats , with presents , and a pledge of
patriot liquor ; embracing and embraced ; declaring in words that the
cause of France is their cause ! Next day and the following days the
like . What is singular too , except this patriot humour , and breaking
of their consignment , they behave otherwise with &apos; the most rigorous
accuracy . &apos; ( Besenval , iii . 394 @-@ 6 . )

They are growing questionable , these Gardes ! Eleven ring @-@ leaders of them
are put in the Abbaye Prison . It boots not in the least . The imprisoned
Eleven have only , &apos; by the hand of an individual , &apos; to drop , towards
nightfall , a line in the Cafe de Foy ; where Patriotism harangues loudest
on its table . &apos; Two hundred young persons , soon waxing to four thousand , &apos;
with fit crowbars , roll towards the Abbaye ; smite asunder the needful
doors ; and bear out their Eleven , with other military victims : -- to
supper in the Palais Royal Garden ; to board , and lodging &apos; in campbeds ,
in the Theatre des Varietes ; &apos; other national Prytaneum as yet not being
in readiness . Most deliberate ! Nay so punctual were these young persons ,
that finding one military victim to have been imprisoned for real civil
crime , they returned him to his cell , with protest .

Why new military force was not called out ? New military force was called
out . New military force did arrive , full gallop , with drawn sabre : but
the people gently &apos; laid hold of their bridles ; &apos; the dragoons sheathed
their swords ; lifted their caps by way of salute , and sat like mere
statues of dragoons , -- except indeed that a drop of liquor being brought
them , they &apos; drank to the King and Nation with the greatest cordiality . &apos; 
( Histoire Parlementaire , ii . 32 . )

And now , ask in return , why Messeigneurs and Broglie the great god of
war , on seeing these things , did not pause , and take some other course ,
any other course ? Unhappily , as we said , they could see nothing . Pride ,
which goes before a fall ; wrath , if not reasonable , yet pardonable ,
most natural , had hardened their hearts and heated their heads ; so ,
with imbecility and violence ( ill @-@ matched pair ) , they rush to seek their
hour . All Regiments are not Gardes Francaises , or debauched by
Valadi the Pythagorean : let fresh undebauched Regiments come up ; let
Royal @-@ Allemand , Salais @-@ Samade , Swiss Chateau @-@ Vieux come up , -- which can
fight , but can hardly speak except in German gutturals ; let soldiers
march , and highways thunder with artillery @-@ waggons : Majesty has a
new Royal Session to hold , -- and miracles to work there ! The whiff of
grapeshot can , if needful , become a blast and tempest .

In which circumstances , before the redhot balls begin raining , may not
the Hundred @-@ and @-@ twenty Paris Electors , though their Cahier is long since
finished , see good to meet again daily , as an &apos; Electoral Club &apos; ? They
meet first &apos; in a Tavern ; &apos; -- where &apos; the largest wedding @-@ party &apos; cheerfully
give place to them . ( Dusaulx , Prise de la Bastille ( Collection des
Memoires , par Berville et Barriere , Paris , 1821 ) , p . 269 . ) But latterly
they meet in the Hotel @-@ de @-@ Ville , in the Townhall itself . Flesselles ,
Provost of Merchants , with his Four Echevins ( Scabins , Assessors ) ,
could not prevent it ; such was the force of public opinion . He , with his
Echevins , and the Six @-@ and @-@ Twenty Town @-@ Councillors , all appointed from
Above , may well sit silent there , in their long gowns ; and consider ,
with awed eye , what prelude this is of convulsion coming from Below , and
how themselves shall fare in that !



Chapter 1.5.IV.

To Arms !

So hangs it , dubious , fateful , in the sultry days of July . It is the
passionate printed advice of M. Marat , to abstain , of all things , from
violence . ( Avis au Peuple , ou les Ministres devoiles , 1st July , 1789
in Histoire Parlementaire , ii . 37 . ) Nevertheless the hungry poor are
already burning Town Barriers , where Tribute on eatables is levied ;
getting clamorous for food .

The twelfth July morning is Sunday ; the streets are all placarded with
an enormous @-@ sized De par le Roi , &apos; inviting peaceable citizens to remain
within doors , &apos; to feel no alarm , to gather in no crowd . Why so ? What
mean these &apos; placards of enormous size &apos; ? Above all , what means this
clatter of military ; dragoons , hussars , rattling in from all points
of the compass towards the Place Louis Quinze ; with a staid gravity of
face , though saluted with mere nicknames , hootings and even missiles ?
( Besenval , iii . 411 . ) Besenval is with them . Swiss Guards of his are
already in the Champs Elysees , with four pieces of artillery .

Have the destroyers descended on us , then ? From the Bridge of Sevres to
utmost Vincennes , from Saint @-@ Denis to the Champ @-@ de @-@ Mars , we are begirt !
Alarm , of the vague unknown , is in every heart . The Palais Royal has
become a place of awestruck interjections , silent shakings of the head :
one can fancy with what dolorous sound the noon @-@ tide cannon ( which the
Sun fires at the crossing of his meridian ) went off there ; bodeful , like
an inarticulate voice of doom . ( Histoire Parlementaire , ii . 81 . ) Are
these troops verily come out &apos; against Brigands &apos; ? Where are the Brigands ?
What mystery is in the wind ? -- Hark ! a human voice reporting articulately
the Job &apos;s @-@ news : Necker , People &apos;s Minister , Saviour of France , is
dismissed . Impossible ; incredible ! Treasonous to the public peace ! Such
a voice ought to be choked in the water @-@ works ; ( Ibid . ) -- had not the
news @-@ bringer quickly fled . Nevertheless , friends , make of it what
you will , the news is true . Necker is gone . Necker hies northward
incessantly , in obedient secrecy , since yesternight . We have a new
Ministry : Broglie the War @-@ god ; Aristocrat Breteuil ; Foulon who said the
people might eat grass !

Rumour , therefore , shall arise ; in the Palais Royal , and in broad
France . Paleness sits on every face ; confused tremor and fremescence ;
waxing into thunder @-@ peals , of Fury stirred on by Fear .

But see Camille Desmoulins , from the Cafe de Foy , rushing out , sibylline
in face ; his hair streaming , in each hand a pistol ! He springs to a
table : the Police satellites are eyeing him ; alive they shall not
take him , not they alive him alive . This time he speaks without
stammering : -- Friends , shall we die like hunted hares ? Like sheep hounded
into their pinfold ; bleating for mercy , where is no mercy , but only a
whetted knife ? The hour is come ; the supreme hour of Frenchman and Man ;
when Oppressors are to try conclusions with Oppressed ; and the word is ,
swift Death , or Deliverance forever . Let such hour be well @-@ come ! Us ,
meseems , one cry only befits : To Arms ! Let universal Paris , universal
France , as with the throat of the whirlwind , sound only : To arms ! -- &quot; To
arms ! &quot; yell responsive the innumerable voices : like one great voice , as
of a Demon yelling from the air : for all faces wax fire @-@ eyed , all hearts
burn up into madness . In such , or fitter words , ( Ibid . ) does Camille
evoke the Elemental Powers , in this great moment . -- Friends , continues
Camille , some rallying sign ! Cockades ; green ones ; -- the colour of
hope ! -- As with the flight of locusts , these green tree leaves ; green
ribands from the neighbouring shops ; all green things are snatched ,
and made cockades of . Camille descends from his table , &apos; stifled with
embraces , wetted with tears ; &apos; has a bit of green riband handed him ;
sticks it in his hat . And now to Curtius &apos; Image @-@ shop there ; to the
Boulevards ; to the four winds ; and rest not till France be on fire !
( Vieux Cordelier , par Camille Desmoulins , No. 5 ( reprinted in Collection
des Memoires , par Baudouin Freres , Paris , 1825 ) , p . 81 . )

France , so long shaken and wind @-@ parched , is probably at the right
inflammable point . -- As for poor Curtius , who , one grieves to think ,
might be but imperfectly paid , -- he cannot make two words about his
Images . The Wax @-@ bust of Necker , the Wax @-@ bust of D &apos;Orleans , helpers of
France : these , covered with crape , as in funeral procession , or after
the manner of suppliants appealing to Heaven , to Earth , and Tartarus
itself , a mixed multitude bears off . For a sign ! As indeed man , with his
singular imaginative faculties , can do little or nothing without signs :
thus Turks look to their Prophet &apos;s banner ; also Osier Mannikins have
been burnt , and Necker &apos;s Portrait has erewhile figured , aloft on its
perch .

In this manner march they , a mixed , continually increasing multitude ;
armed with axes , staves and miscellanea ; grim , many @-@ sounding , through
the streets . Be all Theatres shut ; let all dancing , on planked floor ,
or on the natural greensward , cease ! Instead of a Christian Sabbath , and
feast of guinguette tabernacles , it shall be a Sorcerer &apos;s Sabbath ; and
Paris , gone rabid , dance , -- with the Fiend for piper !

However , Besenval , with horse and foot , is in the Place Louis Quinze .
Mortals promenading homewards , in the fall of the day , saunter by , from
Chaillot or Passy , from flirtation and a little thin wine ; with sadder
step than usual . Will the Bust @-@ Procession pass that way ! Behold it ;
behold also Prince Lambesc dash forth on it , with his Royal @-@ Allemands !
Shots fall , and sabre @-@ strokes ; Busts are hewn asunder ; and , alas , also
heads of men . A sabred Procession has nothing for it but to explode ,
along what streets , alleys , Tuileries Avenues it finds ; and disappear .
One unarmed man lies hewed down ; a Garde Francaise by his uniform :
bear him ( or bear even the report of him ) dead and gory to his
Barracks ; -- where he has comrades still alive !

But why not now , victorious Lambesc , charge through that Tuileries
Garden itself , where the fugitives are vanishing ? Not show the Sunday
promenaders too , how steel glitters , besprent with blood ; that it be
told of , and men &apos;s ears tingle ? -- Tingle , alas , they did ; but the
wrong way . Victorious Lambesc , in this his second or Tuileries charge ,
succeeds but in overturning ( call it not slashing , for he struck
with the flat of his sword ) one man , a poor old schoolmaster , most
pacifically tottering there ; and is driven out , by barricade of chairs ,
by flights of &apos; bottles and glasses , &apos; by execrations in bass voice and
treble . Most delicate is the mob @-@ queller &apos;s vocation ; wherein Too @-@ much
may be as bad as Not @-@ enough . For each of these bass voices , and more
each treble voice , borne to all points of the City , rings now nothing
but distracted indignation ; will ring all another . The cry , To arms !
roars tenfold ; steeples with their metal storm @-@ voice boom out , as the
sun sinks ; armorer &apos;s shops are broken open , plundered ; the streets are a
living foam @-@ sea , chafed by all the winds .

Such issue came of Lambesc &apos;s charge on the Tuileries Garden : no striking
of salutary terror into Chaillot promenaders ; a striking into broad
wakefulness of Frenzy and the three Furies , -- which otherwise were not
asleep ! For they lie always , those subterranean Eumenides ( fabulous
and yet so true ) , in the dullest existence of man ; -- and can dance ,
brandishing their dusky torches , shaking their serpent @-@ hair . Lambesc
with Royal @-@ Allemand may ride to his barracks , with curses for his
marching @-@ music ; then ride back again , like one troubled in mind :
vengeful Gardes Francaises , sacreing , with knit brows , start out on
him , from their barracks in the Chaussee d &apos;Antin ; pour a volley into him
( killing and wounding ) ; which he must not answer , but ride on . ( Weber ,
ii . 75 @-@ 91 . )

Counsel dwells not under the plumed hat . If the Eumenides awaken , and
Broglie has given no orders , what can a Besenval do ? When the Gardes
Francaises , with Palais @-@ Royal volunteers , roll down , greedy of more
vengeance , to the Place Louis Quinze itself , they find neither Besenval ,
Lambesc , Royal @-@ Allemand , nor any soldier now there . Gone is military
order . On the far Eastern Boulevard , of Saint @-@ Antoine , the Chasseurs
Normandie arrive , dusty , thirsty , after a hard day &apos;s ride ; but can find
no billet @-@ master , see no course in this City of confusions ; cannot get
to Besenval , cannot so much as discover where he is : Normandie must even
bivouac there , in its dust and thirst , -- unless some patriot will treat
it to a cup of liquor , with advices .

Raging multitudes surround the Hotel @-@ de @-@ Ville , crying : Arms ! Orders !
The Six @-@ and @-@ twenty Town @-@ Councillors , with their long gowns , have ducked
under ( into the raging chaos ) ; -- shall never emerge more . Besenval is
painfully wriggling himself out , to the Champ @-@ de @-@ Mars ; he must sit there
&apos;in the cruelest uncertainty : &apos; courier after courier may dash off for
Versailles ; but will bring back no answer , can hardly bring himself
back . For the roads are all blocked with batteries and pickets , with
floods of carriages arrested for examination : such was Broglie &apos;s one
sole order ; the Oeil @-@ de @-@ Boeuf , hearing in the distance such mad din ,
which sounded almost like invasion , will before all things keep its
own head whole . A new Ministry , with , as it were , but one foot in the
stirrup , cannot take leaps . Mad Paris is abandoned altogether to itself .

What a Paris , when the darkness fell ! A European metropolitan City
hurled suddenly forth from its old combinations and arrangements ; to
crash tumultuously together , seeking new . Use and wont will now no
longer direct any man ; each man , with what of originality he has , must
begin thinking ; or following those that think . Seven hundred thousand
individuals , on the sudden , find all their old paths , old ways of acting
and deciding , vanish from under their feet . And so there go they , with
clangour and terror , they know not as yet whether running , swimming
or flying , -- headlong into the New Era . With clangour and terror : from
above , Broglie the war @-@ god impends , preternatural , with his redhot
cannon @-@ balls ; and from below , a preternatural Brigand @-@ world menaces with
dirk and firebrand : madness rules the hour .

Happily , in place of the submerged Twenty @-@ six , the Electoral Club is
gathering ; has declared itself a &apos; Provisional Municipality . &apos; On the
morrow it will get Provost Flesselles , with an Echevin or two , to give
help in many things . For the present it decrees one most essential
thing : that forthwith a &apos; Parisian Militia &apos; shall be enrolled . Depart ,
ye heads of Districts , to labour in this great work ; while we here , in
Permanent Committee , sit alert . Let fencible men , each party in its
own range of streets , keep watch and ward , all night . Let Paris court a
little fever @-@ sleep ; confused by such fever @-@ dreams , of &apos; violent motions
at the Palais Royal ; &apos; -- or from time to time start awake , and look
out , palpitating , in its nightcap , at the clash of discordant
mutually @-@ unintelligible Patrols ; on the gleam of distant Barriers , going
up all @-@ too ruddy towards the vault of Night . ( Deux Amis , i . 267 @-@ 306 . )



Chapter 1.5.V.

Give us Arms .

On Monday the huge City has awoke , not to its week @-@ day industry : to what
a different one ! The working man has become a fighting man ; has one want
only : that of arms . The industry of all crafts has paused ; -- except it
be the smith &apos;s , fiercely hammering pikes ; and , in a faint degree , the
kitchener &apos;s , cooking off @-@ hand victuals ; for bouche va toujours . Women
too are sewing cockades ; -- not now of green , which being D &apos;Artois colour ,
the Hotel @-@ de @-@ Ville has had to interfere in it ; but of red and blue ,
our old Paris colours : these , once based on a ground of constitutional
white , are the famed TRICOLOR , -- which ( if Prophecy err not ) &apos; will go
round the world . &apos; 

All shops , unless it be the Bakers &apos; and Vintners &apos; , are shut : Paris is
in the streets ; -- rushing , foaming like some Venice wine @-@ glass into which
you had dropped poison . The tocsin , by order , is pealing madly from
all steeples . Arms , ye Elector Municipals ; thou Flesselles with thy
Echevins , give us arms ! Flesselles gives what he can : fallacious ,
perhaps insidious promises of arms from Charleville ; order to seek arms
here , order to seek them there . The new Municipals give what they can ;
some three hundred and sixty indifferent firelocks , the equipment of the
City @-@ Watch : &apos; a man in wooden shoes , and without coat , directly clutches
one of them , and mounts guard . &apos; Also as hinted , an order to all Smiths
to make pikes with their whole soul .

Heads of Districts are in fervent consultation ; subordinate Patriotism
roams distracted , ravenous for arms . Hitherto at the Hotel @-@ de @-@ Ville
was only such modicum of indifferent firelocks as we have seen . At
the so @-@ called Arsenal , there lies nothing but rust , rubbish and
saltpetre , -- overlooked too by the guns of the Bastille . His Majesty &apos;s
Repository , what they call Garde @-@ Meuble , is forced and ransacked :
tapestries enough , and gauderies ; but of serviceable fighting @-@ gear small
stock ! Two silver @-@ mounted cannons there are ; an ancient gift from his
Majesty of Siam to Louis Fourteenth : gilt sword of the Good Henri ;
antique Chivalry arms and armour . These , and such as these , a
necessitous Patriotism snatches greedily , for want of better . The
Siamese cannons go trundling , on an errand they were not meant for .
Among the indifferent firelocks are seen tourney @-@ lances ; the princely
helm and hauberk glittering amid ill @-@ hatted heads , -- as in a time when
all times and their possessions are suddenly sent jumbling !

At the Maison de Saint @-@ Lazare , Lazar @-@ House once , now a Correction @-@ House
with Priests , there was no trace of arms ; but , on the other hand , corn ,
plainly to a culpable extent . Out with it , to market ; in this scarcity
of grains ! -- Heavens , will &apos; fifty @-@ two carts , &apos; in long row , hardly carry
it to the Halle aux Bleds ? Well , truly , ye reverend Fathers , was your
pantry filled ; fat are your larders ; over @-@ generous your wine @-@ bins , ye
plotting exasperators of the Poor ; traitorous forestallers of bread !

Vain is protesting , entreaty on bare knees : the House of Saint @-@ Lazarus
has that in it which comes not out by protesting . Behold , how , from
every window , it vomits : mere torrents of furniture , of bellowing and
hurlyburly ; -- the cellars also leaking wine . Till , as was natural , smoke
rose , -- kindled , some say , by the desperate Saint @-@ Lazaristes themselves ,
desperate of other riddance ; and the Establishment vanished from this
world in flame . Remark nevertheless that &apos; a thief &apos; ( set on or not by
Aristocrats ) , being detected there , is &apos; instantly hanged . &apos; 

Look also at the Chatelet Prison . The Debtors &apos; Prison of La Force is
broken from without ; and they that sat in bondage to Aristocrats go
free : hearing of which the Felons at the Chatelet do likewise &apos; dig
up their pavements , &apos; and stand on the offensive ; with the best
prospects , -- had not Patriotism , passing that way , &apos; fired a volley &apos; into
the Felon world ; and crushed it down again under hatches . Patriotism
consorts not with thieving and felony : surely also Punishment , this
day , hitches ( if she still hitch ) after Crime , with frightful
shoes @-@ of @-@ swiftness ! &apos; Some score or two &apos; of wretched persons , found
prostrate with drink in the cellars of that Saint @-@ Lazare , are
indignantly haled to prison ; the Jailor has no room ; whereupon , other
place of security not suggesting itself , it is written , &apos; on les pendit ,
they hanged them . &apos; ( Histoire Parlementaire , ii . 96 . ) Brief is the word ;
not without significance , be it true or untrue !

In such circumstances , the Aristocrat , the unpatriotic rich man is
packing @-@ up for departure . But he shall not get departed . A wooden @-@ shod
force has seized all Barriers , burnt or not : all that enters , all that
seeks to issue , is stopped there , and dragged to the Hotel @-@ de @-@ Ville :
coaches , tumbrils , plate , furniture , &apos; many meal @-@ sacks , &apos; in time even
&apos;flocks and herds &apos; encumber the Place de Greve . ( Dusaulx , Prise de la
Bastille , p . 20 . )

And so it roars , and rages , and brays ; drums beating , steeples pealing ;
criers rushing with hand @-@ bells : &quot; Oyez , oyez . All men to their Districts
to be enrolled ! &quot; The Districts have met in gardens , open squares ; are
getting marshalled into volunteer troops . No redhot ball has yet fallen
from Besenval &apos;s Camp ; on the contrary , Deserters with their arms are
continually dropping in : nay now , joy of joys , at two in the afternoon ,
the Gardes Francaises , being ordered to Saint @-@ Denis , and flatly
declining , have come over in a body ! It is a fact worth many .
Three thousand six hundred of the best fighting men , with complete
accoutrement ; with cannoneers even , and cannon ! Their officers are left
standing alone ; could not so much as succeed in &apos; spiking the guns . &apos; The
very Swiss , it may now be hoped , Chateau @-@ Vieux and the others , will have
doubts about fighting .

Our Parisian Militia , -- which some think it were better to name National
Guard , -- is prospering as heart could wish . It promised to be forty @-@ eight
thousand ; but will in few hours double and quadruple that number :
invincible , if we had only arms !

But see , the promised Charleville Boxes , marked Artillerie ! Here , then ,
are arms enough ? -- Conceive the blank face of Patriotism , when it found
them filled with rags , foul linen , candle @-@ ends , and bits of wood !
Provost of the Merchants , how is this ? Neither at the Chartreux Convent ,
whither we were sent with signed order , is there or ever was there any
weapon of war . Nay here , in this Seine Boat , safe under tarpaulings
( had not the nose of Patriotism been of the finest ) , are &apos; five
thousand @-@ weight of gunpowder ; &apos; not coming in , but surreptitiously
going out ! What meanest thou , Flesselles ? &apos; Tis a ticklish game , that of
&apos;amusing &apos; us . Cat plays with captive mouse : but mouse with enraged cat ,
with enraged National Tiger ?

Meanwhile , the faster , O ye black @-@ aproned Smiths , smite ; with strong
arm and willing heart . This man and that , all stroke from head to heel ,
shall thunder alternating , and ply the great forge @-@ hammer , till
stithy reel and ring again ; while ever and anon , overhead , booms the
alarm @-@ cannon , -- for the City has now got gunpowder . Pikes are fabricated ;
fifty thousand of them , in six @-@ and @-@ thirty hours : judge whether the
Black @-@ aproned have been idle . Dig trenches , unpave the streets , ye
others , assiduous , man and maid ; cram the earth in barrel @-@ barricades , at
each of them a volunteer sentry ; pile the whinstones in window @-@ sills and
upper rooms . Have scalding pitch , at least boiling water ready , ye
weak old women , to pour it and dash it on Royal @-@ Allemand , with your
old skinny arms : your shrill curses along with it will not be
wanting ! -- Patrols of the newborn National Guard , bearing torches , scour
the streets , all that night ; which otherwise are vacant , yet illuminated
in every window by order . Strange @-@ looking ; like some naphtha @-@ lighted
City of the Dead , with here and there a flight of perturbed Ghosts .

O poor mortals , how ye make this Earth bitter for each other ; this
fearful and wonderful Life fearful and horrible ; and Satan has his place
in all hearts ! Such agonies and ragings and wailings ye have , and have
had , in all times : -- to be buried all , in so deep silence ; and the salt
sea is not swoln with your tears .

Great meanwhile is the moment , when tidings of Freedom reach us ; when
the long @-@ enthralled soul , from amid its chains and squalid stagnancy ,
arises , were it still only in blindness and bewilderment , and swears by
Him that made it , that it will be free ! Free ? Understand that well , it
is the deep commandment , dimmer or clearer , of our whole being , to be
free . Freedom is the one purport , wisely aimed at , or unwisely , of all
man &apos;s struggles , toilings and sufferings , in this Earth . Yes , supreme is
such a moment ( if thou have known it ) : first vision as of a flame @-@ girt
Sinai , in this our waste Pilgrimage , -- which thenceforth wants not its
pillar of cloud by day , and pillar of fire by night ! Something it
is even , -- nay , something considerable , when the chains have grown
corrosive , poisonous , to be free &apos; from oppression by our fellow @-@ man . &apos; 
Forward , ye maddened sons of France ; be it towards this destiny or
towards that ! Around you is but starvation , falsehood , corruption and
the clam of death . Where ye are is no abiding .

Imagination may , imperfectly , figure how Commandant Besenval , in the
Champ @-@ de @-@ Mars , has worn out these sorrowful hours Insurrection all
round ; his men melting away ! From Versailles , to the most pressing
messages , comes no answer ; or once only some vague word of answer which
is worse than none . A Council of Officers can decide merely that there
is no decision : Colonels inform him , &apos; weeping , &apos; that they do not think
their men will fight . Cruel uncertainty is here : war @-@ god Broglie sits
yonder , inaccessible in his Olympus ; does not descend terror @-@ clad , does
not produce his whiff of grapeshot ; sends no orders .

Truly , in the Chateau of Versailles all seems mystery : in the Town of
Versailles , were we there , all is rumour , alarm and indignation . An
august National Assembly sits , to appearance , menaced with death ;
endeavouring to defy death . It has resolved &apos; that Necker carries with
him the regrets of the Nation . &apos; It has sent solemn Deputation over to
the Chateau , with entreaty to have these troops withdrawn . In vain : his
Majesty , with a singular composure , invites us to be busy rather with
our own duty , making the Constitution ! Foreign Pandours , and suchlike ,
go pricking and prancing , with a swashbuckler air ; with an eye too
probably to the Salle des Menus , -- were it not for the &apos; grim @-@ looking
countenances &apos; that crowd all avenues there . ( See Lameth ; Ferrieres ,
&amp; c . ) Be firm , ye National Senators ; the cynosure of a firm , grim @-@ looking
people !

The august National Senators determine that there shall , at least , be
Permanent Session till this thing end . Wherein , however , consider that
worthy Lafranc de Pompignan , our new President , whom we have named
Bailly &apos;s successor , is an old man , wearied with many things . He is
the Brother of that Pompignan who meditated lamentably on the Book of
Lamentations :

Saves @-@ voux pourquoi Jeremie
Se lamentait toute sa vie ?
C &apos;est qu &apos;il prevoyait
Que Pompignan le traduirait !

Poor Bishop Pompignan withdraws ; having got Lafayette for helper or
substitute : this latter , as nocturnal Vice @-@ President , with a thin house
in disconsolate humour , sits sleepless , with lights unsnuffed ; -- waiting
what the hours will bring .

So at Versailles . But at Paris , agitated Besenval , before retiring
for the night , has stept over to old M. de Sombreuil , of the Hotel des
Invalides hard by . M. de Sombreuil has , what is a great secret , some
eight @-@ and @-@ twenty thousand stand of muskets deposited in his cellars
there ; but no trust in the temper of his Invalides . This day , for
example , he sent twenty of the fellows down to unscrew those muskets ;
lest Sedition might snatch at them ; but scarcely , in six hours , had the
twenty unscrewed twenty gun @-@ locks , or dogsheads ( chiens ) of locks , -- each
Invalide his dogshead ! If ordered to fire , they would , he imagines , turn
their cannon against himself .

Unfortunate old military gentlemen , it is your hour , not of glory ! Old
Marquis de Launay too , of the Bastille , has pulled up his drawbridges
long since , &apos; and retired into his interior ; &apos; with sentries walking
on his battlements , under the midnight sky , aloft over the glare of
illuminated Paris ; -- whom a National Patrol , passing that way , takes the
liberty of firing at ; &apos; seven shots towards twelve at night , &apos; which do
not take effect . ( Deux Amis de la Liberte , i . 312 . ) This was the 13th
day of July , 1789 ; a worse day , many said , than the last 13th was , when
only hail fell out of Heaven , not madness rose out of Tophet , ruining
worse than crops !

In these same days , as Chronology will teach us , hot old Marquis
Mirabeau lies stricken down , at Argenteuil , -- not within sound of these
alarm @-@ guns ; for he properly is not there , and only the body of him now
lies , deaf and cold forever . It was on Saturday night that he , drawing
his last life @-@ breaths , gave up the ghost there ; -- leaving a world , which
would never go to his mind , now broken out , seemingly , into deliration
and the culbute generale . What is it to him , departing elsewhither , on
his long journey ? The old Chateau Mirabeau stands silent , far off , on
its scarped rock , in that &apos; gorge of two windy valleys ; &apos; the pale @-@ fading
spectre now of a Chateau : this huge World @-@ riot , and France , and the
World itself , fades also , like a shadow on the great still mirror @-@ sea ;
and all shall be as God wills .

Young Mirabeau , sad of heart , for he loved this crabbed brave old
Father , sad of heart , and occupied with sad cares , -- is withdrawn from
Public History . The great crisis transacts itself without him . ( Fils
Adoptif , Mirabeau , vi. l . 1 . )



Chapter 1.5.VI.

Storm and Victory .

But , to the living and the struggling , a new , Fourteenth morning dawns .
Under all roofs of this distracted City , is the nodus of a drama , not
untragical , crowding towards solution . The bustlings and preparings ,
the tremors and menaces ; the tears that fell from old eyes ! This day , my
sons , ye shall quit you like men . By the memory of your fathers &apos; wrongs ,
by the hope of your children &apos;s rights ! Tyranny impends in red wrath :
help for you is none if not in your own right hands . This day ye must do
or die .

From earliest light , a sleepless Permanent Committee has heard the
old cry , now waxing almost frantic , mutinous : Arms ! Arms ! Provost
Flesselles , or what traitors there are among you , may think of those
Charleville Boxes . A hundred @-@ and @-@ fifty thousand of us ; and but the third
man furnished with so much as a pike ! Arms are the one thing needful :
with arms we are an unconquerable man @-@ defying National Guard ; without
arms , a rabble to be whiffed with grapeshot .

Happily the word has arisen , for no secret can be kept , -- that there lie
muskets at the Hotel des Invalides . Thither will we : King &apos;s Procureur
M. Ethys de Corny , and whatsoever of authority a Permanent Committee can
lend , shall go with us . Besenval &apos;s Camp is there ; perhaps he will not
fire on us ; if he kill us we shall but die .

Alas , poor Besenval , with his troops melting away in that manner , has
not the smallest humour to fire ! At five o &apos;clock this morning , as he lay
dreaming , oblivious in the Ecole Militaire , a &apos; figure &apos; stood suddenly at
his bedside : &apos; with face rather handsome ; eyes inflamed , speech rapid and
curt , air audacious : &apos; such a figure drew Priam &apos;s curtains ! The message
and monition of the figure was , that resistance would be hopeless ;
that if blood flowed , wo to him who shed it . Thus spoke the figure ;
and vanished . &apos; Withal there was a kind of eloquence that struck
one . &apos; Besenval admits that he should have arrested him , but did not .
( Besenval , iii . 414 . ) Who this figure , with inflamed eyes , with speech
rapid and curt , might be ? Besenval knows but mentions not . Camille
Desmoulins ? Pythagorean Marquis Valadi , inflamed with &apos; violent motions
all night at the Palais Royal ? &apos; Fame names him , &apos; Young M. Meillar &apos; ;
( Tableaux de la Revolution , Prise de la Bastille ( a folio Collection
of Pictures and Portraits , with letter @-@ press , not always
uninstructive , -- part of it said to be by Chamfort ) . ) Then shuts her lips
about him for ever .

In any case , behold about nine in the morning , our National Volunteers
rolling in long wide flood , south @-@ westward to the Hotel des Invalides ;
in search of the one thing needful . King &apos;s procureur M. Ethys de Corny
and officials are there ; the Cure of Saint @-@ Etienne du Mont marches
unpacific , at the head of his militant Parish ; the Clerks of the
Bazoche in red coats we see marching , now Volunteers of the Bazoche ; the
Volunteers of the Palais Royal : -- National Volunteers , numerable by
tens of thousands ; of one heart and mind . The King &apos;s muskets are the
Nation &apos;s ; think , old M. de Sombreuil , how , in this extremity , thou wilt
refuse them ! Old M. de Sombreuil would fain hold parley , send Couriers ;
but it skills not : the walls are scaled , no Invalide firing a shot ;
the gates must be flung open . Patriotism rushes in , tumultuous , from
grundsel up to ridge @-@ tile , through all rooms and passages ; rummaging
distractedly for arms . What cellar , or what cranny can escape it ? The
arms are found ; all safe there ; lying packed in straw , -- apparently with
a view to being burnt ! More ravenous than famishing lions over dead
prey , the multitude , with clangour and vociferation , pounces on them ;
struggling , dashing , clutching : -- to the jamming @-@ up , to the pressure ,
fracture and probable extinction , of the weaker Patriot . ( Deux Amis , i .
302 . ) And so , with such protracted crash of deafening , most discordant
Orchestra @-@ music , the Scene is changed : and eight @-@ and @-@ twenty thousand
sufficient firelocks are on the shoulders of so many National Guards ,
lifted thereby out of darkness into fiery light .

Let Besenval look at the glitter of these muskets , as they flash by !
Gardes Francaises , it is said , have cannon levelled on him ; ready to
open , if need were , from the other side of the River . ( Besenval , iii .
416 . ) Motionless sits he ; &apos; astonished , &apos; one may flatter oneself , &apos; at
the proud bearing ( fiere contenance ) of the Parisians . &apos; -- And now , to
the Bastille , ye intrepid Parisians ! There grapeshot still threatens ;
thither all men &apos;s thoughts and steps are now tending .

Old de Launay , as we hinted , withdrew &apos; into his interior &apos; soon after
midnight of Sunday . He remains there ever since , hampered , as all
military gentlemen now are , in the saddest conflict of uncertainties .
The Hotel @-@ de @-@ Ville &apos; invites &apos; him to admit National Soldiers , which is a
soft name for surrendering . On the other hand , His Majesty &apos;s orders were
precise . His garrison is but eighty @-@ two old Invalides , reinforced by
thirty @-@ two young Swiss ; his walls indeed are nine feet thick , he has
cannon and powder ; but , alas , only one day &apos;s provision of victuals . The
city too is French , the poor garrison mostly French . Rigorous old de
Launay , think what thou wilt do !

All morning , since nine , there has been a cry everywhere : To the
Bastille ! Repeated &apos; deputations of citizens &apos; have been here , passionate
for arms ; whom de Launay has got dismissed by soft speeches through
portholes . Towards noon , Elector Thuriot de la Rosiere gains admittance ;
finds de Launay indisposed for surrender ; nay disposed for blowing up
the place rather . Thuriot mounts with him to the battlements : heaps
of paving @-@ stones , old iron and missiles lie piled ; cannon all duly
levelled ; in every embrasure a cannon , -- only drawn back a little ! But
outwards behold , O Thuriot , how the multitude flows on , welling through
every street ; tocsin furiously pealing , all drums beating the generale :
the Suburb Saint @-@ Antoine rolling hitherward wholly , as one man ! Such
vision ( spectral yet real ) thou , O Thuriot , as from thy Mount of Vision ,
beholdest in this moment : prophetic of what other Phantasmagories , and
loud @-@ gibbering Spectral Realities , which , thou yet beholdest not , but
shalt ! &quot; Que voulez vous ? &quot; said de Launay , turning pale at the sight ,
with an air of reproach , almost of menace . &quot; Monsieur , &quot; said Thuriot ,
rising into the moral @-@ sublime , &quot; What mean you ? Consider if I could not
precipitate both of us from this height , &quot; -- say only a hundred feet ,
exclusive of the walled ditch ! Whereupon de Launay fell silent . Thuriot
shews himself from some pinnacle , to comfort the multitude becoming
suspicious , fremescent : then descends ; departs with protest ; with
warning addressed also to the Invalides , -- on whom , however , it produces
but a mixed indistinct impression . The old heads are none of the
clearest ; besides , it is said , de Launay has been profuse of beverages
( prodigua des buissons ) . They think , they will not fire , -- if not fired
on , if they can help it ; but must , on the whole , be ruled considerably
by circumstances .

Wo to thee , de Launay , in such an hour , if thou canst not , taking some
one firm decision , rule circumstances ! Soft speeches will not serve ;
hard grape @-@ shot is questionable ; but hovering between the two is
unquestionable . Ever wilder swells the tide of men ; their infinite hum
waxing ever louder , into imprecations , perhaps into crackle of stray
musketry , -- which latter , on walls nine feet thick , cannot do execution .
The Outer Drawbridge has been lowered for Thuriot ; new deputation of
citizens ( it is the third , and noisiest of all ) penetrates that way
into the Outer Court : soft speeches producing no clearance of these , de
Launay gives fire ; pulls up his Drawbridge . A slight sputter ; -- which has
kindled the too combustible chaos ; made it a roaring fire @-@ chaos ! Bursts
forth insurrection , at sight of its own blood ( for there were deaths
by that sputter of fire ) , into endless rolling explosion of musketry ,
distraction , execration ; -- and overhead , from the Fortress , let one great
gun , with its grape @-@ shot , go booming , to shew what we could do . The
Bastille is besieged !

On , then , all Frenchmen that have hearts in their bodies ! Roar with
all your throats , of cartilage and metal , ye Sons of Liberty ; stir
spasmodically whatsoever of utmost faculty is in you , soul , body or
spirit ; for it is the hour ! Smite , thou Louis Tournay , cartwright of
the Marais , old @-@ soldier of the Regiment Dauphine ; smite at that Outer
Drawbridge chain , though the fiery hail whistles round thee ! Never , over
nave or felloe , did thy axe strike such a stroke . Down with it , man ;
down with it to Orcus : let the whole accursed Edifice sink thither , and
Tyranny be swallowed up for ever ! Mounted , some say on the roof of the
guard @-@ room , some &apos; on bayonets stuck into joints of the wall , &apos; Louis
Tournay smites , brave Aubin Bonnemere ( also an old soldier ) seconding
him : the chain yields , breaks ; the huge Drawbridge slams down ,
thundering ( avec fracas ) . Glorious : and yet , alas , it is still but the
outworks . The Eight grim Towers , with their Invalides &apos; musketry , their
paving stones and cannon @-@ mouths , still soar aloft intact ; -- Ditch yawning
impassable , stone @-@ faced ; the inner Drawbridge with its back towards us :
the Bastille is still to take !

To describe this Siege of the Bastille ( thought to be one of the most
important in history ) perhaps transcends the talent of mortals . Could
one but , after infinite reading , get to understand so much as the plan
of the building ! But there is open Esplanade , at the end of the Rue
Saint @-@ Antoine ; there are such Forecourts , Cour Avance , Cour de l &apos;Orme ,
arched Gateway ( where Louis Tournay now fights ) ; then new drawbridges ,
dormant @-@ bridges , rampart @-@ bastions , and the grim Eight Towers : a
labyrinthic Mass , high @-@ frowning there , of all ages from twenty years
to four hundred and twenty ; -- beleaguered , in this its last hour , as we
said , by mere Chaos come again ! Ordnance of all calibres ; throats of all
capacities ; men of all plans , every man his own engineer : seldom since
the war of Pygmies and Cranes was there seen so anomalous a thing .
Half @-@ pay Elie is home for a suit of regimentals ; no one would heed him
in coloured clothes : half @-@ pay Hulin is haranguing Gardes Francaises in
the Place de Greve . Frantic Patriots pick up the grape @-@ shots ; bear
them , still hot ( or seemingly so ) , to the Hotel @-@ de @-@ Ville : -- Paris , you
perceive , is to be burnt ! Flesselles is &apos; pale to the very lips &apos; for the
roar of the multitude grows deep . Paris wholly has got to the
acme of its frenzy ; whirled , all ways , by panic madness . At
every street @-@ barricade , there whirls simmering , a minor
whirlpool , -- strengthening the barricade , since God knows what is
coming ; and all minor whirlpools play distractedly into that grand
Fire @-@ Mahlstrom which is lashing round the Bastille .

And so it lashes and it roars . Cholat the wine @-@ merchant has become an
impromptu cannoneer . See Georget , of the Marine Service , fresh from
Brest , ply the King of Siam &apos;s cannon . Singular ( if we were not used to
the like ) : Georget lay , last night , taking his ease at his inn ; the King
of Siam &apos;s cannon also lay , knowing nothing of him , for a hundred years .
Yet now , at the right instant , they have got together , and discourse
eloquent music . For , hearing what was toward , Georget sprang from the
Brest Diligence , and ran . Gardes Francaises also will be here , with real
artillery : were not the walls so thick ! -- Upwards from the Esplanade ,
horizontally from all neighbouring roofs and windows , flashes one
irregular deluge of musketry , -- without effect . The Invalides lie flat ,
firing comparatively at their ease from behind stone ; hardly through
portholes , shew the tip of a nose . We fall , shot ; and make no
impression !

Let conflagration rage ; of whatsoever is combustible ! Guard @-@ rooms are
burnt , Invalides mess @-@ rooms . A distracted &apos; Peruke @-@ maker with two fiery
torches &apos; is for burning &apos; the saltpetres of the Arsenal ; &apos; -- had not a
woman run screaming ; had not a Patriot , with some tincture of Natural
Philosophy , instantly struck the wind out of him ( butt of musket on pit
of stomach ) , overturned barrels , and stayed the devouring element . A
young beautiful lady , seized escaping in these Outer Courts , and thought
falsely to be de Launay &apos;s daughter , shall be burnt in de Launay &apos;s sight ;
she lies swooned on a paillasse : but again a Patriot , it is brave Aubin
Bonnemere the old soldier , dashes in , and rescues her . Straw is burnt ;
three cartloads of it , hauled thither , go up in white smoke : almost to
the choking of Patriotism itself ; so that Elie had , with singed brows ,
to drag back one cart ; and Reole the &apos; gigantic haberdasher &apos; another .
Smoke as of Tophet ; confusion as of Babel ; noise as of the Crack of
Doom !

Blood flows , the aliment of new madness . The wounded are carried into
houses of the Rue Cerisaie ; the dying leave their last mandate not to
yield till the accursed Stronghold fall . And yet , alas , how fall ?
The walls are so thick ! Deputations , three in number , arrive from the
Hotel @-@ de @-@ Ville ; Abbe Fouchet ( who was of one ) can say , with what almost
superhuman courage of benevolence . ( Fauchet &apos;s Narrative ( Deux Amis , i .
324 . ) . ) These wave their Town @-@ flag in the arched Gateway ; and stand ,
rolling their drum ; but to no purpose . In such Crack of Doom , de Launay
cannot hear them , dare not believe them : they return , with justified
rage , the whew of lead still singing in their ears . What to do ? The
Firemen are here , squirting with their fire @-@ pumps on the Invalides&apos;
cannon , to wet the touchholes ; they unfortunately cannot squirt so high ;
but produce only clouds of spray . Individuals of classical knowledge
propose catapults . Santerre , the sonorous Brewer of the Suburb
Saint @-@ Antoine , advises rather that the place be fired , by a &apos; mixture of
phosphorous and oil @-@ of @-@ turpentine spouted up through forcing pumps : &apos;
O Spinola @-@ Santerre , hast thou the mixture ready ? Every man his own
engineer ! And still the fire @-@ deluge abates not ; even women are firing ,
and Turks ; at least one woman ( with her sweetheart ) , and one Turk . ( Deux
Amis ( i . 319 ) ; Dusaulx , &amp; c . ) Gardes Francaises have come : real cannon ,
real cannoneers . Usher Maillard is busy ; half @-@ pay Elie , half @-@ pay Hulin
rage in the midst of thousands .

How the great Bastille Clock ticks ( inaudible ) in its Inner Court there ,
at its ease , hour after hour ; as if nothing special , for it or the
world , were passing ! It tolled One when the firing began ; and is now
pointing towards Five , and still the firing slakes not . -- Far down , in
their vaults , the seven Prisoners hear muffled din as of earthquakes ;
their Turnkeys answer vaguely .

Wo to thee , de Launay , with thy poor hundred Invalides ! Broglie is
distant , and his ears heavy : Besenval hears , but can send no help . One
poor troop of Hussars has crept , reconnoitring , cautiously along the
Quais , as far as the Pont Neuf . &quot; We are come to join you , &quot; said
the Captain ; for the crowd seems shoreless . A large @-@ headed dwarfish
individual , of smoke @-@ bleared aspect , shambles forward , opening his blue
lips , for there is sense in him ; and croaks : &quot; Alight then , and give
up your arms ! &quot; the Hussar @-@ Captain is too happy to be escorted to the
Barriers , and dismissed on parole . Who the squat individual was ? Men
answer , it is M. Marat , author of the excellent pacific Avis au Peuple !
Great truly , O thou remarkable Dogleech , is this thy day of emergence
and new birth : and yet this same day come four years -- ! -- But let the
curtains of the future hang .

What shall de Launay do ? One thing only de Launay could have done : what
he said he would do . Fancy him sitting , from the first , with lighted
taper , within arm &apos;s length of the Powder @-@ Magazine ; motionless , like old
Roman Senator , or bronze Lamp @-@ holder ; coldly apprising Thuriot , and all
men , by a slight motion of his eye , what his resolution was : -- Harmless
he sat there , while unharmed ; but the King &apos;s Fortress , meanwhile , could ,
might , would , or should , in nowise , be surrendered , save to the King &apos;s
Messenger : one old man &apos;s life worthless , so it be lost with honour ;
but think , ye brawling canaille , how will it be when a whole Bastille
springs skyward ! -- In such statuesque , taper @-@ holding attitude , one
fancies de Launay might have left Thuriot , the red Clerks of the
Bazoche , Cure of Saint @-@ Stephen and all the tagrag @-@ and @-@ bobtail of the
world , to work their will .

And yet , withal , he could not do it . Hast thou considered how each man &apos;s
heart is so tremulously responsive to the hearts of all men ; hast thou
noted how omnipotent is the very sound of many men ? How their shriek
of indignation palsies the strong soul ; their howl of contumely withers
with unfelt pangs ? The Ritter Gluck confessed that the ground @-@ tone of
the noblest passage , in one of his noblest Operas , was the voice of the
Populace he had heard at Vienna , crying to their Kaiser : Bread ! Bread !
Great is the combined voice of men ; the utterance of their instincts ,
which are truer than their thoughts : it is the greatest a man
encounters , among the sounds and shadows , which make up this World of
Time . He who can resist that , has his footing some where beyond Time . De
Launay could not do it . Distracted , he hovers between the two ; hopes
in the middle of despair ; surrenders not his Fortress ; declares that
he will blow it up , seizes torches to blow it up , and does not blow it .
Unhappy old de Launay , it is the death @-@ agony of thy Bastille and thee !
Jail , Jailoring and Jailor , all three , such as they may have been , must
finish .

For four hours now has the World @-@ Bedlam roared : call it the
World @-@ Chimaera , blowing fire ! The poor Invalides have sunk under their
battlements , or rise only with reversed muskets : they have made a white
flag of napkins ; go beating the chamade , or seeming to beat , for one
can hear nothing . The very Swiss at the Portcullis look weary of firing ;
disheartened in the fire @-@ deluge : a porthole at the drawbridge is opened ,
as by one that would speak . See Huissier Maillard , the shifty man ! On
his plank , swinging over the abyss of that stone @-@ Ditch ; plank resting
on parapet , balanced by weight of Patriots , -- he hovers perilous : such
a Dove towards such an Ark ! Deftly , thou shifty Usher : one man already
fell ; and lies smashed , far down there , against the masonry ! Usher
Maillard falls not : deftly , unerring he walks , with outspread palm . The
Swiss holds a paper through his porthole ; the shifty Usher snatches
it , and returns . Terms of surrender : Pardon , immunity to all ! Are they
accepted ? -- &quot; Foi d &apos;officier , On the word of an officer , &quot; answers half @-@ pay
Hulin , -- or half @-@ pay Elie , for men do not agree on it , &quot; they are ! &quot; Sinks
the drawbridge , -- Usher Maillard bolting it when down ; rushes @-@ in the
living deluge : the Bastille is fallen ! Victoire ! La Bastille est prise !

Chapter 1.5.VII.

Not a Revolt .

Why dwell on what follows ? Hulin &apos;s foi d &apos;officer should have been kept ,
but could not . The Swiss stand drawn up ; disguised in white canvas
smocks ; the Invalides without disguise ; their arms all piled against
the wall . The first rush of victors , in ecstacy that the death @-@ peril is
passed , &apos; leaps joyfully on their necks ; &apos; but new victors rush , and ever
new , also in ecstacy not wholly of joy . As we said , it was a living
deluge , plunging headlong ; had not the Gardes Francaises , in their cool
military way , &apos; wheeled round with arms levelled , &apos; it would have plunged
suicidally , by the hundred or the thousand , into the Bastille @-@ ditch .

And so it goes plunging through court and corridor ; billowing
uncontrollable , firing from windows -- on itself : in hot frenzy of
triumph , of grief and vengeance for its slain . The poor Invalides will
fare ill ; one Swiss , running off in his white smock , is driven back ,
with a death @-@ thrust . Let all prisoners be marched to the Townhall , to be
judged ! -- Alas , already one poor Invalide has his right hand slashed off
him ; his maimed body dragged to the Place de Greve , and hanged there .
This same right hand , it is said , turned back de Launay from the
Powder @-@ Magazine , and saved Paris .

De Launay , &apos; discovered in gray frock with poppy @-@ coloured riband , &apos; is
for killing himself with the sword of his cane . He shall to the
Hotel @-@ de @-@ Ville ; Hulin Maillard and others escorting him ; Elie marching
foremost &apos; with the capitulation @-@ paper on his sword &apos;s point . &apos; Through
roarings and cursings ; through hustlings , clutchings , and at last
through strokes ! Your escort is hustled aside , felled down ; Hulin sinks
exhausted on a heap of stones . Miserable de Launay ! He shall never enter
the Hotel de Ville : only his &apos; bloody hair @-@ queue , held up in a bloody
hand ; &apos; that shall enter , for a sign . The bleeding trunk lies on the
steps there ; the head is off through the streets ; ghastly , aloft on a
pike .

Rigorous de Launay has died ; crying out , &quot; O friends , kill me fast ! &quot;
Merciful de Losme must die ; though Gratitude embraces him , in this
fearful hour , and will die for him ; it avails not . Brothers , your wrath
is cruel ! Your Place de Greve is become a Throat of the Tiger ; full
of mere fierce bellowings , and thirst of blood . One other officer
is massacred ; one other Invalide is hanged on the Lamp @-@ iron : with
difficulty , with generous perseverance , the Gardes Francaises will save
the rest . Provost Flesselles stricken long since with the paleness
of death , must descend from his seat , &apos; to be judged at the Palais
Royal : &apos; -- alas , to be shot dead , by an unknown hand , at the turning of
the first street ! --

O evening sun of July , how , at this hour , thy beams fall slant on
reapers amid peaceful woody fields ; on old women spinning in cottages ;
on ships far out in the silent main ; on Balls at the Orangerie of
Versailles , where high @-@ rouged Dames of the Palace are even now dancing
with double @-@ jacketted Hussar @-@ Officers ; -- and also on this roaring Hell
porch of a Hotel @-@ de @-@ Ville ! Babel Tower , with the confusion of tongues ,
were not Bedlam added with the conflagration of thoughts , was no type
of it . One forest of distracted steel bristles , endless , in front of an
Electoral Committee ; points itself , in horrid radii , against this and
the other accused breast . It was the Titans warring with Olympus ;
and they scarcely crediting it , have conquered : prodigy of prodigies ;
delirious , -- as it could not but be . Denunciation , vengeance ; blaze
of triumph on a dark ground of terror : all outward , all inward things
fallen into one general wreck of madness !

Electoral Committee ? Had it a thousand throats of brass , it would not
suffice . Abbe Lefevre , in the Vaults down below , is black as Vulcan ,
distributing that &apos; five thousand weight of Powder ; &apos; with what perils ,
these eight @-@ and @-@ forty hours ! Last night , a Patriot , in liquor , insisted
on sitting to smoke on the edge of one of the Powder @-@ barrels ; there
smoked he , independent of the world , -- till the Abbe &apos; purchased his pipe
for three francs , &apos; and pitched it far .

Elie , in the grand Hall , Electoral Committee looking on , sits &apos; with
drawn sword bent in three places ; &apos; with battered helm , for he was of
the Queen &apos;s Regiment , Cavalry ; with torn regimentals , face singed and
soiled ; comparable , some think , to &apos; an antique warrior ; &apos; -- judging the
people ; forming a list of Bastille Heroes . O Friends , stain not with
blood the greenest laurels ever gained in this world : such is the burden
of Elie &apos;s song ; could it but be listened to . Courage , Elie ! Courage ,
ye Municipal Electors ! A declining sun ; the need of victuals , and of
telling news , will bring assuagement , dispersion : all earthly things
must end .

Along the streets of Paris circulate Seven Bastille Prisoners , borne
shoulder @-@ high : seven Heads on pikes ; the Keys of the Bastille ; and much
else . See also the Garde Francaises , in their steadfast military way ,
marching home to their barracks , with the Invalides and Swiss kindly
enclosed in hollow square . It is one year and two months since these
same men stood unparticipating , with Brennus d &apos;Agoust at the Palais
de Justice , when Fate overtook d &apos;Espremenil ; and now they have
participated ; and will participate . Not Gardes Francaises henceforth ,
but Centre Grenadiers of the National Guard : men of iron discipline and
humour , -- not without a kind of thought in them !

Likewise ashlar stones of the Bastille continue thundering through the
dusk ; its paper @-@ archives shall fly white . Old secrets come to view ; and
long @-@ buried Despair finds voice . Read this portion of an old Letter :
( Dated , a la Bastille , 7 Octobre , 1752 ; signed Queret @-@ Demery . Bastille
Devoilee , in Linguet , Memoires sur la Bastille ( Paris , 1821 ) , p . 199 . )
&apos;If for my consolation Monseigneur would grant me for the sake of God
and the Most Blessed Trinity , that I could have news of my dear wife ;
were it only her name on card to shew that she is alive ! It were the
greatest consolation I could receive ; and I should for ever bless the
greatness of Monseigneur . &apos; Poor Prisoner , who namest thyself Queret
Demery , and hast no other history , -- she is dead , that dear wife of
thine , and thou art dead ! &apos; Tis fifty years since thy breaking heart put
this question ; to be heard now first , and long heard , in the hearts of
men .

But so does the July twilight thicken ; so must Paris , as sick children ,
and all distracted creatures do , brawl itself finally into a kind
of sleep . Municipal Electors , astonished to find their heads still
uppermost , are home : only Moreau de Saint @-@ Mery of tropical birth and
heart , of coolest judgment ; he , with two others , shall sit permanent at
the Townhall . Paris sleeps ; gleams upward the illuminated City : patrols
go clashing , without common watchword ; there go rumours ; alarms of
war , to the extent of &apos; fifteen thousand men marching through the
Suburb Saint @-@ Antoine , &apos; -- who never got it marched through . Of the day &apos;s
distraction judge by this of the night : Moreau de Saint @-@ Mery , &apos; before
rising from his seat , gave upwards of three thousand orders . &apos; ( Dusaulx . )
What a head ; comparable to Friar Bacon &apos;s Brass Head ! Within it lies all
Paris . Prompt must the answer be , right or wrong ; in Paris is no other
Authority extant . Seriously , a most cool clear head ; -- for which also
thou O brave Saint @-@ Mery , in many capacities , from august Senator to
Merchant &apos;s @-@ Clerk , Book @-@ dealer , Vice @-@ King ; in many places , from Virginia
to Sardinia , shalt , ever as a brave man , find employment . ( Biographie
Universelle , para Moreau Saint @-@ Mery ( by Fournier @-@ Pescay ) . )

Besenval has decamped , under cloud of dusk , &apos; amid a great affluence of
people , &apos; who did not harm him ; he marches , with faint @-@ growing tread ,
down the left bank of the Seine , all night , -- towards infinite space .
Resummoned shall Besenval himself be ; for trial , for difficult
acquittal . His King &apos;s @-@ troops , his Royal Allemand , are gone hence for
ever .

The Versailles Ball and lemonade is done ; the Orangery is silent except
for nightbirds . Over in the Salle des Menus , Vice @-@ president Lafayette ,
with unsnuffed lights , &apos; with some hundred of members , stretched on
tables round him , &apos; sits erect ; outwatching the Bear . This day , a second
solemn Deputation went to his Majesty ; a second , and then a third : with
no effect . What will the end of these things be ?

In the Court , all is mystery , not without whisperings of terror ; though
ye dream of lemonade and epaulettes , ye foolish women ! His Majesty , kept
in happy ignorance , perhaps dreams of double @-@ barrels and the Woods of
Meudon . Late at night , the Duke de Liancourt , having official right of
entrance , gains access to the Royal Apartments ; unfolds , with earnest
clearness , in his constitutional way , the Job &apos;s @-@ news . &quot; Mais , &quot; said poor
Louis , &quot; c &apos;est une revolte , Why , that is a revolt ! &quot; -- &quot; Sire , &quot; answered
Liancourt , &quot; It is not a revolt , it is a revolution . &quot;



Chapter 1.5.VIII.

Conquering your King .

On the morrow a fourth Deputation to the Chateau is on foot : of a
more solemn , not to say awful character , for , besides &apos; orgies in the
Orangery , &apos; it seems , &apos; the grain convoys are all stopped ; &apos; nor has
Mirabeau &apos;s thunder been silent . Such Deputation is on the point of
setting out -- when lo , his Majesty himself attended only by his two
Brothers , step in ; quite in the paternal manner ; announces that the
troops , and all causes of offence , are gone , and henceforth there shall
be nothing but trust , reconcilement , good @-@ will ; whereof he &apos; permits
and even requests , &apos; a National Assembly to assure Paris in his name !
Acclamation , as of men suddenly delivered from death , gives answer .
The whole Assembly spontaneously rises to escort his Majesty back ;
&apos;interlacing their arms to keep off the excessive pressure from him ; &apos;
for all Versailles is crowding and shouting . The Chateau Musicians , with
a felicitous promptitude , strike up the Sein de sa Famille ( Bosom of
one &apos;s Family ) : the Queen appears at the balcony with her little boy
and girl , &apos; kissing them several times ; &apos; infinite Vivats spread far and
wide ; -- and suddenly there has come , as it were , a new Heaven @-@ on @-@ Earth .

Eighty @-@ eight august Senators , Bailly , Lafayette , and our repentant
Archbishop among them , take coach for Paris , with the great
intelligence ; benedictions without end on their heads . From the Place
Louis Quinze , where they alight , all the way to the Hotel @-@ de @-@ Ville , it
is one sea of Tricolor cockades , of clear National muskets ; one
tempest of huzzaings , hand @-@ clappings , aided by &apos; occasional rollings &apos; of
drum @-@ music . Harangues of due fervour are delivered ; especially by Lally
Tollendal , pious son of the ill @-@ fated murdered Lally ; on whose head ,
in consequence , a civic crown ( of oak or parsley ) is forced , -- which he
forcibly transfers to Bailly &apos;s .

But surely , for one thing , the National Guard must have a General !
Moreau de Saint @-@ Mery , he of the &apos; three thousand orders , &apos; casts one of
his significant glances on the Bust of Lafayette , which has stood there
ever since the American War of Liberty . Whereupon , by acclamation ,
Lafayette is nominated . Again , in room of the slain traitor or
quasi @-@ traitor Flesselles , President Bailly shall be -- Provost of the
Merchants ? No : Mayor of Paris ! So be it . Maire de Paris ! Mayor
Bailly , General Lafayette ; vive Bailly , vive Lafayette -- the universal
out @-@ of @-@ doors multitude rends the welkin in confirmation . -- And now ,
finally , let us to Notre @-@ Dame for a Te Deum .

Towards Notre @-@ Dame Cathedral , in glad procession , these Regenerators of
the Country walk , through a jubilant people ; in fraternal manner ; Abbe
Lefevre , still black with his gunpowder services , walking arm in arm
with the white @-@ stoled Archbishop . Poor Bailly comes upon the Foundling
Children , sent to kneel to him ; and &apos; weeps . &apos; Te Deum , our Archbishop
officiating , is not only sung , but shot -- with blank cartridges . Our
joy is boundless as our wo threatened to be . Paris , by her own pike
and musket , and the valour of her own heart , has conquered the very
wargods , -- to the satisfaction now of Majesty itself . A courier is , this
night , getting under way for Necker : the People &apos;s Minister , invited back
by King , by National Assembly , and Nation , shall traverse France amid
shoutings , and the sound of trumpet and timbrel .

Seeing which course of things , Messeigneurs of the Court Triumvirate ,
Messieurs of the dead @-@ born Broglie @-@ Ministry , and others such , consider
that their part also is clear : to mount and ride . Off , ye too @-@ loyal
Broglies , Polignacs , and Princes of the Blood ; off while it is yet time !
Did not the Palais @-@ Royal in its late nocturnal &apos; violent motions , &apos; set
a specific price ( place of payment not mentioned ) on each of your
heads ? -- With precautions , with the aid of pieces of cannon and regiments
that can be depended on , Messeigneurs , between the 16th night and the
17th morning , get to their several roads . Not without risk ! Prince Conde
has ( or seems to have ) &apos; men galloping at full speed ; &apos; with a view , it
is thought , to fling him into the river Oise , at Pont @-@ Sainte @-@ Mayence .
( Weber , ii . 126 . ) The Polignacs travel disguised ; friends , not servants ,
on their coach @-@ box . Broglie has his own difficulties at Versailles ,
runs his own risks at Metz and Verdun ; does nevertheless get safe to
Luxemburg , and there rests .

This is what they call the First Emigration ; determined on , as appears ,
in full Court @-@ conclave ; his Majesty assisting ; prompt he , for his share
of it , to follow any counsel whatsoever . &apos; Three Sons of France , and
four Princes of the blood of Saint Louis , &apos; says Weber , &apos; could not more
effectually humble the Burghers of Paris &apos; than by appearing to withdraw
in fear of their life . &apos; Alas , the Burghers of Paris bear it with
unexpected Stoicism ! The Man d &apos;Artois indeed is gone ; but has he
carried , for example , the Land D &apos;Artois with him ? Not even Bagatelle the
Country @-@ house ( which shall be useful as a Tavern ) ; hardly the four @-@ valet
Breeches , leaving the Breeches @-@ maker ! -- As for old Foulon , one learns
that he is dead ; at least a &apos; sumptuous funeral &apos; is going on ; the
undertakers honouring him , if no other will . Intendant Berthier , his
son @-@ in @-@ law , is still living ; lurking : he joined Besenval , on that
Eumenides &apos; Sunday ; appearing to treat it with levity ; and is now fled no
man knows whither .

The Emigration is not gone many miles , Prince Conde hardly across the
Oise , when his Majesty , according to arrangement , for the Emigration
also thought it might do good , -- undertakes a rather daring enterprise :
that of visiting Paris in person . With a Hundred Members of Assembly ;
with small or no military escort , which indeed he dismissed at the
Bridge of Sevres , poor Louis sets out ; leaving a desolate Palace ; a
Queen weeping , the Present , the Past , and the Future all so unfriendly
for her .

At the Barrier of Passy , Mayor Bailly , in grand gala , presents him with
the keys ; harangues him , in Academic style ; mentions that it is a great
day ; that in Henri Quatre &apos;s case , the King had to make conquest of his
People , but in this happier case , the People makes conquest of its King
( a conquis son Roi ) . The King , so happily conquered , drives forward ,
slowly , through a steel people , all silent , or shouting only Vive la
Nation ; is harangued at the Townhall , by Moreau of the three @-@ thousand
orders , by King &apos;s Procureur M. Ethys de Corny , by Lally Tollendal , and
others ; knows not what to think of it , or say of it ; learns that he is
&apos;Restorer of French Liberty , &apos; -- as a Statue of him , to be raised on the
site of the Bastille , shall testify to all men . Finally , he is shewn at
the Balcony , with a Tricolor cockade in his hat ; is greeted now , with
vehement acclamation , from Square and Street , from all windows and
roofs : -- and so drives home again amid glad mingled and , as it were ,
intermarried shouts , of Vive le Roi and Vive la Nation ; wearied but
safe .

It was Sunday when the red @-@ hot balls hung over us , in mid air : it is
now but Friday , and &apos; the Revolution is sanctioned . &apos; An August National
Assembly shall make the Constitution ; and neither foreign Pandour ,
domestic Triumvirate , with levelled Cannon , Guy @-@ Faux powder @-@ plots ( for
that too was spoken of ) ; nor any tyrannic Power on the Earth , or under
the Earth , shall say to it , What dost thou ? -- So jubilates the people ;
sure now of a Constitution . Cracked Marquis Saint @-@ Huruge is heard
under the windows of the Chateau ; murmuring sheer speculative @-@ treason .
( Campan , ii . 46 @-@ 64 . )



Chapter 1.5.IX.

The Lanterne .

The Fall of the Bastille may be said to have shaken all France to the
deepest foundations of its existence . The rumour of these wonders flies
every where : with the natural speed of Rumour ; with an effect thought
to be preternatural , produced by plots . Did d &apos;Orleans or Laclos , nay did
Mirabeau ( not overburdened with money at this time ) send riding Couriers
out from Paris ; to gallop &apos; on all radii , &apos; or highways , towards all
points of France ? It is a miracle , which no penetrating man will call in
question . ( Toulongeon , ( i . 95 ) ; Weber , &amp; c . &amp; c . )

Already in most Towns , Electoral Committees were met ; to regret Necker ,
in harangue and resolution . In many a Town , as Rennes , Caen , Lyons , an
ebullient people was already regretting him in brickbats and musketry .
But now , at every Town &apos;s @-@ end in France , there do arrive , in these days
of terror , -- &apos; men , &apos; as men will arrive ; nay , &apos; men on horseback , &apos;
since Rumour oftenest travels riding . These men declare , with alarmed
countenance , The BRIGANDS to be coming , to be just at hand ; and do
then -- ride on , about their further business , be what it might ! Whereupon
the whole population of such Town , defensively flies to arms . Petition
is soon thereafter forwarded to National Assembly ; in such peril and
terror of peril , leave to organise yourself cannot be withheld : the
armed population becomes everywhere an enrolled National Guard . Thus
rides Rumour , careering along all radii , from Paris outwards , to such
purpose : in few days , some say in not many hours , all France to
the utmost borders bristles with bayonets . Singular , but
undeniable , -- miraculous or not ! -- But thus may any chemical liquid ;
though cooled to the freezing @-@ point , or far lower , still continue
liquid ; and then , on the slightest stroke or shake , it at once rushes
wholly into ice . Thus has France , for long months and even years , been
chemically dealt with ; brought below zero ; and now , shaken by the Fall
of a Bastille , it instantaneously congeals : into one crystallised mass ,
of sharp @-@ cutting steel ! Guai a chi la tocca ; &apos; Ware who touches it !

In Paris , an Electoral Committee , with a new Mayor and General , is
urgent with belligerent workmen to resume their handicrafts . Strong
Dames of the Market ( Dames de la Halle ) deliver congratulatory
harangues ; present &apos; bouquets to the Shrine of Sainte Genevieve . &apos; 
Unenrolled men deposit their arms , -- not so readily as could be wished ;
and receive &apos; nine francs . &apos; With Te Deums , Royal Visits , and sanctioned
Revolution , there is halcyon weather ; weather even of preternatural
brightness ; the hurricane being overblown .

Nevertheless , as is natural , the waves still run high , hollow rocks
retaining their murmur . We are but at the 22nd of the month , hardly
above a week since the Bastille fell , when it suddenly appears that old
Foulon is alive ; nay , that he is here , in early morning , in the streets
of Paris ; the extortioner , the plotter , who would make the people eat
grass , and was a liar from the beginning ! -- It is even so . The deceptive
&apos;sumptuous funeral &apos; ( of some domestic that died ) ; the hiding @-@ place at
Vitry towards Fontainbleau , have not availed that wretched old man . Some
living domestic or dependant , for none loves Foulon , has betrayed him to
the Village . Merciless boors of Vitry unearth him ; pounce on him ,
like hell @-@ hounds : Westward , old Infamy ; to Paris , to be judged at the
Hotel @-@ de @-@ Ville ! His old head , which seventy @-@ four years have bleached ,
is bare ; they have tied an emblematic bundle of grass on his back ; a
garland of nettles and thistles is round his neck : in this manner ; led
with ropes ; goaded on with curses and menaces , must he , with his old
limbs , sprawl forward ; the pitiablest , most unpitied of all old men .

Sooty Saint @-@ Antoine , and every street , mustering its crowds as he
passes , -- the Place de Greve , the Hall of the Hotel @-@ de @-@ Ville will
scarcely hold his escort and him . Foulon must not only be judged
righteously ; but judged there where he stands , without any delay .
Appoint seven judges , ye Municipals , or seventy @-@ and @-@ seven ; name
them yourselves , or we will name them : but judge him ! ( Histoire
Parlementaire , ii . 146 @-@ 9 . ) Electoral rhetoric , eloquence of Mayor
Bailly , is wasted explaining the beauty of the Law &apos;s delay . Delay , and
still delay ! Behold , O Mayor of the People , the morning has worn itself
into noon ; and he is still unjudged ! -- Lafayette , pressingly sent for ,
arrives ; gives voice : This Foulon , a known man , is guilty almost beyond
doubt ; but may he not have accomplices ? Ought not the truth to be
cunningly pumped out of him , -- in the Abbaye Prison ? It is a new light !
Sansculottism claps hands ; -- at which hand @-@ clapping , Foulon ( in
his fainness , as his Destiny would have it ) also claps . &quot; See ! they
understand one another ! &quot; cries dark Sansculottism , blazing into fury
of suspicion . -- &quot; Friends , &quot; said &apos; a person in good clothes , &apos; stepping
forward , &quot; what is the use of judging this man ? Has he not been judged
these thirty years ? &quot; With wild yells , Sansculottism clutches him , in
its hundred hands : he is whirled across the Place de Greve , to the
&apos;Lanterne , &apos; Lamp @-@ iron which there is at the corner of the Rue de la
Vannerie ; pleading bitterly for life , -- to the deaf winds . Only with the
third rope ( for two ropes broke , and the quavering voice still pleaded ) ,
can he be so much as got hanged ! His Body is dragged through the
streets ; his Head goes aloft on a pike , the mouth filled with grass :
amid sounds as of Tophet , from a grass @-@ eating people . ( Deux Amis de la
Liberte , ii . 60 @-@ 6 . )

Surely if Revenge is a &apos; kind of Justice , &apos; it is a &apos; wild &apos; kind ! O mad
Sansculottism hast thou risen , in thy mad darkness , in thy soot and
rags ; unexpectedly , like an Enceladus , living @-@ buried , from under his
Trinacria ? They that would make grass be eaten do now eat grass , in
this manner ? After long dumb @-@ groaning generations , has the turn suddenly
become thine ? -- To such abysmal overturns , and frightful instantaneous
inversions of the centre @-@ of @-@ gravity , are human Solecisms all liable ,
if they but knew it ; the more liable , the falser ( and topheavier ) they
are ! --

To add to the horror of Mayor Bailly and his Municipals , word comes
that Berthier has also been arrested ; that he is on his way hither from
Compiegne . Berthier , Intendant ( say , Tax @-@ levier ) of Paris ; sycophant
and tyrant ; forestaller of Corn ; contriver of Camps against the
people ; -- accused of many things : is he not Foulon &apos;s son @-@ in @-@ law ; and , in
that one point , guilty of all ? In these hours too , when Sansculottism
has its blood up ! The shuddering Municipals send one of their number to
escort him , with mounted National Guards .

At the fall of day , the wretched Berthier , still wearing a face of
courage , arrives at the Barrier ; in an open carriage ; with the Municipal
beside him ; five hundred horsemen with drawn sabres ; unarmed footmen
enough , not without noise ! Placards go brandished round him ; bearing
legibly his indictment , as Sansculottism , with unlegal brevity , &apos; in huge
letters , &apos; draws it up . ( &apos; Il a vole le Roi et la France ( He robbed the
King and France ) . &apos; &apos; He devoured the substance of the People . &apos; &apos; He was
the slave of the rich , and the tyrant of the poor . &apos; &apos; He drank the blood
of the widow and orphan . &apos; &apos; He betrayed his country . &apos; See Deux Amis ,
ii . 67 @-@ 73 . ) Paris is come forth to meet him : with hand @-@ clappings , with
windows flung up ; with dances , triumph @-@ songs , as of the Furies ! Lastly
the Head of Foulon : this also meets him on a pike . Well might his &apos; look
become glazed , &apos; and sense fail him , at such sight ! -- Nevertheless , be
the man &apos;s conscience what it may , his nerves are of iron . At the
Hotel @-@ de @-@ Ville , he will answer nothing . He says , he obeyed superior
order ; they have his papers ; they may judge and determine : as for
himself , not having closed an eye these two nights , he demands , before
all things , to have sleep . Leaden sleep , thou miserable Berthier ! Guards
rise with him , in motion towards the Abbaye . At the very door of the
Hotel @-@ de @-@ Ville , they are clutched ; flung asunder , as by a vortex of mad
arms ; Berthier whirls towards the Lanterne . He snatches a musket ; fells
and strikes , defending himself like a mad lion ; is borne down , trampled ,
hanged , mangled : his Head too , and even his Heart , flies over the City
on a pike .

Horrible , in Lands that had known equal justice ! Not so unnatural in
Lands that had never known it . Le sang qui coule est @-@ il donc si pure ?
asks Barnave ; intimating that the Gallows , though by irregular methods ,
has its own . -- Thou thyself , O Reader , when thou turnest that corner of
the Rue de la Vannerie , and discernest still that same grim Bracket
of old Iron , wilt not want for reflections . &apos; Over a grocer &apos;s shop , &apos; or
otherwise ; with &apos; a bust of Louis XIV. in the niche under it , &apos; or now
no longer in the niche , -- it still sticks there : still holding out an
ineffectual light , of fish @-@ oil ; and has seen worlds wrecked , and says
nothing .

But to the eye of enlightened Patriotism , what a thunder @-@ cloud was this ;
suddenly shaping itself in the radiance of the halcyon weather ! Cloud
of Erebus blackness : betokening latent electricity without limit . Mayor
Bailly , General Lafayette throw up their commissions , in an indignant
manner ; -- need to be flattered back again . The cloud disappears , as
thunder @-@ clouds do . The halcyon weather returns , though of a grayer
complexion ; of a character more and more evidently not supernatural .

Thus , in any case , with what rubs soever , shall the Bastille be
abolished from our Earth ; and with it , Feudalism , Despotism ; and , one
hopes , Scoundrelism generally , and all hard usage of man by his brother
man . Alas , the Scoundrelism and hard usage are not so easy of abolition !
But as for the Bastille , it sinks day after day , and month after month ;
its ashlars and boulders tumbling down continually , by express order of
our Municipals . Crowds of the curious roam through its caverns ; gaze on
the skeletons found walled up , on the oubliettes , iron cages , monstrous
stone @-@ blocks with padlock chains . One day we discern Mirabeau there ;
along with the Genevese Dumont . ( Dumont , Souvenirs sur Mirabeau , p .
305 . ) Workers and onlookers make reverent way for him ; fling verses ,
flowers on his path , Bastille @-@ papers and curiosities into his carriage ,
with vivats .

Able Editors compile Books from the Bastille Archives ; from what of them
remain unburnt . The Key of that Robber @-@ Den shall cross the Atlantic ;
shall lie on Washington &apos;s hall @-@ table . The great Clock ticks now in a
private patriotic Clockmaker &apos;s apartment ; no longer measuring hours of
mere heaviness . Vanished is the Bastille , what we call vanished :
the body , or sandstones , of it hanging , in benign metamorphosis , for
centuries to come , over the Seine waters , as Pont Louis Seize ; ( Dulaure :
Histoire de Paris , viii . 434 . ) the soul of it living , perhaps still
longer , in the memories of men .

So far , ye august Senators , with your Tennis @-@ Court Oaths , your inertia
and impetus , your sagacity and pertinacity , have ye brought us . &quot; And
yet think , Messieurs , &quot; as the Petitioner justly urged , &quot; you who were our
saviours , did yourselves need saviours , &quot; -- the brave Bastillers , namely ;
workmen of Paris ; many of them in straightened pecuniary circumstances !
( Moniteur : Seance du Samedi 18 Juillet 1789 in Histoire Parlementaire ,
ii . 137 . ) Subscriptions are opened ; Lists are formed , more accurate than
Elie &apos;s ; harangues are delivered . A Body of Bastille Heroes , tolerably
complete , did get together ; -- comparable to the Argonauts ; hoping to
endure like them . But in little more than a year , the whirlpool
of things threw them asunder again , and they sank . So many highest
superlatives achieved by man are followed by new higher ; and dwindle
into comparatives and positives ! The Siege of the Bastille , weighed with
which , in the Historical balance , most other sieges , including that
of Troy Town , are gossamer , cost , as we find , in killed and mortally
wounded , on the part of the Besiegers , some Eighty @-@ three persons : on the
part of the Besieged , after all that straw @-@ burning , fire @-@ pumping ,
and deluge of musketry , One poor solitary invalid , shot stone @-@ dead
( roide @-@ mort ) on the battlements ; ( Dusaulx : Prise de la Bastille , p . 447,
&amp; c . ) The Bastille Fortress , like the City of Jericho , was overturned by
miraculous sound .




BOOK VI .

CONSOLIDATION


Chapter 1.6.I.

Make the Constitution .

Here perhaps is the place to fix , a little more precisely , what these
two words , French Revolution , shall mean ; for , strictly considered , they
may have as many meanings as there are speakers of them . All things are
in revolution ; in change from moment to moment , which becomes sensible
from epoch to epoch : in this Time @-@ World of ours there is properly
nothing else but revolution and mutation , and even nothing else
conceivable . Revolution , you answer , means speedier change . Whereupon
one has still to ask : How speedy ? At what degree of speed ; in what
particular points of this variable course , which varies in velocity , but
can never stop till Time itself stops , does revolution begin and end ;
cease to be ordinary mutation , and again become such ? It is a thing that
will depend on definition more or less arbitrary .

For ourselves we answer that French Revolution means here the open
violent Rebellion , and Victory , of disimprisoned Anarchy against corrupt
worn @-@ out Authority : how Anarchy breaks prison ; bursts up from the
infinite Deep , and rages uncontrollable , immeasurable , enveloping a
world ; in phasis after phasis of fever @-@ frenzy ; -- &apos; till the frenzy burning
itself out , and what elements of new Order it held ( since all Force
holds such ) developing themselves , the Uncontrollable be got , if not
reimprisoned , yet harnessed , and its mad forces made to work towards
their object as sane regulated ones . For as Hierarchies and Dynasties
of all kinds , Theocracies , Aristocracies , Autocracies , Strumpetocracies ,
have ruled over the world ; so it was appointed , in the decrees
of Providence , that this same Victorious Anarchy , Jacobinism ,
Sansculottism , French Revolution , Horrors of French Revolution , or what
else mortals name it , should have its turn . The &apos; destructive wrath&apos;
of Sansculottism : this is what we speak , having unhappily no voice for
singing .

Surely a great Phenomenon : nay it is a transcendental one , overstepping
all rules and experience ; the crowning Phenomenon of our Modern Time .
For here again , most unexpectedly , comes antique Fanaticism in new and
newest vesture ; miraculous , as all Fanaticism is . Call it the Fanaticism
of &apos; making away with formulas , de humer les formulas . &apos; The world
of formulas , the formed regulated world , which all habitable world
is , -- must needs hate such Fanaticism like death ; and be at deadly
variance with it . The world of formulas must conquer it ; or failing
that , must die execrating it , anathematising it ; -- can nevertheless in
nowise prevent its being and its having been . The Anathemas are there ,
and the miraculous Thing is there .

Whence it cometh ? Whither it goeth ? These are questions ! When the age
of Miracles lay faded into the distance as an incredible tradition , and
even the age of Conventionalities was now old ; and Man &apos;s Existence had
for long generations rested on mere formulas which were grown hollow by
course of time ; and it seemed as if no Reality any longer existed but
only Phantasms of realities , and God &apos;s Universe were the work of the
Tailor and Upholsterer mainly , and men were buckram masks that went
about becking and grimacing there , -- on a sudden , the Earth yawns
asunder , and amid Tartarean smoke , and glare of fierce brightness , rises
SANSCULOTTISM , many @-@ headed , fire @-@ breathing , and asks : What think ye
of me ? Well may the buckram masks start together , terror @-@ struck ;
&apos;into expressive well @-@ concerted groups ! &apos; It is indeed , Friends , a most
singular , most fatal thing . Let whosoever is but buckram and a phantasm
look to it : ill verily may it fare with him ; here methinks he cannot
much longer be . Wo also to many a one who is not wholly buckram , but
partially real and human ! The age of Miracles has come back ! &apos; Behold
the World @-@ Phoenix , in fire @-@ consummation and fire @-@ creation ; wide are her
fanning wings ; loud is her death @-@ melody , of battle @-@ thunders and falling
towns ; skyward lashes the funeral flame , enveloping all things : it is
the Death @-@ Birth of a World ! &apos;

Whereby , however , as we often say , shall one unspeakable blessing
seem attainable . This , namely : that Man and his Life rest no more on
hollowness and a Lie , but on solidity and some kind of Truth . Welcome ,
the beggarliest truth , so it be one , in exchange for the royallest sham !
Truth of any kind breeds ever new and better truth ; thus hard granite
rock will crumble down into soil , under the blessed skyey influences ;
and cover itself with verdure , with fruitage and umbrage . But as for
Falsehood , which in like contrary manner , grows ever falser , -- what can
it , or what should it do but decease , being ripe ; decompose itself ,
gently or even violently , and return to the Father of it , -- too probably
in flames of fire ?

Sansculottism will burn much ; but what is incombustible it will
not burn . Fear not Sansculottism ; recognise it for what it is , the
portentous , inevitable end of much , the miraculous beginning of much .
One other thing thou mayest understand of it : that it too came from
God ; for has it not been ? From of old , as it is written , are His goings
forth ; in the great Deep of things ; fearful and wonderful now as in the
beginning : in the whirlwind also He speaks ! and the wrath of men is made
to praise Him . -- But to gauge and measure this immeasurable Thing , and
what is called account for it , and reduce it to a dead logic @-@ formula ,
attempt not ! Much less shalt thou shriek thyself hoarse , cursing it ;
for that , to all needful lengths , has been already done . As an actually
existing Son of Time , look , with unspeakable manifold interest , oftenest
in silence , at what the Time did bring : therewith edify , instruct ,
nourish thyself , or were it but to amuse and gratify thyself , as it is
given thee .

Another question which at every new turn will rise on us , requiring
ever new reply is this : Where the French Revolution specially is ? In
the King &apos;s Palace , in his Majesty &apos;s or her Majesty &apos;s managements , and
maltreatments , cabals , imbecilities and woes , answer some few : -- whom we
do not answer . In the National Assembly , answer a large mixed multitude :
who accordingly seat themselves in the Reporter &apos;s Chair ; and therefrom
noting what Proclamations , Acts , Reports , passages of logic @-@ fence ,
bursts of parliamentary eloquence seem notable within doors , and what
tumults and rumours of tumult become audible from without , -- produce
volume on volume ; and , naming it History of the French Revolution ,
contentedly publish the same . To do the like , to almost any extent , with
so many Filed Newspapers , Choix des Rapports , Histoires Parlementaires
as there are , amounting to many horseloads , were easy for us . Easy but
unprofitable . The National Assembly , named now Constituent Assembly ,
goes its course ; making the Constitution ; but the French Revolution also
goes its course .

In general , may we not say that the French Revolution lies in the heart
and head of every violent @-@ speaking , of every violent @-@ thinking
French Man ? How the Twenty @-@ five Millions of such , in their perplexed
combination , acting and counter @-@ acting may give birth to events ; which
event successively is the cardinal one ; and from what point of vision it
may best be surveyed : this is a problem . Which problem the best insight ,
seeking light from all possible sources , shifting its point of vision
whithersoever vision or glimpse of vision can be had , may employ itself
in solving ; and be well content to solve in some tolerably approximate
way .

As to the National Assembly , in so far as it still towers eminent over
France , after the manner of a car @-@ borne Carroccio , though now no longer
in the van ; and rings signals for retreat or for advance , -- it is and
continues a reality among other realities . But in so far as it sits
making the Constitution , on the other hand , it is a fatuity and chimera
mainly . Alas , in the never so heroic building of Montesquieu @-@ Mably
card @-@ castles , though shouted over by the world , what interest is there ?
Occupied in that way , an august National Assembly becomes for us little
other than a Sanhedrim of pedants , not of the gerund @-@ grinding , yet of no
fruitfuller sort ; and its loud debatings and recriminations about Rights
of Man , Right of Peace and War , Veto suspensif , Veto absolu , what are
they but so many Pedant &apos;s @-@ curses , &apos; May God confound you for your Theory
of Irregular Verbs ! &apos;

A Constitution can be built , Constitutions enough a la Sieyes : but the
frightful difficulty is that of getting men to come and live in them !
Could Sieyes have drawn thunder and lightning out of Heaven to sanction
his Constitution , it had been well : but without any thunder ? Nay ,
strictly considered , is it not still true that without some such
celestial sanction , given visibly in thunder or invisibly otherwise , no
Constitution can in the long run be worth much more than the waste @-@ paper
it is written on ? The Constitution , the set of Laws , or prescribed
Habits of Acting , that men will live under , is the one which images
their Convictions , -- their Faith as to this wondrous Universe , and what
rights , duties , capabilities they have there ; which stands sanctioned
therefore , by Necessity itself , if not by a seen Deity , then by an
unseen one . Other laws , whereof there are always enough ready @-@ made , are
usurpations ; which men do not obey , but rebel against , and abolish , by
their earliest convenience .

The question of questions accordingly were , Who is it that especially
for rebellers and abolishers , can make a Constitution ? He that can image
forth the general Belief when there is one ; that can impart one when ,
as here , there is none . A most rare man ; ever as of old a god @-@ missioned
man ! Here , however , in defect of such transcendent supreme man , Time
with its infinite succession of merely superior men , each yielding his
little contribution , does much . Force likewise ( for , as Antiquarian
Philosophers teach , the royal Sceptre was from the first something of
a Hammer , to crack such heads as could not be convinced ) will all along
find somewhat to do . And thus in perpetual abolition and reparation ,
rending and mending , with struggle and strife , with present evil and the
hope and effort towards future good , must the Constitution , as all human
things do , build itself forward ; or unbuild itself , and sink , as it
can and may . O Sieyes , and ye other Committeemen , and Twelve Hundred
miscellaneous individuals from all parts of France ! What is the Belief
of France , and yours , if ye knew it ? Properly that there shall be no
Belief ; that all formulas be swallowed . The Constitution which will suit
that ? Alas , too clearly , a No @-@ Constitution , an Anarchy ; -- which also , in
due season , shall be vouchsafed you .

But , after all , what can an unfortunate National Assembly do ? Consider
only this , that there are Twelve Hundred miscellaneous individuals ;
not a unit of whom but has his own thinking @-@ apparatus , his own
speaking @-@ apparatus ! In every unit of them is some belief and wish ,
different for each , both that France should be regenerated , and also
that he individually should do it . Twelve Hundred separate Forces , yoked
miscellaneously to any object , miscellaneously to all sides of it ; and
bid pull for life !

Or is it the nature of National Assemblies generally to do , with endless
labour and clangour , Nothing ? Are Representative Governments mostly
at bottom Tyrannies too ! Shall we say , the Tyrants , the ambitious
contentious Persons , from all corners of the country do , in this manner ,
get gathered into one place ; and there , with motion and counter @-@ motion ,
with jargon and hubbub , cancel one another , like the fabulous Kilkenny
Cats ; and produce , for net @-@ result , zero ; -- the country meanwhile
governing or guiding itself , by such wisdom , recognised or for most part
unrecognised , as may exist in individual heads here and there ? -- Nay ,
even that were a great improvement : for , of old , with their Guelf
Factions and Ghibelline Factions , with their Red Roses and White Roses ,
they were wont to cancel the whole country as well . Besides they do it
now in a much narrower cockpit ; within the four walls of their Assembly
House , and here and there an outpost of Hustings and Barrel @-@ heads ; do it
with tongues too , not with swords : -- all which improvements , in the art
of producing zero , are they not great ? Nay , best of all , some happy
Continents ( as the Western one , with its Savannahs , where whosoever has
four willing limbs finds food under his feet , and an infinite sky over
his head ) can do without governing . -- What Sphinx @-@ questions ; which the
distracted world , in these very generations , must answer or die !



Chapter 1.6.II.

The Constituent Assembly .

One thing an elected Assembly of Twelve Hundred is fit for : Destroying .
Which indeed is but a more decided exercise of its natural talent for
Doing Nothing . Do nothing , only keep agitating , debating ; and things
will destroy themselves .

So and not otherwise proved it with an august National Assembly . It
took the name , Constituent , as if its mission and function had been to
construct or build ; which also , with its whole soul , it endeavoured
to do : yet , in the fates , in the nature of things , there lay for it
precisely of all functions the most opposite to that . Singular , what
Gospels men will believe ; even Gospels according to Jean Jacques ! It
was the fixed Faith of these National Deputies , as of all thinking
Frenchmen , that the Constitution could be made ; that they , there and
then , were called to make it . How , with the toughness of Old Hebrews or
Ishmaelite Moslem , did the otherwise light unbelieving People persist in
this their Credo quia impossibile ; and front the armed world with
it ; and grow fanatic , and even heroic , and do exploits by it ! The
Constituent Assembly &apos;s Constitution , and several others , will , being
printed and not manuscript , survive to future generations , as an
instructive well @-@ nigh incredible document of the Time : the most
significant Picture of the then existing France ; or at lowest , Picture
of these men &apos;s Picture of it .

But in truth and seriousness , what could the National Assembly have
done ? The thing to be done was , actually as they said , to regenerate
France ; to abolish the old France , and make a new one ; quietly or
forcibly , by concession or by violence , this , by the Law of Nature , has
become inevitable . With what degree of violence , depends on the wisdom
of those that preside over it . With perfect wisdom on the part of the
National Assembly , it had all been otherwise ; but whether , in any wise ,
it could have been pacific , nay other than bloody and convulsive , may
still be a question .

Grant , meanwhile , that this Constituent Assembly does to the last
continue to be something . With a sigh , it sees itself incessantly
forced away from its infinite divine task , of perfecting &apos; the Theory of
Irregular Verbs , &apos; -- to finite terrestrial tasks , which latter have still
a significance for us . It is the cynosure of revolutionary France , this
National Assembly . All work of Government has fallen into its hands ,
or under its control ; all men look to it for guidance . In the middle
of that huge Revolt of Twenty @-@ five millions , it hovers always aloft
as Carroccio or Battle @-@ Standard , impelling and impelled , in the most
confused way ; if it cannot give much guidance , it will still seem to
give some . It emits pacificatory Proclamations , not a few ; with more or
with less result . It authorises the enrolment of National Guards , -- lest
Brigands come to devour us , and reap the unripe crops . It sends missions
to quell &apos; effervescences ; &apos; to deliver men from the Lanterne . It can
listen to congratulatory Addresses , which arrive daily by the sackful ;
mostly in King Cambyses &apos; vein : also to Petitions and complaints from all
mortals ; so that every mortal &apos;s complaint , if it cannot get redressed ,
may at least hear itself complain . For the rest , an august National
Assembly can produce Parliamentary Eloquence ; and appoint Committees .
Committees of the Constitution , of Reports , of Researches ; and of much
else : which again yield mountains of Printed Paper ; the theme of new
Parliamentary Eloquence , in bursts , or in plenteous smooth @-@ flowing
floods . And so , from the waste vortex whereon all things go whirling and
grinding , Organic Laws , or the similitude of such , slowly emerge .

With endless debating , we get the Rights of Man written down and
promulgated : true paper basis of all paper Constitutions . Neglecting ,
cry the opponents , to declare the Duties of Man ! Forgetting , answer we ,
to ascertain the Mights of Man ; -- one of the fatalest omissions ! -- Nay ,
sometimes , as on the Fourth of August , our National Assembly , fired
suddenly by an almost preternatural enthusiasm , will get through whole
masses of work in one night . A memorable night , this Fourth of
August : Dignitaries temporal and spiritual ; Peers , Archbishops ,
Parlement @-@ Presidents , each outdoing the other in patriotic devotedness ,
come successively to throw their ( untenable ) possessions on the &apos; altar
of the fatherland . &apos; With louder and louder vivats , for indeed it is
&apos;after dinner &apos; too , -- they abolish Tithes , Seignorial Dues , Gabelle ,
excessive Preservation of Game ; nay Privilege , Immunity , Feudalism root
and branch ; then appoint a Te Deum for it ; and so , finally , disperse
about three in the morning , striking the stars with their sublime heads .
Such night , unforeseen but for ever memorable , was this of the Fourth
of August 1789 . Miraculous , or semi @-@ miraculous , some seem to think it . A
new Night of Pentecost , shall we say , shaped according to the new Time ,
and new Church of Jean Jacques Rousseau ? It had its causes ; also its
effects .

In such manner labour the National Deputies ; perfecting their Theory of
Irregular Verbs ; governing France , and being governed by it ; with toil
and noise ; -- cutting asunder ancient intolerable bonds ; and , for new
ones , assiduously spinning ropes of sand . Were their labours a nothing
or a something , yet the eyes of all France being reverently fixed on
them , History can never very long leave them altogether out of sight .

For the present , if we glance into that Assembly Hall of theirs , it will
be found , as is natural , &apos; most irregular . &apos; As many as &apos; a hundred
members are on their feet at once ; &apos; no rule in making motions , or only
commencements of a rule ; Spectators &apos; Gallery allowed to applaud , and
even to hiss ; ( Arthur Young , i . 111 . ) President , appointed once
a fortnight , raising many times no serene head above the waves .
Nevertheless , as in all human Assemblages , like does begin arranging
itself to like ; the perennial rule , Ubi homines sunt modi sunt , proves
valid . Rudiments of Methods disclose themselves ; rudiments of Parties .
There is a Right Side ( Cote Droit ) , a Left Side ( Cote Gauche ) ; sitting
on M. le President &apos;s right hand , or on his left : the Cote Droit
conservative ; the Cote Gauche destructive . Intermediate is Anglomaniac
Constitutionalism , or Two @-@ Chamber Royalism ; with its Mouniers , its
Lallys , -- fast verging towards nonentity . Preeminent , on the Right Side ,
pleads and perorates Cazales , the Dragoon @-@ captain , eloquent , mildly
fervent ; earning for himself the shadow of a name . There also
blusters Barrel @-@ Mirabeau , the Younger Mirabeau , not without wit : dusky
d &apos;Espremenil does nothing but sniff and ejaculate ; might , it is fondly
thought , lay prostrate the Elder Mirabeau himself , would he but try ,
( Biographie Universelle , para D &apos;Espremenil ( by Beaulieu ) . ) -- which he
does not . Last and greatest , see , for one moment , the Abbe Maury ; with
his jesuitic eyes , his impassive brass face , &apos; image of all the cardinal
sins . &apos; Indomitable , unquenchable , he fights jesuitico @-@ rhetorically ; with
toughest lungs and heart ; for Throne , especially for Altar and Tithes .
So that a shrill voice exclaims once , from the Gallery : &quot; Messieurs of
the Clergy , you have to be shaved ; if you wriggle too much , you will get
cut . &quot; ( Dictionnaire des Hommes Marquans , ii . 519 . )

The Left side is also called the d &apos;Orleans side ; and sometimes
derisively , the Palais Royal . And yet , so confused , real @-@ imaginary
seems everything , &apos; it is doubtful , &apos; as Mirabeau said , &apos; whether d &apos;Orleans
himself belong to that same d &apos;Orleans Party . &apos; What can be known and seen
is , that his moon @-@ visage does beam forth from that point of space . There
likewise sits seagreen Robespierre ; throwing in his light weight , with
decision , not yet with effect . A thin lean Puritan and Precisian ; he
would make away with formulas ; yet lives , moves , and has his being ,
wholly in formulas , of another sort . &apos; Peuple , &apos; such according to
Robespierre ought to be the Royal method of promulgating laws , &apos; Peuple ,
this is the Law I have framed for thee ; dost thou accept it ? &apos; -- answered
from Right Side , from Centre and Left , by inextinguishable laughter .
( Moniteur , No. 67 ( in Hist.Parl. ) . ) Yet men of insight discern that the
Seagreen may by chance go far : &quot; this man , &quot; observes Mirabeau , &quot; will do
somewhat ; he believes every word he says . &quot;

Abbe Sieyes is busy with mere Constitutional work : wherein , unluckily ,
fellow @-@ workmen are less pliable than , with one who has completed the
Science of Polity , they ought to be . Courage , Sieyes nevertheless ! Some
twenty months of heroic travail , of contradiction from the stupid , and
the Constitution shall be built ; the top @-@ stone of it brought out with
shouting , -- say rather , the top @-@ paper , for it is all Paper ; and thou hast
done in it what the Earth or the Heaven could require , thy utmost . Note
likewise this Trio ; memorable for several things ; memorable were it only
that their history is written in an epigram : &apos; whatsoever these Three
have in hand , &apos; it is said , &apos; Duport thinks it , Barnave speaks it , Lameth
does it . &apos; ( See Toulongeon , i. c . 3 . )

But royal Mirabeau ? Conspicuous among all parties , raised above and
beyond them all , this man rises more and more . As we often say , he has
an eye , he is a reality ; while others are formulas and eye @-@ glasses . In
the Transient he will detect the Perennial , find some firm footing even
among Paper @-@ vortexes . His fame is gone forth to all lands ; it gladdened
the heart of the crabbed old Friend of Men himself before he died .
The very Postilions of inns have heard of Mirabeau : when an impatient
Traveller complains that the team is insufficient , his Postilion
answers , &quot; Yes , Monsieur , the wheelers are weak ; but my mirabeau ( main
horse ) , you see , is a right one , mais mon mirabeau est excellent . &quot;
( Dumont , Souvenirs sur Mirabeau , p . 255 . )

And now , Reader , thou shalt quit this noisy Discrepancy of a National
Assembly ; not ( if thou be of humane mind ) without pity . Twelve Hundred
brother men are there , in the centre of Twenty @-@ five Millions ; fighting
so fiercely with Fate and with one another ; struggling their lives
out , as most sons of Adam do , for that which profiteth not . Nay , on
the whole , it is admitted further to be very dull . &quot; Dull as this day &apos;s
Assembly , &quot; said some one . &quot; Why date , Pourquoi dater ? &quot; answered Mirabeau .

Consider that they are Twelve Hundred ; that they not only speak , but
read their speeches ; and even borrow and steal speeches to read ! With
Twelve Hundred fluent speakers , and their Noah &apos;s Deluge of vociferous
commonplace , unattainable silence may well seem the one blessing of
Life . But figure Twelve Hundred pamphleteers ; droning forth perpetual
pamphlets : and no man to gag them ! Neither , as in the American Congress ,
do the arrangements seem perfect . A Senator has not his own Desk
and Newspaper here ; of Tobacco ( much less of Pipes ) there is not the
slightest provision . Conversation itself must be transacted in a low
tone , with continual interruption : only &apos; pencil Notes &apos; circulate freely ;
&apos;in incredible numbers to the foot of the very tribune . &apos; ( See Dumont
( pp. 159 @-@ 67 ) ; Arthur Young , &amp; c . ) -- Such work is it , regenerating a
Nation ; perfecting one &apos;s Theory of Irregular Verbs !



Chapter 1.6.III.

The General Overturn .

Of the King &apos;s Court , for the present , there is almost nothing whatever
to be said . Silent , deserted are these halls ; Royalty languishes
forsaken of its war @-@ god and all its hopes , till once the Oeil @-@ de @-@ Boeuf
rally again . The sceptre is departed from King Louis ; is gone over to
the Salles des Menus , to the Paris Townhall , or one knows not whither .
In the July days , while all ears were yet deafened by the crash of the
Bastille , and Ministers and Princes were scattered to the four winds , it
seemed as if the very Valets had grown heavy of hearing . Besenval , also
in flight towards Infinite Space , but hovering a little at Versailles ,
was addressing his Majesty personally for an Order about post @-@ horses ;
when , lo , &apos; the Valet in waiting places himself familiarly between his
Majesty and me , &apos; stretching out his rascal neck to learn what it was !
His Majesty , in sudden choler , whirled round ; made a clutch at the
tongs : &apos; I gently prevented him ; he grasped my hand in thankfulness ; and
I noticed tears in his eyes . &apos; ( Besenval , iii . 419 . )

Poor King ; for French Kings also are men ! Louis Fourteenth himself
once clutched the tongs , and even smote with them ; but then it was at
Louvois , and Dame Maintenon ran up . -- The Queen sits weeping in her
inner apartments , surrounded by weak women : she is &apos; at the height of
unpopularity ; &apos; universally regarded as the evil genius of France . Her
friends and familiar counsellors have all fled ; and fled , surely , on the
foolishest errand . The Chateau Polignac still frowns aloft , on its &apos; bold
and enormous &apos; cubical rock , amid the blooming champaigns , amid the blue
girdling mountains of Auvergne : ( Arthur Young , i . 165 . ) but no Duke
and Duchess Polignac look forth from it ; they have fled , they have
&apos;met Necker at Bale ; &apos; they shall not return . That France should see her
Nobles resist the Irresistible , Inevitable , with the face of angry men ,
was unhappy , not unexpected : but with the face and sense of pettish
children ? This was her peculiarity . They understood nothing ; would
understand nothing . Does not , at this hour , a new Polignac , first @-@ born
of these Two , sit reflective in the Castle of Ham ; ( A.D. 1835 . ) in an
astonishment he will never recover from ; the most confused of existing
mortals ?

King Louis has his new Ministry : mere Popularities ; Old @-@ President
Pompignan ; Necker , coming back in triumph ; and other such .
( Montgaillard , ii . 108 . ) But what will it avail him ? As was said , the
sceptre , all but the wooden gilt sceptre , has departed elsewhither .
Volition , determination is not in this man : only innocence , indolence ;
dependence on all persons but himself , on all circumstances but the
circumstances he were lord of . So troublous internally is our Versailles
and its work . Beautiful , if seen from afar , resplendent like a Sun ; seen
near at hand , a mere Sun &apos;s @-@ Atmosphere , hiding darkness , confused ferment
of ruin !

But over France , there goes on the indisputablest &apos; destruction of
formulas ; &apos; transaction of realities that follow therefrom . So many
millions of persons , all gyved , and nigh strangled , with formulas ; whose
Life nevertheless , at least the digestion and hunger of it , was real
enough ! Heaven has at length sent an abundant harvest ; but what profits
it the poor man , when Earth with her formulas interposes ? Industry , in
these times of Insurrection , must needs lie dormant ; capital , as usual ,
not circulating , but stagnating timorously in nooks . The poor man is
short of work , is therefore short of money ; nay even had he money , bread
is not to be bought for it . Were it plotting of Aristocrats , plotting
of d &apos;Orleans ; were it Brigands , preternatural terror , and the clang of
Phoebus Apollo &apos;s silver bow , -- enough , the markets are scarce of grain ,
plentiful only in tumult . Farmers seem lazy to thresh ; -- being either
&apos;bribed ; &apos; or needing no bribe , with prices ever rising , with perhaps
rent itself no longer so pressing . Neither , what is singular , do
municipal enactments , &apos; That along with so many measures of wheat you
shall sell so many of rye , &apos; and other the like , much mend the matter .
Dragoons with drawn swords stand ranked among the corn @-@ sacks , often
more dragoons than sacks . ( Arthur Young , i . 129 , &amp; c . ) Meal @-@ mobs abound ;
growing into mobs of a still darker quality .

Starvation has been known among the French Commonalty before this ; known
and familiar . Did we not see them , in the year 1775 , presenting ,
in sallow faces , in wretchedness and raggedness , their Petition of
Grievances ; and , for answer , getting a brand @-@ new Gallows forty feet
high ? Hunger and Darkness , through long years ! For look back on that
earlier Paris Riot , when a Great Personage , worn out by debauchery , was
believed to be in want of Blood @-@ baths ; and Mothers , in worn raiment , yet
with living hearts under it , &apos; filled the public places &apos; with their wild
Rachel @-@ cries , -- stilled also by the Gallows . Twenty years ago , the
Friend of Men ( preaching to the deaf ) described the Limousin Peasants as
wearing a pain @-@ stricken ( souffre @-@ douleur ) look , a look past complaint ,
&apos;as if the oppression of the great were like the hail and the thunder , a
thing irremediable , the ordinance of Nature . &apos; ( Fils Adoptif : Memoires
de Mirabeau , i . 364 @-@ 394 . ) And now , if in some great hour , the shock of
a falling Bastille should awaken you ; and it were found to be the
ordinance of Art merely ; and remediable , reversible !

Or has the Reader forgotten that &apos; flood of savages , &apos; which , in sight
of the same Friend of Men , descended from the mountains at Mont d &apos;Or ?
Lank @-@ haired haggard faces ; shapes rawboned , in high sabots ; in woollen
jupes , with leather girdles studded with copper @-@ nails ! They rocked from
foot to foot , and beat time with their elbows too , as the quarrel and
battle which was not long in beginning went on ; shouting fiercely ; the
lank faces distorted into the similitude of a cruel laugh . For they were
darkened and hardened : long had they been the prey of excise @-@ men and
tax @-@ men ; of &apos; clerks with the cold spurt of their pen . &apos; It was the fixed
prophecy of our old Marquis , which no man would listen to , that &apos; such
Government by Blind @-@ man &apos;s @-@ buff , stumbling along too far , would end by
the General Overturn , the Culbute Generale ! &apos;

No man would listen , each went his thoughtless way ; -- and Time and
Destiny also travelled on . The Government by Blind @-@ man &apos;s @-@ buff , stumbling
along , has reached the precipice inevitable for it . Dull Drudgery ,
driven on , by clerks with the cold dastard spurt of their pen , has been
driven -- into a Communion of Drudges ! For now , moreover , there have
come the strangest confused tidings ; by Paris Journals with their paper
wings ; or still more portentous , where no Journals are , ( See Arthur
Young , i . 137 , 150 , &amp; c . ) by rumour and conjecture : Oppression not
inevitable ; a Bastille prostrate , and the Constitution fast getting
ready ! Which Constitution , if it be something and not nothing , what can
it be but bread to eat ?

The Traveller , &apos; walking up hill bridle in hand , &apos; overtakes &apos; a poor
woman ; &apos; the image , as such commonly are , of drudgery and scarcity ;
&apos;looking sixty years of age , though she is not yet twenty @-@ eight . &apos; They
have seven children , her poor drudge and she : a farm , with one cow ,
which helps to make the children soup ; also one little horse , or garron .
They have rents and quit @-@ rents , Hens to pay to this Seigneur , Oat @-@ sacks
to that ; King &apos;s taxes , Statute @-@ labour , Church @-@ taxes , taxes enough ; -- and
think the times inexpressible . She has heard that somewhere , in some
manner , something is to be done for the poor : &quot; God send it soon ; for the
dues and taxes crush us down ( nous ecrasent ) ! &quot; ( Ibid. i . 134 . )

Fair prophecies are spoken , but they are not fulfilled . There have
been Notables , Assemblages , turnings out and comings in . Intriguing and
manoeuvring ; Parliamentary eloquence and arguing , Greek meeting Greek in
high places , has long gone on ; yet still bread comes not . The harvest is
reaped and garnered ; yet still we have no bread . Urged by despair and
by hope , what can Drudgery do , but rise , as predicted , and produce the
General Overturn ?

Fancy , then , some Five full @-@ grown Millions of such gaunt figures ,
with their haggard faces ( figures haves ) ; in woollen jupes , with
copper @-@ studded leather girths , and high sabots , -- starting up to ask , as
in forest @-@ roarings , their washed Upper @-@ Classes , after long unreviewed
centuries , virtually this question : How have ye treated us ; how have ye
taught us , fed us , and led us , while we toiled for you ? The answer can
be read in flames , over the nightly summer sky . This is the feeding and
leading we have had of you : EMPTINESS , -- of pocket , of stomach , of head ,
and of heart . Behold there is nothing in us ; nothing but what Nature
gives her wild children of the desert : Ferocity and Appetite ; Strength
grounded on Hunger . Did ye mark among your Rights of Man , that man was
not to die of starvation , while there was bread reaped by him ? It is
among the Mights of Man .

Seventy @-@ two Chateaus have flamed aloft in the Maconnais and Beaujolais
alone : this seems the centre of the conflagration ; but it has spread
over Dauphine , Alsace , the Lyonnais ; the whole South @-@ East is in a blaze .
All over the North , from Rouen to Metz , disorder is abroad : smugglers
of salt go openly in armed bands : the barriers of towns are burnt ;
toll @-@ gatherers , tax @-@ gatherers , official persons put to flight . &apos; It was
thought , &apos; says Young , &apos; the people , from hunger , would revolt ; &apos; and we
see they have done it . Desperate Lackalls , long prowling aimless , now
finding hope in desperation itself , everywhere form a nucleus . They ring
the Church bell by way of tocsin : and the Parish turns out to the work .
( See Hist . Parl. ii . 243 @-@ 6 . ) Ferocity , atrocity ; hunger and revenge :
such work as we can imagine !

Ill stands it now with the Seigneur , who , for example , &apos; has walled up
the only Fountain of the Township ; &apos; who has ridden high on his chartier
and parchments ; who has preserved Game not wisely but too well . Churches
also , and Canonries , are sacked , without mercy ; which have shorn the
flock too close , forgetting to feed it . Wo to the land over which
Sansculottism , in its day of vengeance , tramps roughshod , -- shod in
sabots ! Highbred Seigneurs , with their delicate women and little ones ,
had to &apos; fly half @-@ naked , &apos; under cloud of night ; glad to escape the
flames , and even worse . You meet them at the tables @-@ d &apos;hote of inns ;
making wise reflections or foolish that &apos; rank is destroyed ; &apos; uncertain
whither they shall now wend . ( See Young , i . 149 , &amp; c . ) The metayer will
find it convenient to be slack in paying rent . As for the Tax @-@ gatherer ,
he , long hunting as a biped of prey , may now get hunted as one ; his
Majesty &apos;s Exchequer will not &apos; fill up the Deficit , &apos; this season : it is
the notion of many that a Patriot Majesty , being the Restorer of French
Liberty , has abolished most taxes , though , for their private ends , some
men make a secret of it .

Where this will end ? In the Abyss , one may prophecy ; whither all
Delusions are , at all moments , travelling ; where this Delusion has now
arrived . For if there be a Faith , from of old , it is this , as we often
repeat , that no Lie can live for ever . The very Truth has to change
its vesture , from time to time ; and be born again . But all Lies have
sentence of death written down against them , and Heaven &apos;s Chancery
itself ; and , slowly or fast , advance incessantly towards their hour .
&apos;The sign of a Grand Seigneur being landlord , &apos; says the vehement
plain @-@ spoken Arthur Young , &apos; are wastes , landes , deserts , ling : go to
his residence , you will find it in the middle of a forest , peopled
with deer , wild boars and wolves . The fields are scenes of pitiable
management , as the houses are of misery . To see so many millions of
hands , that would be industrious , all idle and starving : Oh , if I were
legislator of France , for one day , I would make these great lords skip
again ! &apos; ( Arthur Young , i . 12 , 48 , 84 , &amp; c . ) O Arthur , thou now actually
beholdest them skip : -- wilt thou grow to grumble at that too ?

For long years and generations it lasted , but the time came .
Featherbrain , whom no reasoning and no pleading could touch , the glare
of the firebrand had to illuminate : there remained but that method .
Consider it , look at it ! The widow is gathering nettles for her
children &apos;s dinner ; a perfumed Seigneur , delicately lounging in the
Oeil @-@ de @-@ Boeuf , has an alchemy whereby he will extract from her the third
nettle , and name it Rent and Law : such an arrangement must end . Ought
it ? But , O most fearful is such an ending ! Let those , to whom God , in
His great mercy , has granted time and space , prepare another and milder
one .

To women it is a matter of wonder that the Seigneurs did not do
something to help themselves ; say , combine , and arm : for there were a
&apos;hundred and fifty thousand of them , &apos; all violent enough . Unhappily , a
hundred and fifty thousand , scattered over wide Provinces , divided by
mutual ill @-@ will , cannot combine . The highest Seigneurs , as we have seen ,
had already emigrated , -- with a view of putting France to the blush .
Neither are arms now the peculiar property of Seigneurs ; but of every
mortal who has ten shillings , wherewith to buy a secondhand firelock .

Besides , those starving Peasants , after all , have not four feet and
claws , that you could keep them down permanently in that manner . They
are not even of black colour ; they are mere Unwashed Seigneurs ; and
a Seigneur too has human bowels ! -- The Seigneurs did what they could ;
enrolled in National Guards ; fled , with shrieks , complaining to Heaven
and Earth . One Seigneur , famed Memmay of Quincey , near Vesoul , invited
all the rustics of his neighbourhood to a banquet ; blew up his Chateau
and them with gunpowder ; and instantaneously vanished , no man yet knows
whither . ( Hist . Parl. ii . 161 . ) Some half dozen years after , he came
back ; and demonstrated that it was by accident .

Nor are the authorities idle : though unluckily , all Authorities ,
Municipalities and such like , are in the uncertain transitionary state ;
getting regenerated from old Monarchic to new Democratic ; no Official
yet knows clearly what he is . Nevertheless , Mayors old or new do gather
Marechaussees , National Guards , Troops of the line ; justice , of the most
summary sort , is not wanting . The Electoral Committee of Macon , though
but a Committee , goes the length of hanging , for its own behoof , as many
as twenty . The Prevot of Dauphine traverses the country &apos; with a movable
column , &apos; with tipstaves , gallows @-@ ropes ; for gallows any tree will serve ,
and suspend its culprit , or &apos; thirteen &apos; culprits .

Unhappy country ! How is the fair gold @-@ and @-@ green of the ripe bright Year
defaced with horrid blackness : black ashes of Chateaus , black bodies of
gibetted Men ! Industry has ceased in it ; not sounds of the hammer and
saw , but of the tocsin and alarm @-@ drum . The sceptre has departed ,
whither one knows not ; -- breaking itself in pieces : here impotent , there
tyrannous . National Guards are unskilful , and of doubtful purpose ;
Soldiers are inclined to mutiny : there is danger that they two may
quarrel , danger that they may agree . Strasburg has seen riots : a
Townhall torn to shreds , its archives scattered white on the winds ;
drunk soldiers embracing drunk citizens for three days , and Mayor
Dietrich and Marshal Rochambeau reduced nigh to desperation . ( Arthur
Young , i . 141 . -- Dampmartin : Evenemens qui se sont passes sous mes yeux ,
i . 105 @-@ 127 . )

Through the middle of all which phenomena , is seen , on his triumphant
transit , &apos; escorted , &apos; through Befort for instance , &apos; by fifty National
Horsemen and all the military music of the place , &apos; -- M. Necker , returning
from Bale ! Glorious as the meridian ; though poor Necker himself partly
guesses whither it is leading . ( Biographie Universelle , para Necker ( by
Lally @-@ Tollendal ) . ) One highest culminating day , at the Paris Townhall ;
with immortal vivats , with wife and daughter kneeling publicly to kiss
his hand ; with Besenval &apos;s pardon granted , -- but indeed revoked before
sunset : one highest day , but then lower days , and ever lower , down even
to lowest ! Such magic is in a name ; and in the want of a name . Like some
enchanted Mambrino &apos;s Helmet , essential to victory , comes this &apos; Saviour
of France ; &apos; beshouted , becymballed by the world : -- alas , so soon , to
be disenchanted , to be pitched shamefully over the lists as a Barber &apos;s
Bason ! Gibbon &apos; could wish to shew him &apos; ( in this ejected , Barber &apos;s @-@ Bason
state ) to any man of solidity , who were minded to have the soul burnt
out of him , and become a caput mortuum , by Ambition , unsuccessful or
successful . ( Gibbon &apos;s Letters . )

Another small phasis we add , and no more : how , in the Autumn months , our
sharp @-@ tempered Arthur has been &apos; pestered for some days past , &apos; by shot ,
lead @-@ drops and slugs , &apos; rattling five or six times into my chaise and
about my ears ; &apos; all the mob of the country gone out to kill game !
( Young , i . 176 . ) It is even so . On the Cliffs of Dover , over all the
Marches of France , there appear , this autumn , two Signs on the Earth :
emigrant flights of French Seigneurs ; emigrant winged flights of French
Game ! Finished , one may say , or as good as finished , is the Preservation
of Game on this Earth ; completed for endless Time . What part it had to
play in the History of Civilisation is played plaudite ; exeat !

In this manner does Sansculottism blaze up , illustrating many
things ; -- producing , among the rest , as we saw , on the Fourth of August ,
that semi @-@ miraculous Night of Pentecost in the National Assembly ; semi
miraculous , which had its causes , and its effects . Feudalism is struck
dead ; not on parchment only , and by ink ; but in very fact , by fire ; say ,
by self @-@ combustion . This conflagration of the South @-@ East will abate ;
will be got scattered , to the West , or elsewhither : extinguish it will
not , till the fuel be all done .



Chapter 1.6.IV.

In Queue .

If we look now at Paris , one thing is too evident : that the Baker &apos;s
shops have got their Queues , or Tails ; their long strings of purchasers ,
arranged in tail , so that the first come be the first served , -- were the
shop once open ! This waiting in tail , not seen since the early days of
July , again makes its appearance in August . In time , we shall see it
perfected by practice to the rank almost of an art ; and the art , or
quasi @-@ art , of standing in tail become one of the characteristics of the
Parisian People , distinguishing them from all other Peoples whatsoever .

But consider , while work itself is so scarce , how a man must not only
realise money ; but stand waiting ( if his wife is too weak to wait and
struggle ) for half days in the Tail , till he get it changed for dear
bad bread ! Controversies , to the length , sometimes of blood and battery ,
must arise in these exasperated Queues . Or if no controversy , then it is
but one accordant Pange Lingua of complaint against the Powers that
be . France has begun her long Curriculum of Hungering , instructive and
productive beyond Academic Curriculums ; which extends over some seven
most strenuous years . As Jean Paul says , of his own Life , &apos; to a great
height shall the business of Hungering go . &apos; 

Or consider , in strange contrast , the jubilee Ceremonies ; for , in
general , the aspect of Paris presents these two features : jubilee
ceremonials and scarcity of victual . Processions enough walk in jubilee ;
of Young Women , decked and dizened , their ribands all tricolor ; moving
with song and tabor , to the Shrine of Sainte Genevieve , to thank her
that the Bastille is down . The Strong Men of the Market , and the Strong
Women , fail not with their bouquets and speeches . Abbe Fauchet , famed
in such work ( for Abbe Lefevre could only distribute powder ) blesses
tricolor cloth for the National Guard ; and makes it a National Tricolor
Flag ; victorious , or to be victorious , in the cause of civil and
religious liberty all over the world . Fauchet , we say , is the man for
Te @-@ Deums , and public Consecrations ; -- to which , as in this instance of
the Flag , our National Guard will &apos; reply with volleys of musketry , &apos;
Church and Cathedral though it be ; ( See Hist . Parl. iii . 20 ; Mercier ,
Nouveau Paris , &amp; c . ) filling Notre Dame with such noisiest fuliginous
Amen , significant of several things .

On the whole , we will say our new Mayor Bailly ; our new Commander
Lafayette , named also &apos; Scipio @-@ Americanus , &apos; have bought their preferment
dear . Bailly rides in gilt state @-@ coach , with beefeaters and sumptuosity ;
Camille Desmoulins , and others , sniffing at him for it : Scipio bestrides
the &apos; white charger , &apos; and waves with civic plumes in sight of all France .
Neither of them , however , does it for nothing ; but , in truth , at an
exorbitant rate . At this rate , namely : of feeding Paris , and keeping
it from fighting . Out of the City @-@ funds , some seventeen thousand of the
utterly destitute are employed digging on Montmartre , at tenpence a day ,
which buys them , at market price , almost two pounds of bad bread ; -- they
look very yellow , when Lafayette goes to harangue them . The Townhall
is in travail , night and day ; it must bring forth Bread , a Municipal
Constitution , regulations of all kinds , curbs on the Sansculottic Press ;
above all , Bread , Bread .

Purveyors prowl the country far and wide , with the appetite of lions ;
detect hidden grain , purchase open grain ; by gentle means or forcible ,
must and will find grain . A most thankless task ; and so difficult ,
so dangerous , -- even if a man did gain some trifle by it ! On the 19th
August , there is food for one day . ( See Bailly , Memoires , ii . 137 @-@ 409 . )
Complaints there are that the food is spoiled , and produces an effect
on the intestines : not corn but plaster @-@ of @-@ Paris ! Which effect on the
intestines , as well as that &apos; smarting in the throat and palate , &apos; a
Townhall Proclamation warns you to disregard , or even to consider as
drastic @-@ beneficial . The Mayor of Saint @-@ Denis , so black was his bread ,
has , by a dyspeptic populace , been hanged on the Lanterne there .
National Guards protect the Paris Corn @-@ Market : first ten suffice ; then
six hundred . ( Hist . Parl. ii . 421 . ) Busy are ye , Bailly , Brissot de
Warville , Condorcet , and ye others !

For , as just hinted , there is a Municipal Constitution to be made too .
The old Bastille Electors , after some ten days of psalmodying over their
glorious victory , began to hear it asked , in a splenetic tone , Who put
you there ? They accordingly had to give place , not without moanings , and
audible growlings on both sides , to a new larger Body , specially elected
for that post . Which new Body , augmented , altered , then fixed finally
at the number of Three Hundred , with the title of Town Representatives
( Representans de la Commune ) , now sits there ; rightly portioned into
Committees ; assiduous making a Constitution ; at all moments when not
seeking flour .

And such a Constitution ; little short of miraculous : one that shall
&apos;consolidate the Revolution &apos; ! The Revolution is finished , then ? Mayor
Bailly and all respectable friends of Freedom would fain think so . Your
Revolution , like jelly sufficiently boiled , needs only to be poured into
shapes , of Constitution , and &apos; consolidated &apos; therein ? Could it , indeed ,
contrive to cool ; which last , however , is precisely the doubtful thing ,
or even the not doubtful !

Unhappy friends of Freedom ; consolidating a Revolution ! They must sit
at work there , their pavilion spread on very Chaos ; between two hostile
worlds , the Upper Court @-@ world , the Nether Sansculottic one ; and , beaten
on by both , toil painfully , perilously , -- doing , in sad literal earnest ,
&apos;the impossible . &apos; 



Chapter 1.6.V.

The Fourth Estate .

Pamphleteering opens its abysmal throat wider and wider : never to close
more . Our Philosophes , indeed , rather withdraw ; after the manner of
Marmontel , &apos; retiring in disgust the first day . &apos; Abbe Raynal , grown gray
and quiet in his Marseilles domicile , is little content with this work ;
the last literary act of the man will again be an act of rebellion : an
indignant Letter to the Constituent Assembly ; answered by &apos; the order
of the day . &apos; Thus also Philosophe Morellet puckers discontented brows ;
being indeed threatened in his benefices by that Fourth of August : it
is clearly going too far . How astonishing that those &apos; haggard figures
in woollen jupes &apos; would not rest as satisfied with Speculation , and
victorious Analysis , as we !

Alas , yes : Speculation , Philosophism , once the ornament and wealth of
the saloon , will now coin itself into mere Practical Propositions , and
circulate on street and highway , universally ; with results ! A Fourth
Estate , of Able Editors , springs up ; increases and multiplies ;
irrepressible , incalculable . New Printers , new Journals , and ever new
( so prurient is the world ) , let our Three Hundred curb and consolidate
as they can ! Loustalot , under the wing of Prudhomme dull @-@ blustering
Printer , edits weekly his Revolutions de Paris ; in an acrid , emphatic
manner . Acrid , corrosive , as the spirit of sloes and copperas , is Marat ,
Friend of the People ; struck already with the fact that the National
Assembly , so full of Aristocrats , &apos; can do nothing , &apos; except dissolve
itself , and make way for a better ; that the Townhall Representatives are
little other than babblers and imbeciles , if not even knaves . Poor is
this man ; squalid , and dwells in garrets ; a man unlovely to the sense ,
outward and inward ; a man forbid ; -- and is becoming fanatical , possessed
with fixed @-@ idea . Cruel lusus of Nature ! Did Nature , O poor Marat , as
in cruel sport , knead thee out of her leavings , and miscellaneous
waste clay ; and fling thee forth stepdamelike , a Distraction into this
distracted Eighteenth Century ? Work is appointed thee there ; which thou
shalt do . The Three Hundred have summoned and will again summon Marat :
but always he croaks forth answer sufficient ; always he will defy them ,
or elude them ; and endure no gag .

Carra , &apos; Ex @-@ secretary of a decapitated Hospodar , &apos; and then of a
Necklace @-@ Cardinal ; likewise pamphleteer , Adventurer in many scenes and
lands , -- draws nigh to Mercier , of the Tableau de Paris ; and , with foam
on his lips , proposes an Annales Patriotiques . The Moniteur goes its
prosperous way ; Barrere &apos; weeps , &apos; on Paper as yet loyal ; Rivarol , Royou
are not idle . Deep calls to deep : your Domine Salvum Fac Regem shall
awaken Pange Lingua ; with an Ami @-@ du @-@ Peuple there is a King &apos;s @-@ Friend
Newspaper , Ami @-@ du @-@ Roi . Camille Desmoulins has appointed himself
Procureur @-@ General de la Lanterne , Attorney @-@ General of the Lamp @-@ iron ; and
pleads , not with atrocity , under an atrocious title ; editing weekly his
brilliant Revolutions of Paris and Brabant . Brilliant , we say : for if ,
in that thick murk of Journalism , with its dull blustering , with
its fixed or loose fury , any ray of genius greet thee , be sure it is
Camille &apos;s . The thing that Camille teaches he , with his light finger ,
adorns : brightness plays , gentle , unexpected , amid horrible confusions ;
often is the word of Camille worth reading , when no other &apos;s is .
Questionable Camille , how thou glitterest with a fallen , rebellious , yet
still semi @-@ celestial light ; as is the star @-@ light on the brow of Lucifer !
Son of the Morning , into what times and what lands , art thou fallen !

But in all things is good ; -- though not good for &apos; consolidating
Revolutions . &apos; Thousand wagon @-@ loads of this Pamphleteering and Newspaper
matter , lie rotting slowly in the Public Libraries of our Europe .
Snatched from the great gulf , like oysters by bibliomaniac pearl @-@ divers ,
there must they first rot , then what was pearl , in Camille or others ,
may be seen as such , and continue as such .

Nor has public speaking declined , though Lafayette and his Patrols look
sour on it . Loud always is the Palais Royal , loudest the Cafe de Foy ;
such a miscellany of Citizens and Citizenesses circulating there . &apos; Now
and then , &apos; according to Camille , &apos; some Citizens employ the liberty of
the press for a private purpose ; so that this or the other Patriot finds
himself short of his watch or pocket @-@ handkerchief ! &apos; But , for the rest ,
in Camille &apos;s opinion , nothing can be a livelier image of the Roman
Forum . &apos; A Patriot proposes his motion ; if it finds any supporters , they
make him mount on a chair , and speak . If he is applauded , he prospers
and redacts ; if he is hissed , he goes his ways . &apos; Thus they , circulating
and perorating . Tall shaggy Marquis Saint @-@ Huruge , a man that has
had losses , and has deserved them , is seen eminent , and also heard .
&apos;Bellowing &apos; is the character of his voice , like that of a Bull of
Bashan ; voice which drowns all voices , which causes frequently the
hearts of men to leap . Cracked or half @-@ cracked is this tall Marquis &apos;s
head ; uncracked are his lungs ; the cracked and the uncracked shall alike
avail him .

Consider further that each of the Forty @-@ eight Districts has its own
Committee ; speaking and motioning continually ; aiding in the search for
grain , in the search for a Constitution ; checking and spurring the poor
Three Hundred of the Townhall . That Danton , with a &apos; voice reverberating
from the domes , &apos; is President of the Cordeliers District ; which has
already become a Goshen of Patriotism . That apart from the &apos; seventeen
thousand utterly necessitous , digging on Montmartre , &apos; most of whom ,
indeed , have got passes , and been dismissed into Space &apos; with four
shillings , &apos; -- there is a strike , or union , of Domestics out of place ; who
assemble for public speaking : next , a strike of Tailors , for even they
will strike and speak ; further , a strike of Journeymen Cordwainers ; a
strike of Apothecaries : so dear is bread . ( Histoire Parlementaire , ii .
359 , 417 , 423 . ) All these , having struck , must speak ; generally under
the open canopy ; and pass resolutions ; -- Lafayette and his Patrols
watching them suspiciously from the distance .

Unhappy mortals : such tugging and lugging , and throttling of one
another , to divide , in some not intolerable way , the joint Felicity of
man in this Earth ; when the whole lot to be divided is such a &apos; feast of
shells ! &apos; -- Diligent are the Three Hundred ; none equals Scipio Americanus
in dealing with mobs . But surely all these things bode ill for the
consolidating of a Revolution .

THE INSURRECTION OF WOMEN


Chapter 1.7.I.

Patrollotism .

No , Friends , this Revolution is not of the consolidating kind . Do
not fires , fevers , sown seeds , chemical mixtures , men , events ; all
embodiments of Force that work in this miraculous Complex of Forces ,
named Universe , -- go on growing , through their natural phases and
developments , each according to its kind ; reach their height , reach
their visible decline ; finally sink under , vanishing , and what we call
die ? They all grow ; there is nothing but what grows , and shoots forth
into its special expansion , -- once give it leave to spring . Observe too
that each grows with a rapidity proportioned , in general , to the madness
and unhealthiness there is in it : slow regular growth , though this also
ends in death , is what we name health and sanity .

A Sansculottism , which has prostrated Bastilles , which has got pike
and musket , and now goes burning Chateaus , passing resolutions and
haranguing under roof and sky , may be said to have sprung ; and , by law
of Nature , must grow . To judge by the madness and diseasedness both
of itself , and of the soil and element it is in , one might expect the
rapidity and monstrosity would be extreme .

Many things too , especially all diseased things , grow by shoots and
fits . The first grand fit and shooting forth of Sansculottism with
that of Paris conquering its King ; for Bailly &apos;s figure of rhetoric was
all @-@ too sad a reality . The King is conquered ; going at large on his
parole ; on condition , say , of absolutely good behaviour , -- which , in
these circumstances , will unhappily mean no behaviour whatever . A quite
untenable position , that of Majesty put on its good behaviour ! Alas , is
it not natural that whatever lives try to keep itself living ? Whereupon
his Majesty &apos;s behaviour will soon become exceptionable ; and so the
Second grand Fit of Sansculottism , that of putting him in durance ,
cannot be distant .

Necker , in the National Assembly , is making moan , as usual about his
Deficit : Barriers and Customhouses burnt ; the Tax @-@ gatherer hunted , not
hunting ; his Majesty &apos;s Exchequer all but empty . The remedy is a Loan of
thirty millions ; then , on still more enticing terms , a Loan of eighty
millions : neither of which Loans , unhappily , will the Stockjobbers
venture to lend . The Stockjobber has no country , except his own black
pool of Agio .

And yet , in those days , for men that have a country , what a glow of
patriotism burns in many a heart ; penetrating inwards to the very purse !
So early as the 7th of August , a Don Patriotique , &apos; a Patriotic Gift
of jewels to a considerable extent , &apos; has been solemnly made by certain
Parisian women ; and solemnly accepted , with honourable mention . Whom
forthwith all the world takes to imitating and emulating . Patriotic
Gifts , always with some heroic eloquence , which the President must
answer and the Assembly listen to , flow in from far and near : in such
number that the honourable mention can only be performed in &apos; lists
published at stated epochs . &apos; Each gives what he can : the very
cordwainers have behaved munificently ; one landed proprietor gives a
forest ; fashionable society gives its shoebuckles , takes cheerfully to
shoe @-@ ties . Unfortunate females give what they &apos; have amassed in loving . &apos; 
( Histoire Parlementaire , ii . 427 . ) The smell of all cash , as Vespasian
thought , is good .

Beautiful , and yet inadequate ! The Clergy must be &apos; invited &apos; to melt
their superfluous Church @-@ plate , -- in the Royal Mint . Nay finally , a
Patriotic Contribution , of the forcible sort , must be determined on ,
though unwillingly : let the fourth part of your declared yearly revenue ,
for this once only , be paid down ; so shall a National Assembly make the
Constitution , undistracted at least by insolvency . Their own wages , as
settled on the 17th of August , are but Eighteen Francs a day , each man ;
but the Public Service must have sinews , must have money . To appease the
Deficit ; not to &apos; combler , or choke the Deficit , &apos; if you or mortal could !
For withal , as Mirabeau was heard saying , &quot; it is the Deficit that saves
us . &quot;

Towards the end of August , our National Assembly in its constitutional
labours , has got so far as the question of Veto : shall Majesty have a
Veto on the National Enactments ; or not have a Veto ? What speeches were
spoken , within doors and without ; clear , and also passionate logic ;
imprecations , comminations ; gone happily , for most part , to Limbo !
Through the cracked brain , and uncracked lungs of Saint @-@ Huruge , the
Palais Royal rebellows with Veto . Journalism is busy , France rings with
Veto . &apos; I shall never forget , &apos; says Dumont , &apos; my going to Paris , one of
these days , with Mirabeau ; and the crowd of people we found waiting for
his carriage , about Le Jay the Bookseller &apos;s shop . They flung themselves
before him ; conjuring him with tears in their eyes not to suffer the
Veto Absolu . They were in a frenzy : &quot; Monsieur le Comte , you are the
people &apos;s father ; you must save us ; you must defend us against those
villains who are bringing back Despotism . If the King get this Veto ,
what is the use of National Assembly ? We are slaves , all is done . &quot; &apos;
( Souvenirs sur Mirabeau , p . 156 . ) Friends , if the sky fall , there
will be catching of larks ! Mirabeau , adds Dumont , was eminent on such
occasions : he answered vaguely , with a Patrician imperturbability , and
bound himself to nothing .

Deputations go to the Hotel @-@ de @-@ Ville ; anonymous Letters to Aristocrats
in the National Assembly , threatening that fifteen thousand , or
sometimes that sixty thousand , &apos; will march to illuminate you . &apos; The Paris
Districts are astir ; Petitions signing : Saint @-@ Huruge sets forth from the
Palais Royal , with an escort of fifteen hundred individuals , to petition
in person . Resolute , or seemingly so , is the tall shaggy Marquis , is
the Cafe de Foy : but resolute also is Commandant @-@ General Lafayette .
The streets are all beset by Patrols : Saint @-@ Huruge is stopped at the
Barriere des Bon Hommes ; he may bellow like the bulls of Bashan ; but
absolutely must return . The brethren of the Palais Royal &apos; circulate all
night , &apos; and make motions , under the open canopy ; all Coffee @-@ houses being
shut . Nevertheless Lafayette and the Townhall do prevail : Saint @-@ Huruge
is thrown into prison ; Veto Absolu adjusts itself into Suspensive Veto ,
prohibition not forever , but for a term of time ; and this doom &apos;s @-@ clamour
will grow silent , as the others have done .

So far has Consolidation prospered , though with difficulty ; repressing
the Nether Sansculottic world ; and the Constitution shall be made . With
difficulty : amid jubilee and scarcity ; Patriotic Gifts , Bakers &apos; -queues ;
Abbe @-@ Fauchet Harangues , with their Amen of platoon @-@ musketry ! Scipio
Americanus has deserved thanks from the National Assembly and France .
They offer him stipends and emoluments , to a handsome extent ; all which
stipends and emoluments he , covetous of far other blessedness than mere
money , does , in his chivalrous way , without scruple , refuse .

To the Parisian common man , meanwhile , one thing remains inconceivable :
that now when the Bastille is down , and French Liberty restored , grain
should continue so dear . Our Rights of Man are voted , Feudalism and
all Tyranny abolished ; yet behold we stand in queue ! Is it Aristocrat
forestallers ; a Court still bent on intrigues ? Something is rotten ,
somewhere .

And yet , alas , what to do ? Lafayette , with his Patrols prohibits every
thing , even complaint . Saint @-@ Huruge and other heroes of the Veto lie
in durance . People &apos;s @-@ Friend Marat was seized ; Printers of Patriotic
Journals are fettered and forbidden ; the very Hawkers cannot cry , till
they get license , and leaden badges . Blue National Guards ruthlessly
dissipate all groups ; scour , with levelled bayonets , the Palais Royal
itself . Pass , on your affairs , along the Rue Taranne , the Patrol ,
presenting his bayonet , cries , To the left ! Turn into the Rue
Saint @-@ Benoit , he cries , To the right ! A judicious Patriot ( like Camille
Desmoulins , in this instance ) is driven , for quietness &apos;s sake , to take
the gutter .

O much @-@ suffering People , our glorious Revolution is evaporating in
tricolor ceremonies , and complimentary harangues ! Of which latter ,
as Loustalot acridly calculates , &apos; upwards of two thousand have been
delivered within the last month , at the Townhall alone . &apos; ( Revolutions
de Paris Newspaper ( cited in Histoire Parlementaire , ii . 357 ) . ) And
our mouths , unfilled with bread , are to be shut , under penalties ? The
Caricaturist promulgates his emblematic Tablature : Le Patrouillotisme
chassant le Patriotisme , Patriotism driven out by Patrollotism . Ruthless
Patrols ; long superfine harangues ; and scanty ill @-@ baked loaves , more
like baked Bath bricks , -- which produce an effect on the intestines !
Where will this end ? In consolidation ?



Chapter 1.7.II.

O Richard , O my King .

For , alas , neither is the Townhall itself without misgivings . The Nether
Sansculottic world has been suppressed hitherto : but then the Upper
Court @-@ world ! Symptoms there are that the Oeil @-@ de @-@ Boeuf is rallying .

More than once in the Townhall Sanhedrim ; often enough , from those
outspoken Bakers &apos; -queues , has the wish uttered itself : O that our
Restorer of French Liberty were here ; that he could see with his own
eyes , not with the false eyes of Queens and Cabals , and his really good
heart be enlightened ! For falsehood still environs him ; intriguing
Dukes de Guiche , with Bodyguards ; scouts of Bouille ; a new flight of
intriguers , now that the old is flown . What else means this advent of
the Regiment de Flandre ; entering Versailles , as we hear , on the 23rd
of September , with two pieces of cannon ? Did not the Versailles National
Guard do duty at the Chateau ? Had they not Swiss ; Hundred Swiss ;
Gardes @-@ du @-@ Corps , Bodyguards so @-@ called ? Nay , it would seem , the number of
Bodyguards on duty has , by a manoeuvre , been doubled : the new relieving
Battalion of them arrived at its time ; but the old relieved one does not
depart !

Actually , there runs a whisper through the best informed Upper @-@ Circles ,
or a nod still more potentous than whispering , of his Majesty &apos;s flying
to Metz ; of a Bond ( to stand by him therein ) which has been signed by
Noblesse and Clergy , to the incredible amount of thirty , or even of
sixty thousand . Lafayette coldly whispers it , and coldly asseverates
it , to Count d &apos;Estaing at the Dinner @-@ table ; and d &apos;Estaing , one of
the bravest men , quakes to the core lest some lackey overhear it ; and
tumbles thoughtful , without sleep , all night . ( Brouillon de Lettre de
M. d &apos;Estaing a la Reine in Histoire Parlementaire , iii . 24 . ) Regiment
Flandre , as we said , is clearly arrived . His Majesty , they say ,
hesitates about sanctioning the Fourth of August ; makes observations ,
of chilling tenor , on the very Rights of Man ! Likewise , may not all
persons , the Bakers &apos; -queues themselves discern on the streets of Paris ,
the most astonishing number of Officers on furlough , Crosses of St.
Louis , and such like ? Some reckon &apos; from a thousand to twelve hundred . &apos; 
Officers of all uniforms ; nay one uniform never before seen by eye :
green faced with red ! The tricolor cockade is not always visible : but
what , in the name of Heaven , may these black cockades , which some wear ,
foreshadow ?

Hunger whets everything , especially Suspicion and Indignation . Realities
themselves , in this Paris , have grown unreal : preternatural . Phantasms
once more stalk through the brain of hungry France . O ye laggards and
dastards , cry shrill voices from the Queues , if ye had the hearts of
men , ye would take your pikes and secondhand firelocks , and look into
it ; not leave your wives and daughters to be starved , murdered , and
worse ! -- Peace , women ! The heart of man is bitter and heavy ; Patriotism ,
driven out by Patrollotism , knows not what to resolve on .

The truth is , the Oeil @-@ de @-@ Boeuf has rallied ; to a certain unknown
extent . A changed Oeil @-@ de @-@ Boeuf ; with Versailles National Guards , in
their tricolor cockades , doing duty there ; a Court all flaring with
tricolor ! Yet even to a tricolor Court men will rally . Ye loyal hearts ,
burnt @-@ out Seigneurs , rally round your Queen ! With wishes ; which will
produce hopes ; which will produce attempts !

For indeed self @-@ preservation being such a law of Nature , what can a
rallied Court do , but attempt and endeavour , or call it plot , -- with such
wisdom and unwisdom as it has ? They will fly , escorted , to Metz ,
where brave Bouille commands ; they will raise the Royal Standard : the
Bond @-@ signatures shall become armed men . Were not the King so
languid ! Their Bond , if at all signed , must be signed without his
privity . -- Unhappy King , he has but one resolution : not to have a civil
war . For the rest , he still hunts , having ceased lockmaking ; he still
dozes , and digests ; is clay in the hands of the potter . Ill will it fare
with him , in a world where all is helping itself ; where , as has been
written , &apos; whosoever is not hammer must be stithy ; &apos; and &apos; the very hyssop
on the wall grows there , in that chink , because the whole Universe could
not prevent its growing ! &apos;

But as for the coming up of this Regiment de Flandre , may it not be
urged that there were Saint @-@ Huruge Petitions , and continual meal @-@ mobs ?
Undebauched Soldiers , be there plot , or only dim elements of a plot , are
always good . Did not the Versailles Municipality ( an old Monarchic one ,
not yet refounded into a Democratic ) instantly second the proposal ? Nay
the very Versailles National Guard , wearied with continual duty at
the Chateau , did not object ; only Draper Lecointre , who is now Major
Lecointre , shook his head . -- Yes , Friends , surely it was natural this
Regiment de Flandre should be sent for , since it could be got . It was
natural that , at sight of military bandoleers , the heart of the rallied
Oeil @-@ de @-@ Boeuf should revive ; and Maids of Honour , and gentlemen of
honour , speak comfortable words to epauletted defenders , and to one
another . Natural also , and mere common civility , that the Bodyguards , a
Regiment of Gentlemen , should invite their Flandre brethren to a Dinner
of welcome ! -- Such invitation , in the last days of September , is given
and accepted .

Dinners are defined as &apos; the ultimate act of communion ; &apos; men that can
have communion in nothing else , can sympathetically eat together , can
still rise into some glow of brotherhood over food and wine . The dinner
is fixed on , for Thursday the First of October ; and ought to have a fine
effect . Further , as such Dinner may be rather extensive , and even the
Noncommissioned and the Common man be introduced , to see and to hear ,
could not His Majesty &apos;s Opera Apartment , which has lain quite silent
ever since Kaiser Joseph was here , be obtained for the purpose ? -- The
Hall of the Opera is granted ; the Salon d &apos;Hercule shall be drawingroom .
Not only the Officers of Flandre , but of the Swiss , of the Hundred
Swiss , nay of the Versailles National Guard , such of them as have any
loyalty , shall feast : it will be a Repast like few .

And now suppose this Repast , the solid part of it , transacted ; and the
first bottle over . Suppose the customary loyal toasts drunk ; the
King &apos;s health , the Queen &apos;s with deafening vivats ; -- that of the
Nation &apos; omitted , &apos; or even &apos; rejected . &apos; Suppose champagne flowing ; with
pot @-@ valorous speech , with instrumental music ; empty feathered heads
growing ever the noisier , in their own emptiness , in each other &apos;s noise !
Her Majesty , who looks unusually sad to @-@ night ( his Majesty sitting
dulled with the day &apos;s hunting ) , is told that the sight of it would cheer
her . Behold ! She enters there , issuing from her State @-@ rooms , like
the Moon from the clouds , this fairest unhappy Queen of Hearts ; royal
Husband by her side , young Dauphin in her arms ! She descends from the
Boxes , amid splendour and acclaim ; walks queen @-@ like , round the Tables ;
gracefully escorted , gracefully nodding ; her looks full of sorrow , yet
of gratitude and daring , with the hope of France on her mother @-@ bosom !
And now , the band striking up , O Richard , O mon Roi , l &apos;univers
t &apos;abandonne ( O Richard , O my King , and world is all forsaking
thee ) -- could man do other than rise to height of pity , of loyal valour ?
Could featherheaded young ensigns do other than , by white Bourbon
Cockades , handed them from fair fingers ; by waving of swords , drawn to
pledge the Queen &apos;s health ; by trampling of National Cockades ; by
scaling the Boxes , whence intrusive murmurs may come ; by vociferation ,
tripudiation , sound , fury and distraction , within doors and
without , -- testify what tempest @-@ tost state of vacuity they are in ?
Till champagne and tripudiation do their work ; and all lie silent ,
horizontal ; passively slumbering , with meed @-@ of @-@ battle dreams ! --

A natural Repast , in ordinary times , a harmless one : now fatal , as that
of Thyestes ; as that of Job &apos;s Sons , when a strong wind smote the four
corners of their banquet @-@ house ! Poor ill @-@ advised Marie @-@ Antoinette ;
with a woman &apos;s vehemence , not with a sovereign &apos;s foresight ! It was so
natural , yet so unwise . Next day , in public speech of ceremony , her
Majesty declares herself &apos; delighted with the Thursday . &apos; 

The heart of the Oeil @-@ de @-@ Boeuf glows into hope ; into daring , which
is premature . Rallied Maids of Honour , waited on by Abbes , sew &apos; white
cockades ; &apos; distribute them , with words , with glances , to epauletted
youths ; who in return , may kiss , not without fervour , the fair sewing
fingers . Captains of horse and foot go swashing with &apos; enormous white
cockades ; &apos; nay one Versailles National Captain had mounted the like , so
witching were the words and glances ; and laid aside his tricolor ! Well
may Major Lecointre shake his head with a look of severity ; and speak
audible resentful words . But now a swashbuckler , with enormous white
cockade , overhearing the Major , invites him insolently , once and then
again elsewhere , to recant ; and failing that , to duel . Which latter feat
Major Lecointre declares that he will not perform , not at least by any
known laws of fence ; that he nevertheless will , according to mere law of
Nature , by dirk and blade , &apos; exterminate &apos; any &apos; vile gladiator , &apos; who may
insult him or the Nation ; -- whereupon ( for the Major is actually drawing
his implement ) &apos; they are parted , &apos; and no weasands slit . ( Moniteur ( in
Histoire Parlementaire , iii . 59 ) ; Deux Amis ( iii . 128 @-@ 141 ) ; Campan ( ii .

Chapter 1.7.III.

Black Cockades .

But fancy what effect this Thyestes Repast and trampling on the National
Cockade , must have had in the Salle des Menus ; in the famishing
Bakers &apos; -queues at Paris ! Nay such Thyestes Repasts , it would seem ,
continue . Flandre has given its Counter @-@ Dinner to the Swiss and Hundred
Swiss ; then on Saturday there has been another .

Yes , here with us is famine ; but yonder at Versailles is food ; enough
and to spare ! Patriotism stands in queue , shivering hungerstruck ,
insulted by Patrollotism ; while bloodyminded Aristocrats , heated with
excess of high living , trample on the National Cockade . Can the atrocity
be true ? Nay , look : green uniforms faced with red ; black cockades , -- the
colour of Night ! Are we to have military onfall ; and death also by
starvation ? For behold the Corbeil Cornboat , which used to come twice
a @-@ day , with its Plaster @-@ of @-@ Paris meal , now comes only once . And the
Townhall is deaf ; and the men are laggard and dastard ! -- At the Cafe de
Foy , this Saturday evening , a new thing is seen , not the last of its
kind : a woman engaged in public speaking . Her poor man , she says , was
put to silence by his District ; their Presidents and Officials would
not let him speak . Wherefore she here with her shrill tongue will
speak ; denouncing , while her breath endures , the Corbeil @-@ Boat , the
Plaster @-@ of @-@ Paris bread , sacrilegious Opera @-@ dinners , green uniforms ,
Pirate Aristocrats , and those black cockades of theirs ! --

Truly , it is time for the black cockades at least , to vanish . Them
Patrollotism itself will not protect . Nay , sharp @-@ tempered &apos; M. Tassin , &apos;
at the Tuileries parade on Sunday morning , forgets all National military
rule ; starts from the ranks , wrenches down one black cockade which
is swashing ominous there ; and tramples it fiercely into the soil of
France . Patrollotism itself is not without suppressed fury . Also the
Districts begin to stir ; the voice of President Danton reverberates in
the Cordeliers : People &apos;s @-@ Friend Marat has flown to Versailles and back
again ; -- swart bird , not of the halcyon kind ! ( Camille &apos;s Newspaper ,
Revolutions de Paris et de Brabant in Histoire Parlementaire , iii .
108 . )

And so Patriot meets promenading Patriot , this Sunday ; and sees his
own grim care reflected on the face of another . Groups , in spite of
Patrollotism , which is not so alert as usual , fluctuate deliberative :
groups on the Bridges , on the Quais , at the patriotic Cafes . And ever
as any black cockade may emerge , rises the many @-@ voiced growl and bark : A
bas , Down ! All black cockades are ruthlessly plucked off : one individual
picks his up again ; kisses it , attempts to refix it ; but a &apos; hundred
canes start into the air , &apos; and he desists . Still worse went it with
another individual ; doomed , by extempore Plebiscitum , to the Lanterne ;
saved , with difficulty , by some active Corps @-@ de @-@ Garde . -- Lafayette sees
signs of an effervescence ; which he doubles his Patrols , doubles his
diligence , to prevent . So passes Sunday , the 4th of October 1789 .

Sullen is the male heart , repressed by Patrollotism ; vehement is the
female , irrepressible . The public @-@ speaking woman at the Palais Royal
was not the only speaking one : -- Men know not what the pantry is , when
it grows empty , only house @-@ mothers know . O women , wives of men that
will only calculate and not act ! Patrollotism is strong ; but Death , by
starvation and military onfall , is stronger . Patrollotism represses male
Patriotism : but female Patriotism ? Will Guards named National thrust
their bayonets into the bosoms of women ? Such thought , or rather such
dim unshaped raw @-@ material of a thought , ferments universally under
the female night @-@ cap ; and , by earliest daybreak , on slight hint , will
explode .



Chapter 1.7.IV.

The Menads .

If Voltaire once , in splenetic humour , asked his countrymen : &quot; But you ,
Gualches , what have you invented ? &quot; they can now answer : The Art of
Insurrection . It was an art needed in these last singular times : an art ,
for which the French nature , so full of vehemence , so free from depth ,
was perhaps of all others the fittest .

Accordingly , to what a height , one may well say of perfection , has
this branch of human industry been carried by France , within the last
half @-@ century ! Insurrection , which , Lafayette thought , might be &apos; the most
sacred of duties , &apos; ranks now , for the French people , among the duties
which they can perform . Other mobs are dull masses ; which roll
onwards with a dull fierce tenacity , a dull fierce heat , but emit no
light @-@ flashes of genius as they go . The French mob , again , is among the
liveliest phenomena of our world . So rapid , audacious ; so clear @-@ sighted ,
inventive , prompt to seize the moment ; instinct with life to its
finger @-@ ends ! That talent , were there no other , of spontaneously standing
in queue , distinguishes , as we said , the French People from all Peoples ,
ancient and modern .

Let the Reader confess too that , taking one thing with another , perhaps
few terrestrial Appearances are better worth considering than mobs .
Your mob is a genuine outburst of Nature ; issuing from , or communicating
with , the deepest deep of Nature . When so much goes grinning and
grimacing as a lifeless Formality , and under the stiff buckram no heart
can be felt beating , here once more , if nowhere else , is a Sincerity
and Reality . Shudder at it ; or even shriek over it , if thou must ;
nevertheless consider it . Such a Complex of human Forces and
Individualities hurled forth , in their transcendental mood , to act and
react , on circumstances and on one another ; to work out what it is in
them to work . The thing they will do is known to no man ; least of all to
themselves . It is the inflammablest immeasurable Fire @-@ work , generating ,
consuming itself . With what phases , to what extent , with what results it
will burn off , Philosophy and Perspicacity conjecture in vain .

&apos;Man , &apos; as has been written , &apos; is for ever interesting to man ; nay
properly there is nothing else interesting . &apos; In which light also , may we
not discern why most Battles have become so wearisome ? Battles , in
these ages , are transacted by mechanism ; with the slightest possible
developement of human individuality or spontaneity : men now even die ,
and kill one another , in an artificial manner . Battles ever since
Homer &apos;s time , when they were Fighting Mobs , have mostly ceased to be
worth looking at , worth reading of , or remembering . How many wearisome
bloody Battles does History strive to represent ; or even , in a husky
way , to sing : -- and she would omit or carelessly slur @-@ over this one
Insurrection of Women ?

A thought , or dim raw @-@ material of a thought , was fermenting all night ,
universally in the female head , and might explode . In squalid garret ,
on Monday morning , Maternity awakes , to hear children weeping for
bread . Maternity must forth to the streets , to the herb @-@ markets
and Bakers &apos; -- queues ; meets there with hunger @-@ stricken Maternity ,
sympathetic , exasperative . O we unhappy women ! But , instead of
Bakers &apos; -queues , why not to Aristocrats &apos; palaces , the root of the matter ?
Allons ! Let us assemble . To the Hotel @-@ de @-@ Ville ; to Versailles ; to the
Lanterne !

In one of the Guardhouses of the Quartier Saint @-@ Eustache , &apos; a young
woman &apos; seizes a drum , -- for how shall National Guards give fire on women ,
on a young woman ? The young woman seizes the drum ; sets forth , beating
it , &apos; uttering cries relative to the dearth of grains . &apos; Descend , O
mothers ; descend , ye Judiths , to food and revenge ! -- All women gather
and go ; crowds storm all stairs , force out all women : the female
Insurrectionary Force , according to Camille , resembles the English Naval
one ; there is a universal &apos; Press of women . &apos; Robust Dames of the Halle ,
slim Mantua @-@ makers , assiduous , risen with the dawn ; ancient Virginity
tripping to matins ; the Housemaid , with early broom ; all must go . Rouse
ye , O women ; the laggard men will not act ; they say , we ourselves may
act !

And so , like snowbreak from the mountains , for every staircase is
a melted brook , it storms ; tumultuous , wild @-@ shrilling , towards the
Hotel @-@ de @-@ Ville . Tumultuous , with or without drum @-@ music : for the Faubourg
Saint @-@ Antoine also has tucked up its gown ; and , with besom @-@ staves ,
fire @-@ irons , and even rusty pistols ( void of ammunition ) , is flowing on .
Sound of it flies , with a velocity of sound , to the outmost Barriers .
By seven o &apos;clock , on this raw October morning , fifth of the month , the
Townhall will see wonders . Nay , as chance would have it , a male party
are already there ; clustering tumultuously round some National Patrol ,
and a Baker who has been seized with short weights . They are there ; and
have even lowered the rope of the Lanterne . So that the official persons
have to smuggle forth the short @-@ weighing Baker by back doors , and even
send &apos; to all the Districts &apos; for more force .

Grand it was , says Camille , to see so many Judiths , from eight to ten
thousand of them in all , rushing out to search into the root of the
matter ! Not unfrightful it must have been ; ludicro @-@ terrific , and most
unmanageable . At such hour the overwatched Three Hundred are not yet
stirring : none but some Clerks , a company of National Guards ; and M. de
Gouvion , the Major @-@ general . Gouvion has fought in America for the cause
of civil Liberty ; a man of no inconsiderable heart , but deficient in
head . He is , for the moment , in his back apartment ; assuaging Usher
Maillard , the Bastille @-@ serjeant , who has come , as too many do , with
&apos;representations . &apos; The assuagement is still incomplete when our Judiths
arrive .

The National Guards form on the outer stairs , with levelled bayonets ;
the ten thousand Judiths press up , resistless ; with obtestations , with
outspread hands , -- merely to speak to the Mayor . The rear forces them ;
nay , from male hands in the rear , stones already fly : the National
Guards must do one of two things ; sweep the Place de Greve with cannon ,
or else open to right and left . They open ; the living deluge rushes in .
Through all rooms and cabinets , upwards to the topmost belfry : ravenous ;
seeking arms , seeking Mayors , seeking justice ; -- while , again , the
better @-@ cressed ( dressed ? ) speak kindly to the Clerks ; point out the
misery of these poor women ; also their ailments , some even of an
interesting sort . ( Deux Amis , iii . 141 @-@ 166 . )

Poor M. de Gouvion is shiftless in this extremity ; -- a man shiftless ,
perturbed ; who will one day commit suicide . How happy for him that
Usher Maillard , the shifty , was there , at the moment , though making
representations ! Fly back , thou shifty Maillard ; seek the Bastille
Company ; and O return fast with it ; above all , with thy own shifty head !
For , behold , the Judiths can find no Mayor or Municipal ; scarcely ,
in the topmost belfry , can they find poor Abbe Lefevre the
Powder @-@ distributor . Him , for want of a better , they suspend there ; in
the pale morning light ; over the top of all Paris , which swims in one &apos;s
failing eyes : -- a horrible end ? Nay , the rope broke , as French ropes
often did ; or else an Amazon cut it . Abbe Lefevre falls , some twenty
feet , rattling among the leads ; and lives long years after , though
always with &apos; a tremblement in the limbs . &apos; ( Dusaulx , Prise de la Bastille
( note , p . 281 . ) . )

And now doors fly under hatchets ; the Judiths have broken the Armoury ;
have seized guns and cannons , three money @-@ bags , paper @-@ heaps ; torches
flare : in few minutes , our brave Hotel @-@ de @-@ Ville which dates from the
Fourth Henry , will , with all that it holds , be in flames !



Chapter 1.7.V.

Usher Maillard .

In flames , truly , -- were it not that Usher Maillard , swift of foot ,
shifty of head , has returned !

Maillard , of his own motion , for Gouvion or the rest would not even
sanction him , -- snatches a drum ; descends the Porch @-@ stairs , ran @-@ tan ,
beating sharp , with loud rolls , his Rogues &apos; -march : To Versailles !
Allons ; a Versailles ! As men beat on kettle or warmingpan , when angry
she @-@ bees , or say , flying desperate wasps , are to be hived ; and the
desperate insects hear it , and cluster round it , -- simply as round
a guidance , where there was none : so now these Menads round shifty
Maillard , Riding @-@ Usher of the Chatelet . The axe pauses uplifted ; Abbe
Lefevre is left half @-@ hanged ; from the belfry downwards all vomits
itself . What rub @-@ a @-@ dub is that ? Stanislas Maillard , Bastille @-@ hero , will
lead us to Versailles ? Joy to thee , Maillard ; blessed art thou above
Riding @-@ Ushers ! Away then , away !

The seized cannon are yoked with seized cart @-@ horses : brown @-@ locked
Demoiselle Theroigne , with pike and helmet , sits there as gunneress ,
&apos;with haughty eye and serene fair countenance ; &apos; comparable , some think ,
to the Maid of Orleans , or even recalling &apos; the idea of Pallas Athene . &apos; 
( Deux Amis , iii . 157 . ) Maillard ( for his drum still rolls ) is , by
heaven @-@ rending acclamation , admitted General . Maillard hastens the
languid march . Maillard , beating rhythmic , with sharp ran @-@ tan , all
along the Quais , leads forward , with difficulty his Menadic host . Such
a host -- marched not in silence ! The bargeman pauses on the River ; all
wagoners and coachdrivers fly ; men peer from windows , -- not women ,
lest they be pressed . Sight of sights : Bacchantes , in these ultimate
Formalized Ages ! Bronze Henri looks on , from his Pont @-@ Neuf ; the
Monarchic Louvre , Medicean Tuileries see a day not theretofore seen .

And now Maillard has his Menads in the Champs Elysees ( Fields Tartarean
rather ) ; and the Hotel @-@ de @-@ Ville has suffered comparatively nothing .
Broken doors ; an Abbe Lefevre , who shall never more distribute powder ;
three sacks of money , most part of which ( for Sansculottism , though
famishing , is not without honour ) shall be returned : ( Hist . Parl. iii .
310 . ) this is all the damage . Great Maillard ! A small nucleus of Order
is round his drum ; but his outskirts fluctuate like the mad Ocean : for
Rascality male and female is flowing in on him , from the four winds ;
guidance there is none but in his single head and two drumsticks .

O Maillard , when , since War first was , had General of Force such a task
before him , as thou this day ? Walter the Penniless still touches the
feeling heart : but then Walter had sanction ; had space to turn in ; and
also his Crusaders were of the male sex . Thou , this day , disowned of
Heaven and Earth , art General of Menads . Their inarticulate frenzy thou
must on the spur of the instant , render into articulate words , into
actions that are not frantic . Fail in it , this way or that ! Pragmatical
Officiality , with its penalties and law @-@ books , waits before thee ; Menads
storm behind . If such hewed off the melodious head of Orpheus , and
hurled it into the Peneus waters , what may they not make of thee , -- thee
rhythmic merely , with no music but a sheepskin drum ! -- Maillard did not
fail . Remarkable Maillard , if fame were not an accident , and History a
distillation of Rumour , how remarkable wert thou !

On the Elysian Fields , there is pause and fluctuation ; but , for
Maillard , no return . He persuades his Menads , clamorous for arms and the
Arsenal , that no arms are in the Arsenal ; that an unarmed attitude , and
petition to a National Assembly , will be the best : he hastily nominates
or sanctions generalesses , captains of tens and fifties ; -- and so , in
loosest @-@ flowing order , to the rhythm of some &apos; eight drums &apos; ( having laid
aside his own ) , with the Bastille Volunteers bringing up his rear , once
more takes the road .

Chaillot , which will promptly yield baked loaves , is not plundered ; nor
are the Sevres Potteries broken . The old arches of Sevres Bridge echo
under Menadic feet ; Seine River gushes on with his perpetual murmur ; and
Paris flings after us the boom of tocsin and alarm @-@ drum , -- inaudible ,
for the present , amid shrill @-@ sounding hosts , and the splash of rainy
weather . To Meudon , to Saint Cloud , on both hands , the report of them is
gone abroad ; and hearths , this evening , will have a topic . The press
of women still continues , for it is the cause of all Eve &apos;s Daughters ,
mothers that are , or that hope to be . No carriage @-@ lady , were it with
never such hysterics , but must dismount , in the mud roads , in her
silk shoes , and walk . ( Deux Amis , iii . 159 . ) In this manner , amid
wild October weather , they a wild unwinged stork @-@ flight , through the
astonished country , wend their way . Travellers of all sorts they stop ;
especially travellers or couriers from Paris . Deputy Lechapelier , in his
elegant vesture , from his elegant vehicle , looks forth amazed through
his spectacles ; apprehensive for life ; -- states eagerly that he is
Patriot @-@ Deputy Lechapelier , and even Old @-@ President Lechapelier , who
presided on the Night of Pentecost , and is original member of the Breton
Club . Thereupon &apos; rises huge shout of Vive Lechapelier , and several armed
persons spring up behind and before to escort him . &apos; ( Ibid. iii . 177 ;
Dictionnaire des Hommes Marquans , ii . 379 . )

Nevertheless , news , despatches from Lafayette , or vague noise of rumour ,
have pierced through , by side roads . In the National Assembly , while all
is busy discussing the order of the day ; regretting that there should
be Anti @-@ national Repasts in Opera @-@ Halls ; that his Majesty should still
hesitate about accepting the Rights of Man , and hang conditions and
peradventures on them , -- Mirabeau steps up to the President , experienced
Mounier as it chanced to be ; and articulates , in bass under @-@ tone :
&quot; Mounier , Paris marche sur nous ( Paris is marching on us ) . &quot; -- &quot; May be ( Je
n &apos;en sais rien ) ! &quot; -- &quot; Believe it or disbelieve it , that is not my concern ;
but Paris , I say , is marching on us . Fall suddenly unwell ; go over to
the Chateau ; tell them this . There is not a moment to lose . &quot; -- &quot; Paris
marching on us ? &quot; responds Mounier , with an atrabiliar accent , &quot; Well , so
much the better ! We shall the sooner be a Republic . &quot; Mirabeau quits
him , as one quits an experienced President getting blindfold into deep
waters ; and the order of the day continues as before .

Yes , Paris is marching on us ; and more than the women of Paris ! Scarcely
was Maillard gone , when M. de Gouvion &apos;s message to all the Districts ,
and such tocsin and drumming of the generale , began to take effect .
Armed National Guards from every District ; especially the Grenadiers
of the Centre , who are our old Gardes Francaises , arrive , in quick
sequence , on the Place de Greve . An &apos; immense people &apos; is there ;
Saint @-@ Antoine , with pike and rusty firelock , is all crowding thither ,
be it welcome or unwelcome . The Centre Grenadiers are received with
cheering : &quot; it is not cheers that we want , &quot; answer they gloomily ; &quot; the
nation has been insulted ; to arms , and come with us for orders ! &quot; Ha ,
sits the wind so ? Patriotism and Patrollotism are now one !

The Three Hundred have assembled ; &apos; all the Committees are in activity ; &apos;
Lafayette is dictating despatches for Versailles , when a Deputation of
the Centre Grenadiers introduces itself to him . The Deputation makes
military obeisance ; and thus speaks , not without a kind of thought in
it : &quot; Mon General , we are deputed by the Six Companies of Grenadiers . We
do not think you a traitor , but we think the Government betrays you ; it
is time that this end . We cannot turn our bayonets against women crying
to us for bread . The people are miserable , the source of the mischief is
at Versailles : we must go seek the King , and bring him to Paris . We
must exterminate ( exterminer ) the Regiment de Flandre and the
Gardes @-@ du @-@ Corps , who have dared to trample on the National Cockade . If
the King be too weak to wear his crown , let him lay it down . You will
crown his Son , you will name a Council of Regency ; and all will go
better . &quot; ( Deux Amis , iii . 161 . ) Reproachful astonishment paints itself
on the face of Lafayette ; speaks itself from his eloquent chivalrous
lips : in vain . &quot; My General , we would shed the last drop of our blood for
you ; but the root of the mischief is at Versailles ; we must go and bring
the King to Paris ; all the people wish it , tout le peuple le veut . &quot;

My General descends to the outer staircase ; and harangues : once more
in vain . &quot; To Versailles ! To Versailles ! &quot; Mayor Bailly , sent for through
floods of Sansculottism , attempts academic oratory from his gilt
state @-@ coach ; realizes nothing but infinite hoarse cries of : &quot; Bread !
To Versailles ! &quot; -- and gladly shrinks within doors . Lafayette mounts the
white charger ; and again harangues and reharangues : with eloquence , with
firmness , indignant demonstration ; with all things but persuasion . &quot; To
Versailles ! To Versailles ! &quot; So lasts it , hour after hour ; for the space
of half a day .

The great Scipio Americanus can do nothing ; not so much as escape .
&quot; Morbleu , mon General , &quot; cry the Grenadiers serrying their ranks as the
white charger makes a motion that way , &quot; You will not leave us , you will
abide with us ! &quot; A perilous juncture : Mayor Bailly and the Municipals
sit quaking within doors ; My General is prisoner without : the Place
de Greve , with its thirty thousand Regulars , its whole irregular
Saint @-@ Antoine and Saint @-@ Marceau , is one minatory mass of clear or rusty
steel ; all hearts set , with a moody fixedness , on one object . Moody ,
fixed are all hearts : tranquil is no heart , -- if it be not that of the
white charger , who paws there , with arched neck , composedly champing his
bit ; as if no world , with its Dynasties and Eras , were now rushing down .
The drizzly day tends westward ; the cry is still : &quot; To Versailles ! &quot;

Nay now , borne from afar , come quite sinister cries ; hoarse ,
reverberating in longdrawn hollow murmurs , with syllables too like those
of Lanterne ! Or else , irregular Sansculottism may be marching off ,
of itself ; with pikes , nay with cannon . The inflexible Scipio does at
length , by aide @-@ de @-@ camp , ask of the Municipals : Whether or not he may
go ? A Letter is handed out to him , over armed heads ; sixty thousand
faces flash fixedly on his , there is stillness and no bosom breathes ,
till he have read . By Heaven , he grows suddenly pale ! Do the Municipals
permit ? &apos; Permit and even order , &apos; -- since he can no other . Clangour of
approval rends the welkin . To your ranks , then ; let us march !

It is , as we compute , towards three in the afternoon . Indignant National
Guards may dine for once from their haversack : dined or undined , they
march with one heart . Paris flings up her windows , claps hands , as the
Avengers , with their shrilling drums and shalms tramp by ; she will then
sit pensive , apprehensive , and pass rather a sleepless night . ( Deux
Amis , iii . 165 . ) On the white charger , Lafayette , in the slowest
possible manner , going and coming , and eloquently haranguing among the
ranks , rolls onward with his thirty thousand . Saint @-@ Antoine , with pike
and cannon , has preceded him ; a mixed multitude , of all and of no arms ,
hovers on his flanks and skirts ; the country once more pauses agape :
Paris marche sur nous .



Chapter 1.7.VI.

To Versailles .

For , indeed , about this same moment , Maillard has halted his draggled
Menads on the last hill @-@ top ; and now Versailles , and the Chateau of
Versailles , and far and wide the inheritance of Royalty opens to
the wondering eye . From far on the right , over Marly and
Saint @-@ Germains @-@ en @-@ Laye ; round towards Rambouillet , on the left :
beautiful all ; softly embosomed ; as if in sadness , in the dim moist
weather ! And near before us is Versailles , New and Old ; with that broad
frondent Avenue de Versailles between , -- stately @-@ frondent , broad , three
hundred feet as men reckon , with four Rows of Elms ; and then the Chateau
de Versailles , ending in royal Parks and Pleasances , gleaming lakelets ,
arbours , Labyrinths , the Menagerie , and Great and Little Trianon .
High @-@ towered dwellings , leafy pleasant places ; where the gods of this
lower world abide : whence , nevertheless , black Care cannot be excluded ;
whither Menadic Hunger is even now advancing , armed with pike @-@ thyrsi !

Yes , yonder , Mesdames , where our straight frondent Avenue , joined , as
you note , by Two frondent brother Avenues from this hand and from that ,
spreads out into Place Royale and Palace Forecourt ; yonder is the
Salle des Menus . Yonder an august Assembly sits regenerating France .
Forecourt , Grand Court , Court of Marble , Court narrowing into Court
you may discern next , or fancy : on the extreme verge of which
that glass @-@ dome , visibly glittering like a star of hope , is
the -- Oeil @-@ de @-@ Boeuf ! Yonder , or nowhere in the world , is bread baked for
us . But , O Mesdames , were not one thing good : That our cannons , with
Demoiselle Theroigne and all show of war , be put to the rear ? Submission
beseems petitioners of a National Assembly ; we are strangers in
Versailles , -- whence , too audibly , there comes even now sound as
of tocsin and generale ! Also to put on , if possible , a cheerful
countenance , hiding our sorrows ; and even to sing ? Sorrow , pitied of
the Heavens , is hateful , suspicious to the Earth . -- So counsels shifty
Maillard ; haranguing his Menads , on the heights near Versailles . ( See
Hist . Parl. iii . 70 @-@ 117 ; Deux Amis , iii . 166 @-@ 177 , &amp; c . )

Cunning Maillard &apos;s dispositions are obeyed . The draggled
Insurrectionists advance up the Avenue , &apos; in three columns , among the
four Elm @-@ rows ; &apos; singing Henri Quatre , &apos; with what melody they can ; and
shouting Vive le Roi . Versailles , though the Elm @-@ rows are dripping wet ,
crowds from both sides , with : &quot; Vivent nos Parisiennes , Our Paris ones
for ever ! &quot;

Prickers , scouts have been out towards Paris , as the rumour deepened :
whereby his Majesty , gone to shoot in the Woods of Meudon , has been
happily discovered , and got home ; and the generale and tocsin set
a @-@ sounding . The Bodyguards are already drawn up in front of the Palace
Grates ; and look down the Avenue de Versailles ; sulky , in wet buckskins .
Flandre too is there , repentant of the Opera @-@ Repast . Also Dragoons
dismounted are there . Finally Major Lecointre , and what he can gather
of the Versailles National Guard ; though , it is to be observed , our
Colonel , that same sleepless Count d &apos;Estaing , giving neither order
nor ammunition , has vanished most improperly ; one supposes , into the
Oeil @-@ de @-@ Boeuf . Red @-@ coated Swiss stand within the Grates , under arms .
There likewise , in their inner room , &apos; all the Ministers , &apos; Saint @-@ Priest ,
Lamentation Pompignan and the rest , are assembled with M. Necker : they
sit with him there ; blank , expecting what the hour will bring .

President Mounier , though he answered Mirabeau with a tant mieux , and
affected to slight the matter , had his own forebodings . Surely , for
these four weary hours , he has reclined not on roses ! The order of the
day is getting forward : a Deputation to his Majesty seems proper , that
it might please him to grant &apos; Acceptance pure and simple &apos; to those
Constitution @-@ Articles of ours ; the &apos; mixed qualified Acceptance , &apos; with
its peradventures , is satisfactory to neither gods nor men .

So much is clear . And yet there is more , which no man speaks , which all
men now vaguely understand . Disquietude , absence of mind is on every
face ; Members whisper , uneasily come and go : the order of the day is
evidently not the day &apos;s want . Till at length , from the outer gates , is
heard a rustling and justling , shrill uproar and squabbling , muffled by
walls ; which testifies that the hour is come ! Rushing and crushing one
hears now ; then enter Usher Maillard , with a Deputation of Fifteen
muddy dripping Women , -- having by incredible industry , and aid of all the
macers , persuaded the rest to wait out of doors . National Assembly shall
now , therefore , look its august task directly in the face : regenerative
Constitutionalism has an unregenerate Sansculottism bodily in front of
it ; crying , &quot; Bread ! Bread ! &quot;

Shifty Maillard , translating frenzy into articulation ; repressive with
the one hand , expostulative with the other , does his best ; and really ,
though not bred to public speaking , manages rather well : -- In the present
dreadful rarity of grains , a Deputation of Female Citizens has , as the
august Assembly can discern , come out from Paris to petition . Plots of
Aristocrats are too evident in the matter ; for example , one miller has
been bribed &apos; by a banknote of 200 livres &apos; not to grind , -- name unknown to
the Usher , but fact provable , at least indubitable . Further , it
seems , the National Cockade has been trampled on ; also there are
Black Cockades , or were . All which things will not an august
National Assembly , the hope of France , take into its wise immediate
consideration ?

And Menadic Hunger , impressible , crying &quot; Black Cockades , &quot; crying &quot; Bread ,
Bread , &quot; adds , after such fashion : &quot; Will it not ? -- Yes , Messieurs , if a
Deputation to his Majesty , for the &apos; Acceptance pure and simple , &apos; seemed
proper , -- how much more now , for &apos; the afflicting situation of Paris ; &apos;
for the calming of this effervescence ! &quot; President Mounier , with a speedy
Deputation , among whom we notice the respectable figure of Doctor
Guillotin , gets himself forthwith on march . Vice @-@ President shall
continue the order of the day ; Usher Maillard shall stay by him to
repress the women . It is four o &apos;clock , of the miserablest afternoon ,
when Mounier steps out .

O experienced Mounier , what an afternoon ; the last of thy political
existence ! Better had it been to &apos; fall suddenly unwell , &apos; while it was
yet time . For , behold , the Esplanade , over all its spacious expanse ,
is covered with groups of squalid dripping Women ; of lankhaired male
Rascality , armed with axes , rusty pikes , old muskets , ironshod clubs
( baton ferres , which end in knives or sword @-@ blades , a kind of extempore
billhook ) ; -- looking nothing but hungry revolt . The rain pours :
Gardes @-@ du @-@ Corps go caracoling through the groups &apos; amid hisses ; &apos;
irritating and agitating what is but dispersed here to reunite there .

Innumerable squalid women beleaguer the President and Deputation ; insist
on going with him : has not his Majesty himself , looking from the window ,
sent out to ask , What we wanted ? &quot; Bread and speech with the King
( Du pain , et parler au Roi ) , &quot; that was the answer . Twelve women are
clamorously added to the Deputation ; and march with it , across the
Esplanade ; through dissipated groups , caracoling Bodyguards , and the
pouring rain .

President Mounier , unexpectedly augmented by Twelve Women , copiously
escorted by Hunger and Rascality , is himself mistaken for a group :
himself and his Women are dispersed by caracolers ; rally again with
difficulty , among the mud . ( Mounier , Expose Justificatif ( cited in Deux
Amis , iii . 185 ) . ) Finally the Grates are opened : the Deputation gets
access , with the Twelve Women too in it ; of which latter , Five shall
even see the face of his Majesty . Let wet Menadism , in the best spirits
it can expect their return .



Chapter 1.7.VII.

At Versailles .

But already Pallas Athene ( in the shape of Demoiselle Theroigne ) is busy
with Flandre and the dismounted Dragoons . She , and such women as are
fittest , go through the ranks ; speak with an earnest jocosity ; clasp
rough troopers to their patriot bosom , crush down spontoons and
musketoons with soft arms : can a man , that were worthy of the name of
man , attack famishing patriot women ?

One reads that Theroigne had bags of money , which she distributed over
Flandre : -- furnished by whom ? Alas , with money @-@ bags one seldom sits on
insurrectionary cannon . Calumnious Royalism ! Theroigne had only the
limited earnings of her profession of unfortunate @-@ female ; money she had
not , but brown locks , the figure of a heathen Goddess , and an eloquent
tongue and heart .

Meanwhile , Saint @-@ Antoine , in groups and troops , is continually arriving ;
wetted , sulky ; with pikes and impromptu billhooks : driven thus far
by popular fixed @-@ idea . So many hirsute figures driven hither , in that
manner : figures that have come to do they know not what ; figures that
have come to see it done ! Distinguished among all figures , who is this ,
of gaunt stature , with leaden breastplate , though a small one ; ( See
Weber , ii . 185 @-@ 231 . ) bushy in red grizzled locks ; nay , with long
tile @-@ beard ? It is Jourdan , unjust dealer in mules ; a dealer no longer ,
but a Painter &apos;s Layfigure , playing truant this day . From the necessities
of Art comes his long tile @-@ beard ; whence his leaden breastplate
( unless indeed he were some Hawker licensed by leaden badge ) may have
come , -- will perhaps remain for ever a Historical Problem . Another Saul
among the people we discern : &apos; Pere Adam , Father Adam , &apos; as the groups
name him ; to us better known as bull @-@ voiced Marquis Saint @-@ Huruge ; hero
of the Veto ; a man that has had losses , and deserved them . The tall
Marquis , emitted some days ago from limbo , looks peripatetically on this
scene , from under his umbrella , not without interest . All which persons
and things , hurled together as we see ; Pallas Athene , busy with Flandre ;
patriotic Versailles National Guards , short of ammunition , and deserted
by d &apos;Estaing their Colonel , and commanded by Lecointre their Major ; then
caracoling Bodyguards , sour , dispirited , with their buckskins wet ; and
finally this flowing sea of indignant Squalor , -- may they not give rise
to occurrences ?

Behold , however , the Twelve She @-@ deputies return from the Chateau .
Without President Mounier , indeed ; but radiant with joy , shouting &quot; Life
to the King and his House . &quot; Apparently the news are good , Mesdames ? News
of the best ! Five of us were admitted to the internal splendours , to the
Royal Presence . This slim damsel , &apos; Louison Chabray , worker in sculpture ,
aged only seventeen , &apos; as being of the best looks and address , her we
appointed speaker . On whom , and indeed on all of us , his Majesty looked
nothing but graciousness . Nay , when Louison , addressing him , was like to
faint , he took her in his royal arms ; and said gallantly , &quot; It was well
worth while ( Elle en valut bien la peine ) . &quot; Consider , O women , what a
King ! His words were of comfort , and that only : there shall be provision
sent to Paris , if provision is in the world ; grains shall circulate free
as air ; millers shall grind , or do worse , while their millstones endure ;
and nothing be left wrong which a Restorer of French Liberty can right .

Good news these ; but , to wet Menads , all too incredible ! There seems no
proof , then ? Words of comfort are words only ; which will feed nothing .
O miserable people , betrayed by Aristocrats , who corrupt thy very
messengers ! In his royal arms , Mademoiselle Louison ? In his arms ? Thou
shameless minx , worthy of a name -- that shall be nameless ! Yes , thy skin
is soft : ours is rough with hardship ; and well wetted , waiting here in
the rain . No children hast thou hungry at home ; only alabaster dolls ,
that weep not ! The traitress ! To the Lanterne ! -- And so poor Louison
Chabray , no asseveration or shrieks availing her , fair slim damsel ,
late in the arms of Royalty , has a garter round her neck , and furibund
Amazons at each end ; is about to perish so , -- when two Bodyguards gallop
up , indignantly dissipating ; and rescue her . The miscredited Twelve
hasten back to the Chateau , for an &apos; answer in writing . &apos; 

Nay , behold , a new flight of Menads , with &apos; M. Brunout Bastille
Volunteer , &apos; as impressed @-@ commandant , at the head of it . These also will
advance to the Grate of the Grand Court , and see what is toward . Human
patience , in wet buckskins , has its limits . Bodyguard Lieutenant , M. de
Savonnieres , for one moment , lets his temper , long provoked , long pent ,
give way . He not only dissipates these latter Menads ; but caracoles
and cuts , or indignantly flourishes , at M. Brunout , the
impressed @-@ commandant ; and , finding great relief in it , even chases him ;
Brunout flying nimbly , though in a pirouette manner , and now with sword
also drawn . At which sight of wrath and victory two other Bodyguards
( for wrath is contagious , and to pent Bodyguards is so solacing ) do
likewise give way ; give chase , with brandished sabre , and in the air
make horrid circles . So that poor Brunout has nothing for it but
to retreat with accelerated nimbleness , through rank after rank ;
Parthian @-@ like , fencing as he flies ; above all , shouting lustily , &quot; On
nous laisse assassiner , They are getting us assassinated ? &quot;

Shameful ! Three against one ! Growls come from the Lecointrian ranks ;
bellowings , -- lastly shots . Savonnieres &apos; arm is raised to strike : the
bullet of a Lecointrian musket shatters it ; the brandished sabre jingles
down harmless . Brunout has escaped , this duel well ended : but the wild
howl of war is everywhere beginning to pipe !

The Amazons recoil ; Saint @-@ Antoine has its cannon pointed ( full of
grapeshot ) ; thrice applies the lit flambeau ; which thrice refuses to
catch , -- the touchholes are so wetted ; and voices cry : &quot; Arretez , il n &apos;est
pas temps encore , Stop , it is not yet time ! &quot; ( Deux Amis , iii . 192 @-@ 201 . )
Messieurs of the Garde @-@ du @-@ Corps , ye had orders not to fire ; nevertheless
two of you limp dismounted , and one war @-@ horse lies slain . Were it not
well to draw back out of shot @-@ range ; finally to file off , -- into the
interior ? If in so filing off , there did a musketoon or two discharge
itself , at these armed shopkeepers , hooting and crowing , could man
wonder ? Draggled are your white cockades of an enormous size ; would to
Heaven they were got exchanged for tricolor ones ! Your buckskins are
wet , your hearts heavy . Go , and return not !

The Bodyguards file off , as we hint ; giving and receiving shots ; drawing
no life @-@ blood ; leaving boundless indignation . Some three times in the
thickening dusk , a glimpse of them is seen , at this or the other Portal :
saluted always with execrations , with the whew of lead . Let but a
Bodyguard shew face , he is hunted by Rascality ; -- for instance , poor &apos; M.
de Moucheton of the Scotch Company , &apos; owner of the slain war @-@ horse ; and
has to be smuggled off by Versailles Captains . Or rusty firelocks belch
after him , shivering asunder his -- hat . In the end , by superior Order ,
the Bodyguards , all but the few on immediate duty , disappear ; or as it
were abscond ; and march , under cloud of night , to Rambouillet . ( Weber ,
ubi supra . )

We remark also that the Versaillese have now got ammunition : all
afternoon , the official Person could find none ; till , in these so
critical moments , a patriotic Sublieutenant set a pistol to his ear , and
would thank him to find some , -- which he thereupon succeeded in doing .
Likewise that Flandre , disarmed by Pallas Athene , says openly , it
will not fight with citizens ; and for token of peace , has exchanged
cartridges with the Versaillese .

Sansculottism is now among mere friends ; and can &apos; circulate freely ; &apos;
indignant at Bodyguards ; -- complaining also considerably of hunger .



Chapter 1.7.VIII.

The Equal Diet .

But why lingers Mounier ; returns not with his Deputation ? It is six , it
is seven o &apos;clock ; and still no Mounier , no Acceptance pure and simple .

And , behold , the dripping Menads , not now in deputation but in mass ,
have penetrated into the Assembly : to the shamefullest interruption
of public speaking and order of the day . Neither Maillard nor
Vice @-@ President can restrain them , except within wide limits ; not even ,
except for minutes , can the lion @-@ voice of Mirabeau , though they applaud
it : but ever and anon they break in upon the regeneration of France with
cries of : &quot; Bread ; not so much discoursing ! Du pain ; pas tant de longs
discours ! &quot; -- So insensible were these poor creatures to bursts of
Parliamentary eloquence !

One learns also that the royal Carriages are getting yoked , as if for
Metz . Carriages , royal or not , have verily showed themselves at the
back Gates . They even produced , or quoted , a written order from our
Versailles Municipality , -- which is a Monarchic not a Democratic one .
However , Versailles Patroles drove them in again ; as the vigilant
Lecointre had strictly charged them to do .

A busy man , truly , is Major Lecointre , in these hours . For Colonel
d &apos;Estaing loiters invisible in the Oeil @-@ de @-@ Boeuf ; invisible , or
still more questionably visible , for instants : then also a too loyal
Municipality requires supervision : no order , civil or military , taken
about any of these thousand things ! Lecointre is at the Versailles
Townhall : he is at the Grate of the Grand Court ; communing with Swiss
and Bodyguards . He is in the ranks of Flandre ; he is here , he is there :
studious to prevent bloodshed ; to prevent the Royal Family from flying
to Metz ; the Menads from plundering Versailles .

At the fall of night , we behold him advance to those armed groups of
Saint @-@ Antoine , hovering all @-@ too grim near the Salle des Menus . They
receive him in a half @-@ circle ; twelve speakers behind cannons , with
lighted torches in hand , the cannon @-@ mouths towards Lecointre : a picture
for Salvator ! He asks , in temperate but courageous language : What they ,
by this their journey to Versailles , do specially want ? The twelve
speakers reply , in few words inclusive of much : &quot; Bread , and the end of
these brabbles , Du pain , et la fin des affaires . &quot; When the affairs will
end , no Major Lecointre , nor no mortal , can say ; but as to bread , he
inquires , How many are you ? -- learns that they are six hundred , that a
loaf each will suffice ; and rides off to the Municipality to get six
hundred loaves .

Which loaves , however , a Municipality of Monarchic temper will not give .
It will give two tons of rice rather , -- could you but know whether it
should be boiled or raw . Nay when this too is accepted , the Municipals
have disappeared ; -- ducked under , as the Six @-@ and @-@ Twenty Long @-@ gowned of
Paris did ; and , leaving not the smallest vestage of rice , in the boiled
or raw state , they there vanish from History !

Rice comes not ; one &apos;s hope of food is baulked ; even one &apos;s hope of
vengeance : is not M. de Moucheton of the Scotch Company , as we
said , deceitfully smuggled off ? Failing all which , behold only M. de
Moucheton &apos;s slain warhorse , lying on the Esplanade there ! Saint @-@ Antoine ,
baulked , esurient , pounces on the slain warhorse ; flays it ; roasts
it , with such fuel , of paling , gates , portable timber as can be come
at , -- not without shouting : and , after the manner of ancient Greek
Heroes , they lifted their hands to the daintily readied repast ; such as
it might be . ( Weber , Deux Amis , &amp; c . ) Other Rascality prowls discursive ;
seeking what it may devour . Flandre will retire to its barracks ;
Lecointre also with his Versaillese , -- all but the vigilant Patrols ,
charged to be doubly vigilant .

So sink the shadows of Night , blustering , rainy ; and all paths grow
dark . Strangest Night ever seen in these regions , -- perhaps since the
Bartholomew Night , when Versailles , as Bassompierre writes of it , was a
chetif chateau . O for the Lyre of some Orpheus , to constrain , with touch
of melodious strings , these mad masses into Order ! For here all
seems fallen asunder , in wide @-@ yawning dislocation . The highest , as
in down @-@ rushing of a World , is come in contact with the lowest : the
Rascality of France beleaguering the Royalty of France ; &apos; ironshod
batons &apos; lifted round the diadem , not to guard it ! With denunciations of
bloodthirsty Anti @-@ national Bodyguards , are heard dark growlings against
a Queenly Name .

The Court sits tremulous , powerless ; varies with the varying temper
of the Esplanade , with the varying colour of the rumours from Paris .
Thick @-@ coming rumours ; now of peace , now of war . Necker and all the
Ministers consult ; with a blank issue . The Oeil @-@ de @-@ Boeuf is one tempest
of whispers : -- We will fly to Metz ; we will not fly . The royal Carriages
again attempt egress ; -- though for trial merely ; they are again driven in
by Lecointre &apos;s Patrols . In six hours , nothing has been resolved on ; not
even the Acceptance pure and simple .

In six hours ? Alas , he who , in such circumstances , cannot resolve in six
minutes , may give up the enterprise : him Fate has already resolved
for . And Menadism , meanwhile , and Sansculottism takes counsel with the
National Assembly ; grows more and more tumultuous there . Mounier returns
not ; Authority nowhere shews itself : the Authority of France lies ,
for the present , with Lecointre and Usher Maillard . -- This then is the
abomination of desolation ; come suddenly , though long foreshadowed as
inevitable ! For , to the blind , all things are sudden . Misery which ,
through long ages , had no spokesman , no helper , will now be its own
helper and speak for itself . The dialect , one of the rudest , is , what it
could be , this .

At eight o &apos;clock there returns to our Assembly not the Deputation ; but
Doctor Guillotin announcing that it will return ; also that there is
hope of the Acceptance pure and simple . He himself has brought a Royal
Letter , authorising and commanding the freest &apos; circulation of grains . &apos; 
Which Royal Letter Menadism with its whole heart applauds . Conformably
to which the Assembly forthwith passes a Decree ; also received with
rapturous Menadic plaudits : -- Only could not an august Assembly contrive
further to &quot; fix the price of bread at eight sous the half @-@ quartern ;
butchers &apos; -meat at six sous the pound ; &quot; which seem fair rates ? Such
motion do &apos; a multitude of men and women , &apos; irrepressible by Usher
Maillard , now make ; does an august Assembly hear made . Usher Maillard
himself is not always perfectly measured in speech ; but if rebuked ,
he can justly excuse himself by the peculiarity of the circumstances .
( Moniteur ( in Hist . Parl. ii . 105 ) . )

But finally , this Decree well passed , and the disorder continuing ; and
Members melting away , and no President Mounier returning , -- what can the
Vice @-@ President do but also melt away ? The Assembly melts , under such
pressure , into deliquium ; or , as it is officially called , adjourns .
Maillard is despatched to Paris , with the &apos; Decree concerning Grains&apos;
in his pocket ; he and some women , in carriages belonging to the King .
Thitherward slim Louison Chabray has already set forth , with that
&apos;written answer , &apos; which the Twelve She @-@ deputies returned in to seek .
Slim sylph , she has set forth , through the black muddy country : she has
much to tell , her poor nerves so flurried ; and travels , as indeed to @-@ day
on this road all persons do , with extreme slowness . President Mounier
has not come , nor the Acceptance pure and simple ; though six hours with
their events have come ; though courier on courier reports that Lafayette
is coming . Coming , with war or with peace ? It is time that the Chateau
also should determine on one thing or another ; that the Chateau also
should show itself alive , if it would continue living !

Victorious , joyful after such delay , Mounier does arrive at last , and
the hard @-@ earned Acceptance with him ; which now , alas , is of small value .
Fancy Mounier &apos;s surprise to find his Senate , whom he hoped to charm by
the Acceptance pure and simple , -- all gone ; and in its stead a Senate of
Menads ! For as Erasmus &apos;s Ape mimicked , say with wooden splint , Erasmus
shaving , so do these Amazons hold , in mock majesty , some confused
parody of National Assembly . They make motions ; deliver speeches ; pass
enactments ; productive at least of loud laughter . All galleries and
benches are filled ; a strong Dame of the Market is in Mounier &apos;s Chair .
Not without difficulty , Mounier , by aid of macers , and persuasive
speaking , makes his way to the Female @-@ President : the Strong Dame before
abdicating signifies that , for one thing , she and indeed her whole
senate male and female ( for what was one roasted warhorse among so
many ? ) are suffering very considerably from hunger .

Experienced Mounier , in these circumstances , takes a twofold resolution :
To reconvoke his Assembly Members by sound of drum ; also to procure a
supply of food . Swift messengers fly , to all bakers , cooks , pastrycooks ,
vintners , restorers ; drums beat , accompanied with shrill vocal
proclamation , through all streets . They come : the Assembly Members come ;
what is still better , the provisions come . On tray and barrow come these
latter ; loaves , wine , great store of sausages . The nourishing baskets
circulate harmoniously along the benches ; nor , according to the Father
of Epics , did any soul lack a fair share of victual ( ( Greek ) , an equal
diet ) ; highly desirable , at the moment . ( Deux Amis , iii . 208 . )

Gradually some hundred or so of Assembly members get edged in , Menadism
making way a little , round Mounier &apos;s Chair ; listen to the Acceptance
pure and simple ; and begin , what is the order of the night , &apos; discussion
of the Penal Code . &apos; All benches are crowded ; in the dusky galleries ,
duskier with unwashed heads , is a strange &apos; coruscation , &apos; -- of impromptu
billhooks . ( Courier de Provence ( Mirabeau &apos;s Newspaper ) , No. 50 , p .
19 . ) It is exactly five months this day since these same galleries were
filled with high @-@ plumed jewelled Beauty , raining bright influences ; and
now ? To such length have we got in regenerating France . Methinks the
travail @-@ throes are of the sharpest ! -- Menadism will not be restrained
from occasional remarks ; asks , &quot; What is use of the Penal Code ? The
thing we want is Bread . &quot; Mirabeau turns round with lion @-@ voiced rebuke ;
Menadism applauds him ; but recommences .

Thus they , chewing tough sausages , discussing the Penal Code , make night
hideous . What the issue will be ? Lafayette with his thirty thousand must
arrive first : him , who cannot now be distant , all men expect , as the
messenger of Destiny .



Chapter 1.7.IX.

Lafayette .

Towards midnight lights flare on the hill ; Lafayette &apos;s lights ! The roll
of his drums comes up the Avenue de Versailles . With peace , or with
war ? Patience , friends ! With neither . Lafayette is come , but not yet the
catastrophe .

He has halted and harangued so often , on the march ; spent nine hours on
four leagues of road . At Montreuil , close on Versailles , the whole Host
had to pause ; and , with uplifted right hand , in the murk of Night , to
these pouring skies , swear solemnly to respect the King &apos;s Dwelling ; to
be faithful to King and National Assembly . Rage is driven down out of
sight , by the laggard march ; the thirst of vengeance slaked in weariness
and soaking clothes . Flandre is again drawn out under arms : but Flandre ,
grown so patriotic , now needs no &apos; exterminating . &apos; The wayworn Batallions
halt in the Avenue : they have , for the present , no wish so pressing as
that of shelter and rest .

Anxious sits President Mounier ; anxious the Chateau . There is a message
coming from the Chateau , that M. Mounier would please return thither
with a fresh Deputation , swiftly ; and so at least unite our two
anxieties . Anxious Mounier does of himself send , meanwhile , to apprise
the General that his Majesty has been so gracious as to grant us the
Acceptance pure and simple . The General , with a small advance column ,
makes answer in passing ; speaks vaguely some smooth words to the
National President , -- glances , only with the eye , at that so mixtiform
National Assembly ; then fares forward towards the Chateau . There are
with him two Paris Municipals ; they were chosen from the Three Hundred
for that errand . He gets admittance through the locked and padlocked
Grates , through sentries and ushers , to the Royal Halls .

The Court , male and female , crowds on his passage , to read their doom
on his face ; which exhibits , say Historians , a mixture &apos; of sorrow , of
fervour and valour , &apos; singular to behold . ( Memoire de M. le Comte de
Lally @-@ Tollendal ( Janvier 1790 ) , p . 161 @-@ 165 . ) The King , with Monsieur ,
with Ministers and Marshals , is waiting to receive him : He &quot; is come , &quot; in
his highflown chivalrous way , &quot; to offer his head for the safety of his
Majesty &apos;s . &quot; The two Municipals state the wish of Paris : four things ,
of quite pacific tenor . First , that the honour of Guarding his sacred
person be conferred on patriot National Guards ; -- say , the Centre
Grenadiers , who as Gardes Francaises were wont to have that privilege .
Second , that provisions be got , if possible . Third , that the Prisons ,
all crowded with political delinquents , may have judges sent them .
Fourth , that it would please his Majesty to come and live in Paris . To
all which four wishes , except the fourth , his Majesty answers readily ,
Yes ; or indeed may almost say that he has already answered it . To the
fourth he can answer only , Yes or No ; would so gladly answer , Yes and
No ! -- But , in any case , are not their dispositions , thank Heaven , so
entirely pacific ? There is time for deliberation . The brunt of the
danger seems past !

Lafayette and d &apos;Estaing settle the watches ; Centre Grenadiers are to
take the Guard @-@ room they of old occupied as Gardes Francaises ; -- for
indeed the Gardes du Corps , its late ill @-@ advised occupants , are gone
mostly to Rambouillet . That is the order of this night ; sufficient
for the night is the evil thereof . Whereupon Lafayette and the two
Municipals , with highflown chivalry , take their leave .

So brief has the interview been , Mounier and his Deputation were not yet
got up . So brief and satisfactory . A stone is rolled from every heart .
The fair Palace Dames publicly declare that this Lafayette , detestable
though he be , is their saviour for once . Even the ancient vinaigrous
Tantes admit it ; the King &apos;s Aunts , ancient Graille and Sisterhood , known
to us of old . Queen Marie @-@ Antoinette has been heard often say the like .
She alone , among all women and all men , wore a face of courage , of lofty
calmness and resolve , this day . She alone saw clearly what she meant
to do ; and Theresa &apos;s Daughter dares do what she means , were all France
threatening her : abide where her children are , where her husband is .

Towards three in the morning all things are settled : the watches set ,
the Centre Grenadiers put into their old Guard @-@ room , and harangued ;
the Swiss , and few remaining Bodyguards harangued . The wayworn Paris
Batallions , consigned to &apos; the hospitality of Versailles , &apos; lie dormant
in spare @-@ beds , spare @-@ barracks , coffeehouses , empty churches . A troop
of them , on their way to the Church of Saint @-@ Louis , awoke poor
Weber , dreaming troublous , in the Rue Sartory . Weber has had his
waistcoat @-@ pocket full of balls all day ; &apos; two hundred balls , and two
pears of powder ! &apos; For waistcoats were waistcoats then , and had flaps
down to mid @-@ thigh . So many balls he has had all day ; but no opportunity
of using them : he turns over now , execrating disloyal bandits ; swears a
prayer or two , and straight to sleep again .

Finally , the National Assembly is harangued ; which thereupon , on motion
of Mirabeau , discontinues the Penal Code , and dismisses for this night .
Menadism , Sansculottism has cowered into guard @-@ houses , barracks of
Flandre , to the light of cheerful fire ; failing that , to churches ,
office @-@ houses , sentry @-@ boxes , wheresoever wretchedness can find a lair .
The troublous Day has brawled itself to rest : no lives yet lost but that
of one warhorse . Insurrectionary Chaos lies slumbering round the Palace ,
like Ocean round a Diving @-@ bell , -- no crevice yet disclosing itself .

Deep sleep has fallen promiscuously on the high and on the low ;
suspending most things , even wrath and famine . Darkness covers the
Earth . But , far on the North @-@ east , Paris flings up her great yellow
gleam ; far into the wet black Night . For all is illuminated there , as
in the old July Nights ; the streets deserted , for alarm of war ; the
Municipals all wakeful ; Patrols hailing , with their hoarse Who @-@ goes .
There , as we discover , our poor slim Louison Chabray , her poor nerves
all fluttered , is arriving about this very hour . There Usher Maillard
will arrive , about an hour hence , &apos; towards four in the morning . &apos; They
report , successively , to a wakeful Hotel @-@ de @-@ Ville what comfort they can
report ; which again , with early dawn , large comfortable Placards , shall
impart to all men .

Lafayette , in the Hotel de Noailles , not far from the Chateau , having
now finished haranguing , sits with his Officers consulting : at five
o &apos;clock the unanimous best counsel is , that a man so tost and toiled for
twenty @-@ four hours and more , fling himself on a bed , and seek some rest .

Thus , then , has ended the First Act of the Insurrection of Women . How it
will turn on the morrow ? The morrow , as always , is with the Fates ! But
his Majesty , one may hope , will consent to come honourably to Paris ;
at all events , he can visit Paris . Anti @-@ national Bodyguards , here and
elsewhere , must take the National Oath ; make reparation to the Tricolor ;
Flandre will swear . There may be much swearing ; much public speaking
there will infallibly be : and so , with harangues and vows , may the
matter in some handsome way , wind itself up .

Or , alas , may it not be all otherwise , unhandsome : the consent not
honourable , but extorted , ignominious ? Boundless Chaos of Insurrection
presses slumbering round the Palace , like Ocean round a Diving @-@ bell ; and
may penetrate at any crevice . Let but that accumulated insurrectionary
mass find entrance ! Like the infinite inburst of water ; or say

Chapter 1.7.X.

The Grand Entries .

The dull dawn of a new morning , drizzly and chill , had but broken over
Versailles , when it pleased Destiny that a Bodyguard should look out of
window , on the right wing of the Chateau , to see what prospect there was
in Heaven and in Earth . Rascality male and female is prowling in view
of him . His fasting stomach is , with good cause , sour ; he perhaps cannot
forbear a passing malison on them ; least of all can he forbear answering
such .

Ill words breed worse : till the worst word came ; and then the ill deed .
Did the maledicent Bodyguard , getting ( as was too inevitable ) better
malediction than he gave , load his musketoon , and threaten to fire ;
and actually fire ? Were wise who wist ! It stands asserted ; to us not
credibly . Be this as it may , menaced Rascality , in whinnying scorn , is
shaking at all Grates : the fastening of one ( some write , it was a chain
merely ) gives way ; Rascality is in the Grand Court , whinnying louder
still .

The maledicent Bodyguard , more Bodyguards than he do now give fire ; a
man &apos;s arm is shattered . Lecointre will depose ( Deposition de Lecointre
in Hist . Parl. iii . 111 @-@ 115 . ) that &apos; the Sieur Cardaine , a National
Guard without arms , was stabbed . &apos; But see , sure enough , poor Jerome
l &apos;Heritier , an unarmed National Guard he too , &apos; cabinet @-@ maker , a
saddler &apos;s son , of Paris , &apos; with the down of youthhood still on his
chin , -- he reels death @-@ stricken ; rushes to the pavement , scattering it
with his blood and brains ! -- Allelew ! Wilder than Irish wakes , rises the
howl : of pity ; of infinite revenge . In few moments , the Grate of the
inner and inmost Court , which they name Court of Marble , this too
is forced , or surprised , and burst open : the Court of Marble too is
overflowed : up the Grand Staircase , up all stairs and entrances rushes
the living Deluge ! Deshuttes and Varigny , the two sentry Bodyguards ,
are trodden down , are massacred with a hundred pikes . Women snatch their
cutlasses , or any weapon , and storm @-@ in Menadic : -- other women lift the
corpse of shot Jerome ; lay it down on the Marble steps ; there shall the
livid face and smashed head , dumb for ever , speak .

Wo now to all Bodyguards , mercy is none for them ! Miomandre de
Sainte @-@ Marie pleads with soft words , on the Grand Staircase , &apos; descending
four steps : &apos; -- to the roaring tornado . His comrades snatch him up , by the
skirts and belts ; literally , from the jaws of Destruction ; and slam @-@ to
their Door . This also will stand few instants ; the panels shivering in ,
like potsherds . Barricading serves not : fly fast , ye Bodyguards ; rabid
Insurrection , like the hellhound Chase , uproaring at your heels !

The terrorstruck Bodyguards fly , bolting and barricading ; it follows .
Whitherward ? Through hall on hall : wo , now ! towards the Queen &apos;s Suite
of Rooms , in the furtherest room of which the Queen is now asleep .
Five sentinels rush through that long Suite ; they are in the Anteroom
knocking loud : &quot; Save the Queen ! &quot; Trembling women fall at their feet with
tears ; are answered : &quot; Yes , we will die ; save ye the Queen ! &quot;

Tremble not , women , but haste : for , lo , another voice shouts far through
the outermost door , &quot; Save the Queen ! &quot; and the door shut . It is brave
Miomandre &apos;s voice that shouts this second warning . He has stormed across
imminent death to do it ; fronts imminent death , having done it . Brave
Tardivet du Repaire , bent on the same desperate service , was borne down
with pikes ; his comrades hardly snatched him in again alive . Miomandre
and Tardivet : let the names of these two Bodyguards , as the names of
brave men should , live long .

Trembling Maids of Honour , one of whom from afar caught glimpse of
Miomandre as well as heard him , hastily wrap the Queen ; not in robes
of State . She flies for her life , across the Oeil @-@ de @-@ Boeuf ; against
the main door of which too Insurrection batters . She is in the King &apos;s
Apartment , in the King &apos;s arms ; she clasps her children amid a faithful
few . The Imperial @-@ hearted bursts into mother &apos;s tears : &quot; O my friends ,
save me and my children , O mes amis , sauvez moi et mes enfans ! &quot;
The battering of Insurrectionary axes clangs audible across the
Oeil @-@ de @-@ Boeuf . What an hour !

Yes , Friends : a hideous fearful hour ; shameful alike to Governed and
Governor ; wherein Governed and Governor ignominiously testify that their
relation is at an end . Rage , which had brewed itself in twenty thousand
hearts , for the last four @-@ and @-@ twenty hours , has taken fire : Jerome &apos;s
brained corpse lies there as live @-@ coal . It is , as we said , the infinite
Element bursting in : wild @-@ surging through all corridors and conduits .

Meanwhile , the poor Bodyguards have got hunted mostly into the
Oeil @-@ de @-@ Boeuf . They may die there , at the King &apos;s threshhold ; they can
do little to defend it . They are heaping tabourets ( stools of honour ) ,
benches and all moveables , against the door ; at which the axe of
Insurrection thunders . -- But did brave Miomandre perish , then , at the
Queen &apos;s door ? No , he was fractured , slashed , lacerated , left for dead ;
he has nevertheless crawled hither ; and shall live , honoured of loyal
France . Remark also , in flat contradiction to much which has been said
and sung , that Insurrection did not burst that door he had defended ; but
hurried elsewhither , seeking new bodyguards . ( Campan , ii . 75 @-@ 87 . )

Poor Bodyguards , with their Thyestes &apos; Opera @-@ Repast ! Well for them , that
Insurrection has only pikes and axes ; no right sieging tools ! It shakes
and thunders . Must they all perish miserably , and Royalty with them ?
Deshuttes and Varigny , massacred at the first inbreak , have been
beheaded in the Marble Court : a sacrifice to Jerome &apos;s manes : Jourdan
with the tile @-@ beard did that duty willingly ; and asked , If there were
no more ? Another captive they are leading round the corpse , with
howl @-@ chauntings : may not Jourdan again tuck up his sleeves ?

And louder and louder rages Insurrection within , plundering if it cannot
kill ; louder and louder it thunders at the Oeil @-@ de @-@ Boeuf : what can
now hinder its bursting in ? -- On a sudden it ceases ; the battering has
ceased ! Wild rushing : the cries grow fainter : there is silence , or the
tramp of regular steps ; then a friendly knocking : &quot; We are the Centre
Grenadiers , old Gardes Francaises : Open to us , Messieurs of the
Garde @-@ du @-@ Corps ; we have not forgotten how you saved us at Fontenoy ! &quot;
( Toulongeon , i . 144 . ) The door is opened ; enter Captain Gondran and
the Centre Grenadiers : there are military embracings ; there is sudden
deliverance from death into life .

Strange Sons of Adam ! It was to &apos; exterminate &apos; these Gardes @-@ du @-@ Corps that
the Centre Grenadiers left home : and now they have rushed to save them
from extermination . The memory of common peril , of old help , melts
the rough heart ; bosom is clasped to bosom , not in war . The King shews
himself , one moment , through the door of his Apartment , with : &quot; Do not
hurt my Guards ! &quot; -- &quot; Soyons freres , Let us be brothers ! &quot; cries Captain
Gondran ; and again dashes off , with levelled bayonets , to sweep the
Palace clear .

Now too Lafayette , suddenly roused , not from sleep ( for his eyes had
not yet closed ) , arrives ; with passionate popular eloquence , with prompt
military word of command . National Guards , suddenly roused , by sound of
trumpet and alarm @-@ drum , are all arriving . The death @-@ melly ceases : the
first sky @-@ lambent blaze of Insurrection is got damped down ; it burns
now , if unextinguished , yet flameless , as charred coals do , and not
inextinguishable . The King &apos;s Apartments are safe . Ministers , Officials ,
and even some loyal National deputies are assembling round their
Majesties . The consternation will , with sobs and confusion , settle down
gradually , into plan and counsel , better or worse .

But glance now , for a moment , from the royal windows ! A roaring sea of
human heads , inundating both Courts ; billowing against all passages :
Menadic women ; infuriated men , mad with revenge , with love of mischief ,
love of plunder ! Rascality has slipped its muzzle ; and now bays ,
three @-@ throated , like the Dog of Erebus . Fourteen Bodyguards are wounded ;
two massacred , and as we saw , beheaded ; Jourdan asking , &quot; Was it worth
while to come so far for two ? &quot; Hapless Deshuttes and Varigny ! Their
fate surely was sad . Whirled down so suddenly to the abyss ; as men are ,
suddenly , by the wide thunder of the Mountain Avalanche , awakened not
by them , awakened far off by others ! When the Chateau Clock last struck ,
they two were pacing languid , with poised musketoon ; anxious mainly
that the next hour would strike . It has struck ; to them inaudible . Their
trunks lie mangled : their heads parade , &apos; on pikes twelve feet long , &apos;
through the streets of Versailles ; and shall , about noon reach the
Barriers of Paris , -- a too ghastly contradiction to the large comfortable
Placards that have been posted there !

The other captive Bodyguard is still circling the corpse of Jerome , amid
Indian war @-@ whooping ; bloody Tilebeard , with tucked sleeves , brandishing
his bloody axe ; when Gondran and the Grenadiers come in sight .
&quot; Comrades , will you see a man massacred in cold blood ? &quot; -- &quot; Off ,
butchers ! &quot; answer they ; and the poor Bodyguard is free . Busy runs
Gondran , busy run Guards and Captains ; scouring at all corridors ;
dispersing Rascality and Robbery ; sweeping the Palace clear . The mangled
carnage is removed ; Jerome &apos;s body to the Townhall , for inquest : the fire
of Insurrection gets damped , more and more , into measurable , manageable
heat .

Transcendent things of all sorts , as in the general outburst of
multitudinous Passion , are huddled together ; the ludicrous , nay the
ridiculous , with the horrible . Far over the billowy sea of heads , may be
seen Rascality , caprioling on horses from the Royal Stud . The Spoilers
these ; for Patriotism is always infected so , with a proportion of mere
thieves and scoundrels . Gondran snatched their prey from them in the
Chateau ; whereupon they hurried to the Stables , and took horse there .
But the generous Diomedes &apos; steeds , according to Weber , disdained such
scoundrel @-@ burden ; and , flinging up their royal heels , did soon project
most of it , in parabolic curves , to a distance , amid peals of laughter :
and were caught . Mounted National Guards secured the rest .

Now too is witnessed the touching last @-@ flicker of Etiquette ; which
sinks not here , in the Cimmerian World @-@ wreckage , without a sign , as
the house @-@ cricket might still chirp in the pealing of a Trump of Doom .
&quot; Monsieur , &quot; said some Master of Ceremonies ( one hopes it might be de
Breze ) , as Lafayette , in these fearful moments , was rushing towards
the inner Royal Apartments , &quot; Monsieur , le Roi vous accorde les grandes
entrees , Monsieur , the King grants you the Grand Entries , &quot; -- not finding
it convenient to refuse them ! ( Toulongeon , 1 App . 120 . )



Chapter 1.7.XI.

From Versailles .

However , the Paris National Guard , wholly under arms , has cleared
the Palace , and even occupies the nearer external spaces ; extruding
miscellaneous Patriotism , for most part , into the Grand Court , or even
into the Forecourt .

The Bodyguards , you can observe , have now of a verity , &apos; hoisted the
National Cockade : &apos; for they step forward to the windows or balconies ,
hat aloft in hand , on each hat a huge tricolor ; and fling over their
bandoleers in sign of surrender ; and shout Vive la Nation . To which
how can the generous heart respond but with , Vive le Roi ; vivent les
Gardes @-@ du @-@ Corps ? His Majesty himself has appeared with Lafayette on the
balcony , and again appears : Vive le Roi greets him from all throats ; but
also from some one throat is heard &quot; Le Roi a Paris , The King to Paris ! &quot;

Her Majesty too , on demand , shows herself , though there is peril in
it : she steps out on the balcony , with her little boy and girl . &quot; No
children , Point d &apos;enfans ! &quot; cry the voices . She gently pushes back her
children ; and stands alone , her hands serenely crossed on her breast :
&quot; should I die , &quot; she had said , &quot; I will do it . &quot; Such serenity of heroism
has its effect . Lafayette , with ready wit , in his highflown chivalrous
way , takes that fair queenly hand ; and reverently kneeling , kisses it :
thereupon the people do shout Vive la Reine . Nevertheless , poor Weber
&apos;saw &apos; ( or even thought he saw ; for hardly the third part of poor Weber &apos;s
experiences , in such hysterical days , will stand scrutiny ) &apos; one of these
brigands level his musket at her Majesty , &apos; -- with or without intention to
shoot ; for another of the brigands &apos; angrily struck it down . &apos; 

So that all , and the Queen herself , nay the very Captain of the
Bodyguards , have grown National ! The very Captain of the Bodyguards
steps out now with Lafayette . On the hat of the repentant man is an
enormous tricolor ; large as a soup @-@ platter , or sun @-@ flower ; visible to
the utmost Forecourt . He takes the National Oath with a loud voice ,
elevating his hat ; at which sight all the army raise their bonnets on
their bayonets , with shouts . Sweet is reconcilement to the heart of man .
Lafayette has sworn Flandre ; he swears the remaining Bodyguards , down in
the Marble Court ; the people clasp them in their arms : -- O , my brothers ,
why would ye force us to slay you ? Behold there is joy over you , as
over returning prodigal sons ! -- The poor Bodyguards , now National and
tricolor , exchange bonnets , exchange arms ; there shall be peace and
fraternity . And still &quot; Vive le Roi ; &quot; and also &quot; Le Roi a Paris , &quot; not now
from one throat , but from all throats as one , for it is the heart &apos;s wish
of all mortals .

Yes , The King to Paris : what else ? Ministers may consult , and National
Deputies wag their heads : but there is now no other possibility . You
have forced him to go willingly . &quot; At one o &apos;clock ! &quot; Lafayette gives
audible assurance to that purpose ; and universal Insurrection , with
immeasurable shout , and a discharge of all the firearms , clear and
rusty , great and small , that it has , returns him acceptance . What a
sound ; heard for leagues : a doom peal ! -- That sound too rolls away , into
the Silence of Ages . And the Chateau of Versailles stands ever since
vacant , hushed still ; its spacious Courts grassgrown , responsive to
the hoe of the weeder . Times and generations roll on , in their confused
Gulf @-@ current ; and buildings like builders have their destiny .

Till one o &apos;clock , then , there will be three parties , National Assembly ,
National Rascality , National Royalty , all busy enough . Rascality
rejoices ; women trim themselves with tricolor . Nay motherly Paris has
sent her Avengers sufficient &apos; cartloads of loaves ; &apos; which are shouted
over , which are gratefully consumed . The Avengers , in return , are
searching for grain @-@ stores ; loading them in fifty waggons ; that so a
National King , probable harbinger of all blessings , may be the evident
bringer of plenty , for one .

And thus has Sansculottism made prisoner its King ; revoking his
parole . The Monarchy has fallen ; and not so much as honourably : no ,
ignominiously ; with struggle , indeed , oft repeated ; but then with unwise
struggle ; wasting its strength in fits and paroxysms ; at every new
paroxysm , foiled more pitifully than before . Thus Broglie &apos;s whiff
of grapeshot , which might have been something , has dwindled to the
pot @-@ valour of an Opera Repast , and O Richard , O mon Roi . Which again we
shall see dwindle to a Favras &apos; Conspiracy , a thing to be settled by the
hanging of one Chevalier .

Poor Monarchy ! But what save foulest defeat can await that man , who
wills , and yet wills not ? Apparently the King either has a right ,
assertible as such to the death , before God and man ; or else he has no
right . Apparently , the one or the other ; could he but know which ! May
Heaven pity him ! Were Louis wise he would this day abdicate . -- Is it not
strange so few Kings abdicate ; and none yet heard of has been known to
commit suicide ? Fritz the First , of Prussia , alone tried it ; and they
cut the rope .

As for the National Assembly , which decrees this morning that it &apos; is
inseparable from his Majesty , &apos; and will follow him to Paris , there
may one thing be noted : its extreme want of bodily health . After the
Fourteenth of July there was a certain sickliness observable among
honourable Members ; so many demanding passports , on account of infirm
health . But now , for these following days , there is a perfect
murrian : President Mounier , Lally Tollendal , Clermont Tonnere , and all
Constitutional Two @-@ Chamber Royalists needing change of air ; as most
No @-@ Chamber Royalists had formerly done .

For , in truth , it is the second Emigration this that has now come ;
most extensive among Commons Deputies , Noblesse , Clergy : so that &apos; to
Switzerland alone there go sixty thousand . &apos; They will return in the day
of accounts ! Yes , and have hot welcome . -- But Emigration on Emigration is
the peculiarity of France . One Emigration follows another ; grounded on
reasonable fear , unreasonable hope , largely also on childish pet . The
highflyers have gone first , now the lower flyers ; and ever the lower
will go down to the crawlers . Whereby , however , cannot our National
Assembly so much the more commodiously make the Constitution ; your
Two @-@ Chamber Anglomaniacs being all safe , distant on foreign shores ? Abbe
Maury is seized , and sent back again : he , tough as tanned leather , with
eloquent Captain Cazales and some others , will stand it out for another
year .

But here , meanwhile , the question arises : Was Philippe d &apos;Orleans seen ,
this day , &apos; in the Bois de Boulogne , in grey surtout ; &apos; waiting under the
wet sere foliage , what the day might bring forth ? Alas , yes , the Eidolon
of him was , -- in Weber &apos;s and other such brains . The Chatelet shall make
large inquisition into the matter , examining a hundred and seventy
witnesses , and Deputy Chabroud publish his Report ; but disclose nothing
further . ( Rapport de Chabroud ( Moniteur , du 31 December , 1789 ) . ) What
then has caused these two unparalleled October Days ? For surely such
dramatic exhibition never yet enacted itself without Dramatist and
Machinist . Wooden Punch emerges not , with his domestic sorrows , into the
light of day , unless the wire be pulled : how can human mobs ? Was it not
d &apos;Orleans then , and Laclos , Marquis Sillery , Mirabeau and the sons of
confusion , hoping to drive the King to Metz , and gather the spoil ? Nay
was it not , quite contrariwise , the Oeil @-@ de @-@ Boeuf , Bodyguard Colonel de
Guiche , Minister Saint @-@ Priest and highflying Loyalists ; hoping also to
drive him to Metz ; and try it by the sword of civil war ? Good Marquis
Toulongeon , the Historian and Deputy , feels constrained to admit that it
was both . ( Toulongeon , i . 150 . )

Alas , my Friends , credulous incredulity is a strange matter . But when a
whole Nation is smitten with Suspicion , and sees a dramatic miracle
in the very operation of the gastric juices , what help is there ? Such
Nation is already a mere hypochondriac bundle of diseases ; as good as
changed into glass ; atrabiliar , decadent ; and will suffer crises . Is not
Suspicion itself the one thing to be suspected , as Montaigne feared only
fear ?

Now , however , the short hour has struck . His Majesty is in his carriage ,
with his Queen , sister Elizabeth , and two royal children . Not for
another hour can the infinite Procession get marshalled , and under way .
The weather is dim drizzling ; the mind confused ; and noise great .

Processional marches not a few our world has seen ; Roman triumphs and
ovations , Cabiric cymbal @-@ beatings , Royal progresses , Irish funerals :
but this of the French Monarchy marching to its bed remained to be
seen . Miles long , and of breadth losing itself in vagueness , for all
the neighbouring country crowds to see . Slow ; stagnating along , like
shoreless Lake , yet with a noise like Niagara , like Babel and Bedlam . A
splashing and a tramping ; a hurrahing , uproaring , musket @-@ volleying ; -- the
truest segment of Chaos seen in these latter Ages ! Till slowly it
disembogue itself , in the thickening dusk , into expectant Paris , through
a double row of faces all the way from Passy to the Hotel @-@ de @-@ Ville .

Consider this : Vanguard of National troops ; with trains of artillery ; of
pikemen and pikewomen , mounted on cannons , on carts , hackney @-@ coaches ,
or on foot ; -- tripudiating , in tricolor ribbons from head to heel ; loaves
stuck on the points of bayonets , green boughs stuck in gun barrels .
( Mercier , Nouveau Paris , iii . 21 . ) Next , as main @-@ march , &apos; fifty
cartloads of corn , &apos; which have been lent , for peace , from the stores of
Versailles . Behind which follow stragglers of the Garde @-@ du @-@ Corps ;
all humiliated , in Grenadier bonnets . Close on these comes the Royal
Carriage ; come Royal Carriages : for there are an Hundred National
Deputies too , among whom sits Mirabeau , -- his remarks not given . Then
finally , pellmell , as rearguard , Flandre , Swiss , Hundred Swiss , other
Bodyguards , Brigands , whosoever cannot get before . Between and among all
which masses , flows without limit Saint @-@ Antoine , and the Menadic Cohort .
Menadic especially about the Royal Carriage ; tripudiating there , covered
with tricolor ; singing &apos; allusive songs ; &apos; pointing with one hand to
the Royal Carriage , which the illusions hit , and pointing to the
Provision @-@ wagons , with the other hand , and these words : &quot; Courage ,
Friends ! We shall not want bread now ; we are bringing you the Baker ,
the Bakeress , and Baker &apos;s Boy ( le Boulanger , la Boulangere , et le petit
Mitron ) . &quot; ( Toulongeon , i . 134 @-@ 161 ; Deux Amis ( iii. c . 9 ) ; &amp; c . &amp; c . )

The wet day draggles the tricolor , but the joy is unextinguishable . Is
not all well now ? &quot; Ah , Madame , notre bonne Reine , &quot; said some of these
Strong @-@ women some days hence , &quot; Ah Madame , our good Queen , don &apos;t be a
traitor any more ( ne soyez plus traitre ) , and we will all love you ! &quot;
Poor Weber went splashing along , close by the Royal carriage , with the
tear in his eye : &apos; their Majesties did me the honour , &apos; or I thought they
did it , &apos; to testify , from time to time , by shrugging of the shoulders ,
by looks directed to Heaven , the emotions they felt . &apos; Thus , like frail
cockle , floats the Royal Life @-@ boat , helmless , on black deluges of
Rascality .

Mercier , in his loose way , estimates the Procession and assistants
at two hundred thousand . He says it was one boundless inarticulate
Haha ; -- transcendent World @-@ Laughter ; comparable to the Saturnalia of
the Ancients . Why not ? Here too , as we said , is Human Nature once more
human ; shudder at it whoso is of shuddering humour : yet behold it is
human . It has &apos; swallowed all formulas ; &apos; it tripudiates even so . For
which reason they that collect Vases and Antiques , with figures of
Dancing Bacchantes &apos; in wild and all but impossible positions , &apos; may look
with some interest on it .

Thus , however , has the slow @-@ moving Chaos or modern Saturnalia of the
Ancients , reached the Barrier ; and must halt , to be harangued by Mayor
Bailly . Thereafter it has to lumber along , between the double row
of faces , in the transcendent heaven @-@ lashing Haha ; two hours longer ,
towards the Hotel @-@ de @-@ Ville . Then again to be harangued there , by
several persons ; by Moreau de Saint @-@ Mery , among others ; Moreau of the
Three @-@ thousand orders , now National Deputy for St. Domingo . To all which
poor Louis , who seemed to &apos; experience a slight emotion &apos; on entering this
Townhall , can answer only that he &quot; comes with pleasure , with confidence
among his people . &quot; Mayor Bailly , in reporting it , forgets &apos; confidence ; &apos;
and the poor Queen says eagerly : &quot; Add , with confidence . &quot; -- &quot; Messieurs , &quot;
rejoins Bailly , &quot; You are happier than if I had not forgot . &quot;

Finally , the King is shewn on an upper balcony , by torchlight , with a
huge tricolor in his hat : &apos; And all the &quot; people , &quot; says Weber , grasped one
another &apos;s hands ; -- thinking now surely the New Era was born . &apos; Hardly till
eleven at night can Royalty get to its vacant , long @-@ deserted Palace of
the Tuileries : to lodge there , somewhat in strolling @-@ player fashion . It
is Tuesday , the sixth of October , 1789 .

Poor Louis has Two other Paris Processions to make : one
ludicrous @-@ ignominious like this ; the other not ludicrous nor
ignominious , but serious , nay sublime .

THE FEAST OF PIKES


Chapter 2.1.I.

In the Tuileries .

The victim having once got his stroke @-@ of @-@ grace , the catastrophe can be
considered as almost come . There is small interest now in watching his
long low moans : notable only are his sharper agonies , what convulsive
struggles he may take to cast the torture off from him ; and then finally
the last departure of life itself , and how he lies extinct and ended ,
either wrapt like Caesar in decorous mantle @-@ folds , or unseemly sunk
together , like one that had not the force even to die .

Was French Royalty , when wrenched forth from its tapestries in that
fashion , on that Sixth of October 1789 , such a victim ? Universal France ,
and Royal Proclamation to all the Provinces , answers anxiously , No ;
nevertheless one may fear the worst . Royalty was beforehand so decrepit ,
moribund , there is little life in it to heal an injury . How much of
its strength , which was of the imagination merely , has fled ; Rascality
having looked plainly in the King &apos;s face , and not died ! When the
assembled crows can pluck up their scarecrow , and say to it , Here shalt
thou stand and not there ; and can treat with it , and make it , from an
infinite , a quite finite Constitutional scarecrow , -- what is to be looked
for ? Not in the finite Constitutional scarecrow , but in what still
unmeasured , infinite @-@ seeming force may rally round it , is there
thenceforth any hope . For it is most true that all available Authority
is mystic in its conditions , and comes &apos; by the grace of God . &apos; 

Cheerfuller than watching the death @-@ struggles of Royalism will it be to
watch the growth and gambollings of Sansculottism ; for , in human things ,
especially in human society , all death is but a death @-@ birth : thus if the
sceptre is departing from Louis , it is only that , in other forms , other
sceptres , were it even pike @-@ sceptres , may bear sway . In a prurient
element , rich with nutritive influences , we shall find that
Sansculottism grows lustily , and even frisks in not ungraceful sport :
as indeed most young creatures are sportful ; nay , may it not be noted
further , that as the grown cat , and cat @-@ species generally , is the
cruellest thing known , so the merriest is precisely the kitten , or
growing cat ?

But fancy the Royal Family risen from its truckle @-@ beds on the morrow
of that mad day : fancy the Municipal inquiry , &quot; How would your Majesty
please to lodge ? &quot; -- and then that the King &apos;s rough answer , &quot; Each may
lodge as he can , I am well enough , &quot; is congeed and bowed away , in
expressive grins , by the Townhall Functionaries , with obsequious
upholsterers at their back ; and how the Chateau of the Tuileries is
repainted , regarnished into a golden Royal Residence ; and Lafayette with
his blue National Guards lies encompassing it , as blue Neptune ( in the
language of poets ) does an island , wooingly . Thither may the wrecks
of rehabilitated Loyalty gather ; if it will become Constitutional ; for
Constitutionalism thinks no evil ; Sansculottism itself rejoices in the
King &apos;s countenance . The rubbish of a Menadic Insurrection , as in this
ever @-@ kindly world all rubbish can and must be , is swept aside ; and so
again , on clear arena , under new conditions , with something even of a
new stateliness , we begin a new course of action .

Arthur Young has witnessed the strangest scene : Majesty walking
unattended in the Tuileries Gardens ; and miscellaneous tricolor crowds ,
who cheer it , and reverently make way for it : the very Queen commands at
lowest respectful silence , regretful avoidance . ( Arthur Young &apos;s Travels ,
i . 264 @-@ 280 . ) Simple ducks , in those royal waters , quackle for crumbs
from young royal fingers : the little Dauphin has a little railed garden ,
where he is seen delving , with ruddy cheeks and flaxen curled hair ; also
a little hutch to put his tools in , and screen himself against showers .
What peaceable simplicity ! Is it peace of a Father restored to his
children ? Or of a Taskmaster who has lost his whip ? Lafayette and the
Municipality and universal Constitutionalism assert the former , and do
what is in them to realise it . Such Patriotism as snarls dangerously ,
and shows teeth , Patrollotism shall suppress ; or far better , Royalty
shall soothe down the angry hair of it , by gentle pattings ; and , most
effectual of all , by fuller diet . Yes , not only shall Paris be fed , but
the King &apos;s hand be seen in that work . The household goods of the Poor
shall , up to a certain amount , by royal bounty , be disengaged from pawn ,
and that insatiable Mont de Piete disgorge : rides in the city with their
vive @-@ le @-@ roi need not fail ; and so by substance and show , shall Royalty ,
if man &apos;s art can popularise it , be popularised . ( Deux Amis , iii. c . 10 . )

Or , alas , is it neither restored Father nor diswhipped Taskmaster that
walks there ; but an anomalous complex of both these , and of innumerable
other heterogeneities ; reducible to no rubric , if not to this newly
devised one : King Louis Restorer of French Liberty ? Man indeed , and
King Louis like other men , lives in this world to make rule out of the
ruleless ; by his living energy , he shall force the absurd itself to
become less absurd . But then if there be no living energy ; living
passivity only ? King Serpent , hurled into his unexpected watery
dominion , did at least bite , and assert credibly that he was there : but
as for the poor King Log , tumbled hither and thither as thousandfold
chance and other will than his might direct , how happy for him that
he was indeed wooden ; and , doing nothing , could also see and suffer
nothing ! It is a distracted business .

For his French Majesty , meanwhile , one of the worst things is that
he can get no hunting . Alas , no hunting henceforth ; only a fatal
being @-@ hunted ! Scarcely , in the next June weeks , shall he taste again the
joys of the game @-@ destroyer ; in next June , and never more . He sends for
his smith @-@ tools ; gives , in the course of the day , official or ceremonial
business being ended , &apos; a few strokes of the file , quelques coups de
lime . ( Le Chateau des Tuileries , ou recit , &amp; c . , par Roussel ( in Hist .
Parl. iv . 195 @-@ 219 ) . ) Innocent brother mortal , why wert thou not an
obscure substantial maker of locks ; but doomed in that other far @-@ seen
craft , to be a maker only of world @-@ follies , unrealities ; things self
destructive , which no mortal hammering could rivet into coherence !

Poor Louis is not without insight , nor even without the elements of
will ; some sharpness of temper , spurting at times from a stagnating
character . If harmless inertness could save him , it were well ; but he
will slumber and painfully dream , and to do aught is not given him .
Royalist Antiquarians still shew the rooms where Majesty and suite ,
in these extraordinary circumstances , had their lodging . Here sat the
Queen ; reading , -- for she had her library brought hither , though the
King refused his ; taking vehement counsel of the vehement uncounselled ;
sorrowing over altered times ; yet with sure hope of better : in her young
rosy Boy , has she not the living emblem of hope ! It is a murky , working
sky ; yet with golden gleams -- of dawn , or of deeper meteoric night ? Here
again this chamber , on the other side of the main entrance , was the
King &apos;s : here his Majesty breakfasted , and did official work ; here
daily after breakfast he received the Queen ; sometimes in pathetic
friendliness ; sometimes in human sulkiness , for flesh is weak ; and , when
questioned about business would answer : &quot; Madame , your business is with
the children . &quot; Nay , Sire , were it not better you , your Majesty &apos;s self ,
took the children ? So asks impartial History ; scornful that the thicker
vessel was not also the stronger ; pity @-@ struck for the porcelain @-@ clay of
humanity rather than for the tile @-@ clay , -- though indeed both were broken !

So , however , in this Medicean Tuileries , shall the French King and Queen
now sit , for one @-@ and @-@ forty months ; and see a wild @-@ fermenting France
work out its own destiny , and theirs . Months bleak , ungenial , of rapid
vicissitude ; yet with a mild pale splendour , here and there : as of an
April that were leading to leafiest Summer ; as of an October that led
only to everlasting Frost . Medicean Tuileries , how changed since it was
a peaceful Tile field ! Or is the ground itself fate @-@ stricken , accursed :
an Atreus &apos; Palace ; for that Louvre window is still nigh , out of which a
Capet , whipt of the Furies , fired his signal of the Saint Bartholomew !
Dark is the way of the Eternal as mirrored in this world of Time : God &apos;s
way is in the sea , and His path in the great deep .



Chapter 2.1.II.

In the Salle de Manege .

To believing Patriots , however , it is now clear , that the Constitution
will march , marcher , -- had it once legs to stand on . Quick , then , ye
Patriots , bestir yourselves , and make it ; shape legs for it ! In the
Archeveche , or Archbishop &apos;s Palace , his Grace himself having fled ; and
afterwards in the Riding @-@ hall , named Manege , close on the Tuileries :
there does a National Assembly apply itself to the miraculous work .
Successfully , had there been any heaven @-@ scaling Prometheus among them ;
not successfully since there was none ! There , in noisy debate , for the
sessions are occasionally &apos; scandalous , &apos; and as many as three speakers
have been seen in the Tribune at once , -- let us continue to fancy it
wearing the slow months .

Tough , dogmatic , long of wind is Abbe Maury ; Ciceronian pathetic is
Cazales . Keen @-@ trenchant , on the other side , glitters a young Barnave ;
abhorrent of sophistry ; sheering , like keen Damascus sabre , all
sophistry asunder , -- reckless what else he sheer with it . Simple seemest
thou , O solid Dutch @-@ built Petion ; if solid , surely dull . Nor lifegiving
in that tone of thine , livelier polemical Rabaut . With ineffable
serenity sniffs great Sieyes , aloft , alone ; his Constitution ye may
babble over , ye may mar , but can by no possibility mend : is not Polity a
science he has exhausted ? Cool , slow , two military Lameths are visible ,
with their quality sneer , or demi @-@ sneer ; they shall gallantly refund
their Mother &apos;s Pension , when the Red Book is produced ; gallantly be
wounded in duels . A Marquis Toulongeon , whose Pen we yet thank , sits
there ; in stoical meditative humour , oftenest silent , accepts what
destiny will send . Thouret and Parlementary Duport produce mountains of
Reformed Law ; liberal , Anglomaniac , available and unavailable .
Mortals rise and fall . Shall goose Gobel , for example , -- or Go ( with an
umlaut ) bel , for he is of Strasburg German breed , be a Constitutional
Archbishop ?

Alone of all men there , Mirabeau may begin to discern clearly whither
all this is tending . Patriotism , accordingly , regrets that his zeal
seems to be getting cool . In that famed Pentecost @-@ Night of the Fourth
of August , when new Faith rose suddenly into miraculous fire , and old
Feudality was burnt up , men remarked that Mirabeau took no hand in it ;
that , in fact , he luckily happened to be absent . But did he not defend
the Veto , nay Veto Absolu ; and tell vehement Barnave that six hundred
irresponsible senators would make of all tyrannies the insupportablest ?
Again , how anxious was he that the King &apos;s Ministers should have seat and
voice in the National Assembly ; -- doubtless with an eye to being
Minister himself ! Whereupon the National Assembly decides , what is very
momentous , that no Deputy shall be Minister ; he , in his haughty stormful
manner , advising us to make it , &apos; no Deputy called Mirabeau . &apos; ( Moniteur ,
Nos. 65 , 86 ( 29th September , 7th November , 1789 ) . ) A man of perhaps
inveterate Feudalisms ; of stratagems ; too often visible leanings towards
the Royalist side : a man suspect ; whom Patriotism will unmask ! Thus , in
these June days , when the question Who shall have right to declare war ?
comes on , you hear hoarse Hawkers sound dolefully through the streets ,
&quot; Grand Treason of Count Mirabeau , price only one sou ; &quot; -- because he
pleads that it shall be not the Assembly but the King ! Pleads ; nay
prevails : for in spite of the hoarse Hawkers , and an endless Populace
raised by them to the pitch even of &apos; Lanterne , &apos; he mounts the Tribune
next day ; grim @-@ resolute ; murmuring aside to his friends that speak of
danger : &quot; I know it : I must come hence either in triumph , or else torn in
fragments ; &quot; and it was in triumph that he came .

A man of stout heart ; whose popularity is not of the populace , &apos; pas
populaciere ; &apos; whom no clamour of unwashed mobs without doors , or of
washed mobs within , can scarce from his way ! Dumont remembers hearing
him deliver a Report on Marseilles ; &apos; every word was interrupted on the
part of the Cote Droit by abusive epithets ; calumniator , liar , assassin ,
scoundrel ( scelerat ) : Mirabeau pauses a moment , and , in a honeyed
tone , addressing the most furious , says : &quot; I wait , Messieurs , till these
amenities be exhausted . &quot; &apos; ( Dumont , Souvenirs , p . 278 . ) A man enigmatic ,
difficult to unmask ! For example , whence comes his money ? Can the profit
of a Newspaper , sorely eaten into by Dame Le Jay ; can this , and the
eighteen francs a @-@ day your National Deputy has , be supposed equal
to this expenditure ? House in the Chaussee d &apos;Antin ; Country @-@ house at
Argenteuil ; splendours , sumptuosities , orgies ; -- living as if he had a
mint ! All saloons barred against Adventurer Mirabeau , are flung wide
open to King Mirabeau , the cynosure of Europe , whom female France
flutters to behold , -- though the Man Mirabeau is one and the same . As for
money , one may conjecture that Royalism furnishes it ; which if Royalism
do , will not the same be welcome , as money always is to him ?

&apos;Sold , &apos; whatever Patriotism thinks , he cannot readily be : the spiritual
fire which is in that man ; which shining through such confusions is
nevertheless Conviction , and makes him strong , and without which he
had no strength , -- is not buyable nor saleable ; in such transference of
barter , it would vanish and not be . Perhaps &apos; paid and not sold , paye pas
vendu : &apos; as poor Rivarol , in the unhappier converse way , calls himself
&apos;sold and not paid ! &apos; A man travelling , comet @-@ like , in splendour and
nebulosity , his wild way ; whom telescopic Patriotism may long watch ,
but , without higher mathematics , will not make out . A questionable
most blameable man ; yet to us the far notablest of all . With rich
munificence , as we often say , in a most blinkard , bespectacled ,
logic @-@ chopping generation , Nature has gifted this man with an eye .
Welcome is his word , there where he speaks and works ; and growing
ever welcomer ; for it alone goes to the heart of the business : logical
cobwebbery shrinks itself together ; and thou seest a thing , how it is ,
how is may be worked with .

Unhappily our National Assembly has much to do : a France to regenerate ;
and France is short of so many requisites ; short even of cash ! These
same Finances give trouble enough ; no choking of the Deficit ; which
gapes ever , Give , give ! To appease the Deficit we venture on a hazardous
step , sale of the Clergy &apos;s Lands and superfluous Edifices ; most
hazardous . Nay , given the sale , who is to buy them , ready @-@ money
having fled ? Wherefore , on the 19th day of December , a paper @-@ money of
&apos;Assignats , &apos; of Bonds secured , or assigned , on that Clerico @-@ National
Property , and unquestionable at least in payment of that , -- is decreed :
the first of a long series of like financial performances , which shall
astonish mankind . So that now , while old rags last , there shall be no
lack of circulating medium ; whether of commodities to circulate thereon
is another question . But , after all , does not this Assignat business
speak volumes for modern science ? Bankruptcy , we may say , was come , as
the end of all Delusions needs must come : yet how gently , in softening
diffusion , in mild succession , was it hereby made to fall ; -- like no
all @-@ destroying avalanche ; like gentle showers of a powdery impalpable
snow , shower after shower , till all was indeed buried , and yet little
was destroyed that could not be replaced , be dispensed with ! To such
length has modern machinery reached . Bankruptcy , we said , was great ; but
indeed Money itself is a standing miracle .

On the whole , it is a matter of endless difficulty , that of the Clergy .
Clerical property may be made the Nation &apos;s , and the Clergy hired
servants of the State ; but if so , is it not an altered Church ?
Adjustment enough , of the most confused sort , has become unavoidable .
Old landmarks , in any sense , avail not in a new France . Nay literally ,
the very Ground is new divided ; your old party @-@ coloured Provinces become
new uniform Departments , Eighty @-@ three in number ; -- whereby , as in some
sudden shifting of the Earth &apos;s axis , no mortal knows his new latitude at
once . The Twelve old Parlements too , what is to be done with them ? The
old Parlements are declared to be all &apos; in permanent vacation , &apos; -- till
once the new equal @-@ justice , of Departmental Courts , National
Appeal @-@ Court , of elective Justices , Justices of Peace , and other
Thouret @-@ and @-@ Duport apparatus be got ready . They have to sit there , these
old Parlements , uneasily waiting ; as it were , with the rope round their
neck ; crying as they can , Is there none to deliver us ? But happily the
answer being , None , none , they are a manageable class , these Parlements .
They can be bullied , even into silence ; the Paris Parliament , wiser
than most , has never whimpered . They will and must sit there ; in such
vacation as is fit ; their Chamber of Vacation distributes in the interim
what little justice is going . With the rope round their neck , their
destiny may be succinct ! On the 13th of November 1790 , Mayor Bailly
shall walk to the Palais de Justice , few even heeding him ; and with
municipal seal @-@ stamp and a little hot wax , seal up the Parlementary
Paper @-@ rooms , -- and the dread Parlement of Paris pass away , into Chaos ,
gently as does a Dream ! So shall the Parlements perish , succinctly ; and
innumerable eyes be dry .

Not so the Clergy . For granting even that Religion were dead ; that it
had died , half @-@ centuries ago , with unutterable Dubois ; or emigrated
lately , to Alsace , with Necklace @-@ Cardinal Rohan ; or that it now walked
as goblin revenant with Bishop Talleyrand of Autun ; yet does not the
Shadow of Religion , the Cant of Religion , still linger ? The Clergy have
means and material : means , of number , organization , social weight ; a
material , at lowest , of public ignorance , known to be the mother of
devotion . Nay , withal , is it incredible that there might , in simple
hearts , latent here and there like gold grains in the mud @-@ beach , still
dwell some real Faith in God , of so singular and tenacious a sort that
even a Maury or a Talleyrand , could still be the symbol for it ? -- Enough ,
and Clergy has strength , the Clergy has craft and indignation . It is a
most fatal business this of the Clergy . A weltering hydra @-@ coil , which
the National Assembly has stirred up about its ears ; hissing , stinging ;
which cannot be appeased , alive ; which cannot be trampled dead ! Fatal ,
from first to last ! Scarcely after fifteen months &apos; debating , can a Civil
Constitution of the Clergy be so much as got to paper ; and then for
getting it into reality ? Alas , such Civil Constitution is but an
agreement to disagree . It divides France from end to end , with a new
split , infinitely complicating all the other splits ; -- Catholicism , what
of it there is left , with the Cant of Catholicism , raging on the one
side , and sceptic Heathenism on the other ; both , by contradiction ,
waxing fanatic . What endless jarring , of Refractory hated Priests , and
Constitutional despised ones ; of tender consciences , like the King &apos;s ,
and consciences hot @-@ seared , like certain of his People &apos;s : the whole
to end in Feasts of Reason and a War of La Vendee ! So deep @-@ seated is
Religion in the heart of man , and holds of all infinite passions . If the
dead echo of it still did so much , what could not the living voice of it
once do ?

Finance and Constitution , Law and Gospel : this surely were work enough ;
yet this is not all . In fact , the Ministry , and Necker himself whom
a brass inscription &apos; fastened by the people over his door @-@ lintel&apos;
testifies to be the &apos; Ministre adore , &apos; are dwindling into clearer and
clearer nullity . Execution or legislation , arrangement or detail , from
their nerveless fingers all drops undone ; all lights at last on the
toiled shoulders of an august Representative Body . Heavy @-@ laden
National Assembly ! It has to hear of innumerable fresh revolts , Brigand
expeditions ; of Chateaus in the West , especially of Charter @-@ chests ,
Chartiers , set on fire ; for there too the overloaded Ass frightfully
recalcitrates . Of Cities in the South full of heats and jealousies ;
which will end in crossed sabres , Marseilles against Toulon , and
Carpentras beleaguered by Avignon ; -- such Royalist collision in a career
of Freedom ; nay Patriot collision , which a mere difference of velocity
will bring about ! Of a Jourdan Coup @-@ tete , who has skulked
thitherward , from the claws of the Chatelet ; and will raise whole
scoundrel @-@ regiments .

Also it has to hear of Royalist Camp of Jales : Jales mountain @-@ girdled
Plain , amid the rocks of the Cevennes ; whence Royalism , as is feared
and hoped , may dash down like a mountain deluge , and submerge France !
A singular thing this camp of Jales ; existing mostly on paper . For the
Soldiers at Jales , being peasants or National Guards , were in heart
sworn Sansculottes ; and all that the Royalist Captains could do was ,
with false words , to keep them , or rather keep the report of them , drawn
up there , visible to all imaginations , for a terror and a sign , -- if
peradventure France might be reconquered by theatrical machinery , by the
picture of a Royalist Army done to the life ! ( Dampmartin , Evenemens , i .
208 . ) Not till the third summer was this portent , burning out by fits
and then fading , got finally extinguished ; was the old Castle of Jales ,
no Camp being visible to the bodily eye , got blown asunder by some
National Guards .

Also it has to hear not only of Brissot and his Friends of the Blacks ,
but by and by of a whole St. Domingo blazing skyward ; blazing in literal
fire , and in far worse metaphorical ; beaconing the nightly main . Also
of the shipping interest , and the landed @-@ interest , and all manner
of interests , reduced to distress . Of Industry every where manacled ,
bewildered ; and only Rebellion thriving . Of sub @-@ officers , soldiers and
sailors in mutiny by land and water . Of soldiers , at Nanci , as we shall
see , needing to be cannonaded by a brave Bouille . Of sailors , nay the
very galley @-@ slaves , at Brest , needing also to be cannonaded ; but with no
Bouille to do it . For indeed , to say it in a word , in those days there
was no King in Israel , and every man did that which was right in his own
eyes . ( See Deux Amis , iii. c . 14 ; iv. c . 2 , 3 , 4 , 7 , 9 , 14 . Expedition
des Volontaires de Brest sur Lannion ; Les Lyonnais Sauveurs des
Dauphinois ; Massacre au Mans ; Troubles du Maine ( Pamphlets and Excerpts ,
in Hist . Parl. iii . 251 ; iv . 162 @-@ 168 ) , &amp; c . )

Such things has an august National Assembly to hear of , as it goes
on regenerating France . Sad and stern : but what remedy ? Get the
Constitution ready ; and all men will swear to it : for do not &apos; Addresses
of adhesion &apos; arrive by the cartload ? In this manner , by Heaven &apos;s
blessing , and a Constitution got ready , shall the bottomless fire @-@ gulf
be vaulted in , with rag @-@ paper ; and Order will wed Freedom , and live with
her there , -- till it grow too hot for them . O Cote Gauche , worthy are
ye , as the adhesive Addresses generally say , to &apos; fix the regards of the
Universe ; &apos; the regards of this one poor Planet , at lowest ! --

Nay , it must be owned , the Cote Droit makes a still madder figure .
An irrational generation ; irrational , imbecile , and with the vehement
obstinacy characteristic of that ; a generation which will not learn .
Falling Bastilles , Insurrections of Women , thousands of smoking
Manorhouses , a country bristling with no crop but that of Sansculottic
steel : these were tolerably didactic lessons ; but them they have not
taught . There are still men , of whom it was of old written , Bray them in
a mortar ! Or , in milder language , They have wedded their delusions : fire
nor steel , nor any sharpness of Experience , shall sever the bond ; till
death do us part ! Of such may the Heavens have mercy ; for the Earth ,
with her rigorous Necessity , will have none .

Admit , at the same time , that it was most natural . Man lives by
Hope : Pandora when her box of gods &apos; -gifts flew all out , and became
gods &apos; -curses , still retained Hope . How shall an irrational mortal ,
when his high @-@ place is never so evidently pulled down , and he , being
irrational , is left resourceless , -- part with the belief that it will be
rebuilt ? It would make all so straight again ; it seems so unspeakably
desirable ; so reasonable , -- would you but look at it aright ! For ,
must not the thing which was continue to be ; or else the solid World
dissolve ? Yes , persist , O infatuated Sansculottes of France ! Revolt
against constituted Authorities ; hunt out your rightful Seigneurs ,
who at bottom so loved you , and readily shed their blood for you , -- in
country &apos;s battles as at Rossbach and elsewhere ; and , even in preserving
game , were preserving you , could ye but have understood it : hunt
them out , as if they were wild wolves ; set fire to their Chateaus and
Chartiers as to wolf @-@ dens ; and what then ? Why , then turn every man his
hand against his fellow ! In confusion , famine , desolation , regret
the days that are gone ; rueful recall them , recall us with them . To
repentant prayers we will not be deaf .

So , with dimmer or clearer consciousness , must the Right Side reason
and act . An inevitable position perhaps ; but a most false one for them .
Evil , be thou our good : this henceforth must virtually be their prayer .
The fiercer the effervescence grows , the sooner will it pass ; for after
all it is but some mad effervescence ; the World is solid , and cannot
dissolve .

For the rest , if they have any positive industry , it is that of plots ,
and backstairs conclaves . Plots which cannot be executed ; which are
mostly theoretic on their part ; -- for which nevertheless this and the
other practical Sieur Augeard , Sieur Maillebois , Sieur Bonne Savardin ,
gets into trouble , gets imprisoned , and escapes with difficulty . Nay
there is a poor practical Chevalier Favras who , not without some passing
reflex on Monsieur himself , gets hanged for them , amid loud uproar
of the world . Poor Favras , he keeps dictating his last will at the
&apos;Hotel @-@ de @-@ Ville , through the whole remainder of the day , &apos; a weary
February day ; offers to reveal secrets , if they will save him ;
handsomely declines since they will not ; then dies , in the flare of
torchlight , with politest composure ; remarking , rather than exclaiming ,
with outspread hands : &quot; People , I die innocent ; pray for me . &quot; ( See Deux
Amis , iv. c . 14 , 7 ; Hist . Parl. vi . 384 . ) Poor Favras ; -- type of so much
that has prowled indefatigable over France , in days now ending ; and , in
freer field , might have earned instead of prowling , -- to thee it is no
theory !

In the Senate @-@ house again , the attitude of the Right Side is that of
calm unbelief . Let an august National Assembly make a Fourth @-@ of @-@ August
Abolition of Feudality ; declare the Clergy State @-@ servants who shall
have wages ; vote Suspensive Vetos , new Law @-@ Courts ; vote or decree what
contested thing it will ; have it responded to from the four corners
of France , nay get King &apos;s Sanction , and what other Acceptance were
conceivable , -- the Right Side , as we find , persists , with imperturbablest
tenacity , in considering , and ever and anon shews that it still
considers , all these so @-@ called Decrees as mere temporary whims , which
indeed stand on paper , but in practice and fact are not , and cannot be .
Figure the brass head of an Abbe Maury flooding forth Jesuitic eloquence
in this strain ; dusky d &apos;Espremenil , Barrel Mirabeau ( probably in
liquor ) , and enough of others , cheering him from the Right ; and , for
example , with what visage a seagreen Robespierre eyes him from the Left .
And how Sieyes ineffably sniffs on him , or does not deign to sniff ;
and how the Galleries groan in spirit , or bark rabid on him : so that to
escape the Lanterne , on stepping forth , he needs presence of mind , and a
pair of pistols in his girdle ! For he is one of the toughest of men .

Here indeed becomes notable one great difference between our two kinds
of civil war ; between the modern lingual or Parliamentary @-@ logical kind ,
and the ancient , or manual kind , in the steel battle @-@ field ; -- much to the
disadvantage of the former . In the manual kind , where you front your foe
with drawn weapon , one right stroke is final ; for , physically speaking ,
when the brains are out the man does honestly die , and trouble you no
more . But how different when it is with arguments you fight ! Here no
victory yet definable can be considered as final . Beat him down , with
Parliamentary invective , till sense be fled ; cut him in two , hanging
one half in this dilemma @-@ horn , the other on that ; blow the brains
or thinking @-@ faculty quite out of him for the time : it skills not ; he
rallies and revives on the morrow ; to @-@ morrow he repairs his golden
fires ! The think that will logically extinguish him is perhaps still a
desideratum in Constitutional civilisation . For how , till a man know ,
in some measure , at what point he becomes logically defunct , can
Parliamentary Business be carried on , and Talk cease or slake ?

Doubtless it was some feeling of this difficulty ; and the clear insight
how little such knowledge yet existed in the French Nation , new in the
Constitutional career , and how defunct Aristocrats would continue to
walk for unlimited periods , as Partridge the Alamanack @-@ maker did , -- that
had sunk into the deep mind of People &apos;s @-@ friend Marat , an eminently
practical mind ; and had grown there , in that richest putrescent soil ,
into the most original plan of action ever submitted to a People . Not
yet has it grown ; but it has germinated , it is growing ; rooting itself
into Tartarus , branching towards Heaven : the second season hence , we
shall see it risen out of the bottomless Darkness , full @-@ grown , into
disastrous Twilight , -- a Hemlock @-@ tree , great as the world ; on or under
whose boughs all the People &apos;s @-@ friends of the world may lodge . &apos; Two
hundred and sixty thousand Aristocrat heads : &apos; that is the precisest
calculation , though one would not stand on a few hundreds ; yet we never
rise as high as the round three hundred thousand . Shudder at it ,
O People ; but it is as true as that ye yourselves , and your
People &apos;s @-@ friend , are alive . These prating Senators of yours hover
ineffectual on the barren letter , and will never save the Revolution . A
Cassandra @-@ Marat cannot do it , with his single shrunk arm ; but with a few
determined men it were possible . &quot; Give me , &quot; said the People &apos;s @-@ friend , in
his cold way , when young Barbaroux , once his pupil in a course of what
was called Optics , went to see him , &quot; Give me two hundred Naples Bravoes ,
armed each with a good dirk , and a muff on his left arm by way
of shield : with them I will traverse France , and accomplish the
Revolution . &quot; ( Memoires de Barbaroux ( Paris , 1822 ) , p . 57 . ) Nay , be
brave , young Barbaroux ; for thou seest , there is no jesting in those
rheumy eyes ; in that soot @-@ bleared figure , most earnest of created
things ; neither indeed is there madness , of the strait @-@ waistcoat sort .

Such produce shall the Time ripen in cavernous Marat , the man forbid ;
living in Paris cellars , lone as fanatic Anchorite in his Thebaid ;
say , as far @-@ seen Simon on his Pillar , -- taking peculiar views therefrom .
Patriots may smile ; and , using him as bandog now to be muzzled , now to
be let bark , name him , as Desmoulins does , &apos; Maximum of Patriotism &apos; and
&apos;Cassandra @-@ Marat : &apos; but were it not singular if this dirk @-@ and @-@ muff plan
of his ( with superficial modifications ) proved to be precisely the plan
adopted ?

After this manner , in these circumstances , do august Senators regenerate
France . Nay , they are , in very deed , believed to be regenerating it ; on
account of which great fact , main fact of their history , the wearied eye
can never be permitted wholly to ignore them .

But looking away now from these precincts of the Tuileries , where
Constitutional Royalty , let Lafayette water it as he will , languishes
too like a cut branch ; and august Senators are perhaps at bottom only
perfecting their &apos; theory of defective verbs , &apos; -- how does the young
Reality , young Sansculottism thrive ? The attentive observer can answer :
It thrives bravely ; putting forth new buds ; expanding the old buds into
leaves , into boughs . Is not French Existence , as before , most prurient ,
all loosened , most nutrient for it ? Sansculottism has the property
of growing by what other things die of : by agitation , contention ,
disarrangement ; nay in a word , by what is the symbol and fruit of all
these : Hunger .

In such a France as this , Hunger , as we have remarked , can hardly fail .
The Provinces , the Southern Cities feel it in their turn ; and what it
brings : Exasperation , preternatural Suspicion . In Paris some halcyon
days of abundance followed the Menadic Insurrection , with its Versailles
grain @-@ carts , and recovered Restorer of Liberty ; but they could not
continue . The month is still October when famishing Saint @-@ Antoine , in a
moment of passion , seizes a poor Baker , innocent &apos; Francois the
Baker ; &apos; ( 21st October , 1789 ( Moniteur , No. 76 ) . ) and hangs him , in
Constantinople wise ; -- but even this , singular as it my seem , does not
cheapen bread ! Too clear it is , no Royal bounty , no Municipal dexterity
can adequately feed a Bastille @-@ destroying Paris . Wherefore , on view of
the hanged Baker , Constitutionalism in sorrow and anger demands &apos; Loi
Martiale , &apos; a kind of Riot Act ; -- and indeed gets it , most readily , almost
before the sun goes down .

This is that famed Martial law , with its Red Flag , its &apos; Drapeau Rouge : &apos;
in virtue of which Mayor Bailly , or any Mayor , has but henceforth to
hang out that new Oriflamme of his ; then to read or mumble something
about the King &apos;s peace ; and , after certain pauses , serve any
undispersing Assemblage with musket @-@ shot , or whatever shot will disperse
it . A decisive Law ; and most just on one proviso : that all Patrollotism
be of God , and all mob @-@ assembling be of the Devil ; -- otherwise not
so just . Mayor Bailly be unwilling to use it ! Hang not out that new
Oriflamme , flame not of gold but of the want of gold ! The thrice @-@ blessed
Revolution is done , thou thinkest ? If so it will be well with thee .

But now let no mortal say henceforth that an august National
Assembly wants riot : all it ever wanted was riot enough to balance
Court @-@ plotting ; all it now wants , of Heaven or of Earth , is to get its
theory of defective verbs perfected .



Chapter 2.1.III.

The Muster .

With famine and a Constitutional theory of defective verbs going on ,
all other excitement is conceivable . A universal shaking and sifting of
French Existence this is : in the course of which , for one thing , what a
multitude of low @-@ lying figures are sifted to the top , and set busily to
work there !

Dogleech Marat , now for @-@ seen as Simon Stylites , we already know ; him and
others , raised aloft . The mere sample , these , of what is coming , of what
continues coming , upwards from the realm of Night ! -- Chaumette , by and
by Anaxagoras Chaumette , one already descries : mellifluous in
street @-@ groups ; not now a sea @-@ boy on the high and giddy mast : a
mellifluous tribune of the common people , with long curling locks ,
on bourne @-@ stone of the thoroughfares ; able sub @-@ editor too ; who shall
rise -- to the very gallows . Clerk Tallien , he also is become sub @-@ editor ;
shall become able editor ; and more . Bibliopolic Momoro , Typographic
Pruhomme see new trades opening . Collot d &apos;Herbois , tearing a passion
to rags , pauses on the Thespian boards ; listens , with that black bushy
head , to the sound of the world &apos;s drama : shall the Mimetic become Real ?
Did ye hiss him , O men of Lyons ? ( Buzot , Memoires ( Paris , 1823 ) , p . 90 . )
Better had ye clapped !

Happy now , indeed , for all manner of mimetic , half @-@ original men ! Tumid
blustering , with more or less of sincerity , which need not be entirely
sincere , yet the sincerer the better , is like to go far . Shall we
say , the Revolution @-@ element works itself rarer and rarer ; so that only
lighter and lighter bodies will float in it ; till at last the mere
blown @-@ bladder is your only swimmer ? Limitation of mind , then vehemence ,
promptitude , audacity , shall all be available ; to which add only
these two : cunning and good lungs . Good fortune must be presupposed .
Accordingly , of all classes the rising one , we observe , is now
the Attorney class : witness Bazires , Carriers , Fouquier @-@ Tinvilles ,
Bazoche @-@ Captain Bourdons : more than enough . Such figures shall Night ,
from her wonder @-@ bearing bosom , emit ; swarm after swarm . Of another
deeper and deepest swarm , not yet dawned on the astonished eye ; of
pilfering Candle @-@ snuffers , Thief @-@ valets , disfrocked Capuchins , and
so many Heberts , Henriots , Ronsins , Rossignols , let us , as long as
possible , forbear speaking .

Thus , over France , all stirs that has what the Physiologists call
irritability in it : how much more all wherein irritability has perfected
itself into vitality ; into actual vision , and force that can will ! All
stirs ; and if not in Paris , flocks thither . Great and greater waxes
President Danton in his Cordeliers Section ; his rhetorical tropes are
all &apos; gigantic : &apos; energy flashes from his black brows , menaces in his
athletic figure , rolls in the sound of his voice &apos; reverberating from the
domes ; &apos; this man also , like Mirabeau , has a natural eye , and begins
to see whither Constitutionalism is tending , though with a wish in it
different from Mirabeau &apos;s .

Remark , on the other hand , how General Dumouriez has quitted Normandy
and the Cherbourg Breakwater , to come -- whither we may guess . It is his
second or even third trial at Paris , since this New Era began ; but
now it is in right earnest , for he has quitted all else . Wiry , elastic
unwearied man ; whose life was but a battle and a march ! No , not a
creature of Choiseul &apos;s ; &quot; the creature of God and of my sword , &quot; -- he
fiercely answered in old days . Overfalling Corsican batteries , in
the deadly fire @-@ hail ; wriggling invincible from under his horse ,
at Closterkamp of the Netherlands , though tethered with &apos; crushed
stirrup @-@ iron and nineteen wounds ; &apos; tough , minatory , standing at bay , as
forlorn hope , on the skirts of Poland ; intriguing , battling in cabinet
and field ; roaming far out , obscure , as King &apos;s spial , or sitting
sealed up , enchanted in Bastille ; fencing , pamphleteering , scheming
and struggling from the very birth of him , ( Dumouriez , Memoires , i . 28,
&amp; c . ) -- the man has come thus far . How repressed , how irrepressible ! Like
some incarnate spirit in prison , which indeed he was ; hewing on granite
walls for deliverance ; striking fire flashes from them . And now has the
general earthquake rent his cavern too ? Twenty years younger , what might
he not have done ! But his hair has a shade of gray : his way of thought
is all fixed , military . He can grow no further , and the new world is
in such growth . We will name him , on the whole , one of Heaven &apos;s Swiss ;
without faith ; wanting above all things work , work on any side . Work
also is appointed him ; and he will do it .

Not from over France only are the unrestful flocking towards Paris ; but
from all sides of Europe . Where the carcase is , thither will the eagles
gather . Think how many a Spanish Guzman , Martinico Fournier named
&apos;Fournier l &apos;Americain , &apos; Engineer Miranda from the very Andes , were
flocking or had flocked ! Walloon Pereyra might boast of the strangest
parentage : him , they say , Prince Kaunitz the Diplomatist heedlessly
dropped ; &apos; like ostrich @-@ egg , to be hatched of Chance -- into an
ostrich @-@ eater ! Jewish or German Freys do business in the great Cesspool
of Agio ; which Cesspool this Assignat @-@ fiat has quickened , into a Mother
of dead dogs . Swiss Claviere could found no Socinian Genevese Colony in
Ireland ; but he paused , years ago , prophetic before the Minister &apos;s Hotel
at Paris ; and said , it was borne on his mind that he one day was to be
Minister , and laughed . ( Dumont , Souvenirs sur Mirabeau , p . 399 . ) Swiss
Pachc , on the other hand , sits sleekheaded , frugal ; the wonder of his
own alley , and even of neighbouring ones , for humility of mind , and a
thought deeper than most men &apos;s : sit there , Tartuffe , till wanted ! Ye
Italian Dufournys , Flemish Prolys , flit hither all ye bipeds of prey !
Come whosesoever head is hot ; thou of mind ungoverned , be it chaos as of
undevelopment or chaos as of ruin ; the man who cannot get known , the man
who is too well known ; if thou have any vendible faculty , nay if
thou have but edacity and loquacity , come ! They come ; with hot
unutterabilities in their heart ; as Pilgrims towards a miraculous
shrine . Nay how many come as vacant Strollers , aimless , of whom Europe
is full merely towards something ! For benighted fowls , when you beat
their bushes , rush towards any light . Thus Frederick Baron Trenck too
is here ; mazed , purblind , from the cells of Magdeburg ; Minotauric cells ,
and his Ariadne lost ! Singular to say , Trenck , in these years , sells
wine ; not indeed in bottle , but in wood .

Nor is our England without her missionaries . She has her live @-@ saving
Needham ; to whom was solemnly presented a &apos; civic sword , &apos; -- long since
rusted into nothingness . Her Paine : rebellious Staymaker ; unkempt ; who
feels that he , a single Needleman , did by his &apos; Common Sense &apos; Pamphlet ,
free America ; -- that he can and will free all this World ; perhaps even
the other . Price @-@ Stanhope Constitutional Association sends over to
congratulate ; ( Moniteur , 10 Novembre , 7 Decembre , 1789 . ) welcomed by
National Assembly , though they are but a London Club ; whom Burke and
Toryism eye askance .

On thee too , for country &apos;s sake , O Chevalier John Paul , be a word spent ,
or misspent ! In faded naval uniform , Paul Jones lingers visible here ;
like a wine @-@ skin from which the wine is all drawn . Like the ghost
of himself ! Low is his once loud bruit ; scarcely audible , save , with
extreme tedium in ministerial ante @-@ chambers ; in this or the other
charitable dining @-@ room , mindful of the past . What changes ; culminatings
and declinings ! Not now , poor Paul , thou lookest wistful over the Solway
brine , by the foot of native Criffel , into blue mountainous Cumberland ,
into blue Infinitude ; environed with thrift , with humble friendliness ;
thyself , young fool , longing to be aloft from it , or even to be away
from it . Yes , beyond that sapphire Promontory , which men name St. Bees ,
which is not sapphire either , but dull sandstone , when one gets close to
it , there is a world . Which world thou too shalt taste of ! -- From yonder
White Haven rise his smoke @-@ clouds ; ominous though ineffectual . Proud
Forth quakes at his bellying sails ; had not the wind suddenly shifted .
Flamborough reapers , homegoing , pause on the hill @-@ side : for what
sulphur @-@ cloud is that that defaces the sleek sea ; sulphur @-@ cloud spitting
streaks of fire ? A sea cockfight it is , and of the hottest ; where
British Serapis and French @-@ American Bon Homme Richard do lash and
throttle each other , in their fashion ; and lo the desperate valour has
suffocated the deliberate , and Paul Jones too is of the Kings of the
Sea !

The Euxine , the Meotian waters felt thee next , and long @-@ skirted Turks ,
O Paul ; and thy fiery soul has wasted itself in thousand
contradictions ; -- to no purpose . For , in far lands , with scarlet
Nassau @-@ Siegens , with sinful Imperial Catherines , is not the
heart @-@ broken , even as at home with the mean ? Poor Paul ! hunger and
dispiritment track thy sinking footsteps : once or at most twice , in this
Revolution @-@ tumult the figure of thee emerges ; mute , ghost @-@ like , as &apos; with
stars dim @-@ twinkling through . &apos; And then , when the light is gone quite
out , a National Legislature grants &apos; ceremonial funeral ! &apos; As good had
been the natural Presbyterian Kirk @-@ bell , and six feet of Scottish earth ,
among the dust of thy loved ones . -- Such world lay beyond the Promontory
of St. Bees . Such is the life of sinful mankind here below .

But of all strangers , far the notablest for us is Baron Jean Baptiste de
Clootz ; -- or , dropping baptisms and feudalisms , World @-@ Citizen Anacharsis
Clootz , from Cleves . Him mark , judicious Reader . Thou hast known his
Uncle , sharp @-@ sighted thorough @-@ going Cornelius de Pauw , who mercilessly
cuts down cherished illusions ; and of the finest antique Spartans , will
make mere modern cutthroat Mainots . ( De Pauw , Recherches sur les Grecs ,
&amp; c . ) The like stuff is in Anacharsis : hot metal ; full of scoriae , which
should and could have been smelted out , but which will not . He has
wandered over this terraqueous Planet ; seeking , one may say , the
Paradise we lost long ago . He has seen English Burke ; has been seen
of the Portugal Inquisition ; has roamed , and fought , and written ; is
writing , among other things , &apos; Evidences of the Mahometan Religion . &apos; But
now , like his Scythian adoptive godfather , he finds himself in the Paris
Athens ; surely , at last , the haven of his soul . A dashing man , beloved
at Patriotic dinner @-@ tables ; with gaiety , nay with humour ; headlong ,
trenchant , of free purse ; in suitable costume ; though what mortal ever
more despised costumes ? Under all costumes Anacharsis seeks the man ; not
Stylites Marat will more freely trample costumes , if they hold no man .
This is the faith of Anacharsis : That there is a Paradise discoverable ;
that all costumes ought to hold men . O Anacharsis , it is a headlong ,
swift @-@ going faith . Mounted thereon , meseems , thou art bound hastily for
the City of Nowhere ; and wilt arrive ! At best , we may say , arrive in
good riding attitude ; which indeed is something .

So many new persons , and new things , have come to occupy this France .
Her old Speech and Thought , and Activity which springs from those , are
all changing ; fermenting towards unknown issues . To the dullest peasant ,
as he sits sluggish , overtoiled , by his evening hearth , one idea has
come : that of Chateaus burnt ; of Chateaus combustible . How altered all
Coffeehouses , in Province or Capital ! The Antre de Procope has now
other questions than the Three Stagyrite Unities to settle ; not
theatre @-@ controversies , but a world @-@ controversy : there , in the ancient
pigtail mode , or with modern Brutus &apos; heads , do well @-@ frizzed logicians
hold hubbub , and Chaos umpire sits . The ever @-@ enduring Melody of Paris
Saloons has got a new ground @-@ tone : ever @-@ enduring ; which has been heard ,
and by the listening Heaven too , since Julian the Apostate &apos;s time and
earlier ; mad now as formerly .

Ex @-@ Censor Suard , Ex @-@ Censor , for we have freedom of the Press ; he may be
seen there ; impartial , even neutral . Tyrant Grimm rolls large eyes ,
over a questionable coming Time . Atheist Naigeon , beloved disciple
of Diderot , crows , in his small difficult way , heralding glad dawn .
( Naigeon : Addresse a l &apos;Assemblee Nationale ( Paris , 1790 ) sur la liberte
des opinions . ) But , on the other hand , how many Morellets , Marmontels ,
who had sat all their life hatching Philosophe eggs , cackle now , in a
state bordering on distraction , at the brood they have brought out !
( See Marmontel , Memoires , passim ; Morellet , Memoires , &amp; c . ) It was so
delightful to have one &apos;s Philosophe Theorem demonstrated , crowned in the
saloons : and now an infatuated people will not continue speculative , but
have Practice ?

There also observe Preceptress Genlis , or Sillery , or
Sillery @-@ Genlis , -- for our husband is both Count and Marquis , and we
have more than one title . Pretentious , frothy ; a puritan yet creedless ;
darkening counsel by words without wisdom ! For , it is in that
thin element of the Sentimentalist and Distinguished @-@ Female that
Sillery @-@ Genlis works ; she would gladly be sincere , yet can grow no
sincerer than sincere @-@ cant : sincere @-@ cant of many forms , ending in the
devotional form . For the present , on a neck still of moderate whiteness ,
she wears as jewel a miniature Bastille , cut on mere sandstone , but
then actual Bastille sandstone . M. le Marquis is one of d &apos;Orleans &apos;s
errandmen ; in National Assembly , and elsewhere . Madame , for her part ,
trains up a youthful d &apos;Orleans generation in what superfinest morality
one can ; gives meanwhile rather enigmatic account of fair Mademoiselle
Pamela , the Daughter whom she has adopted . Thus she , in Palais Royal
saloon ; -- whither , we remark , d &apos;Orleans himself , spite of Lafayette , has
returned from that English &apos; mission &apos; of his : surely no pleasant mission :
for the English would not speak to him ; and Saint Hannah More of
England , so unlike Saint Sillery @-@ Genlis of France , saw him shunned ,
in Vauxhall Gardens , like one pest @-@ struck , ( Hannah More &apos;s Life and
Correspondence , ii. c . 5 . ) and his red @-@ blue impassive visage waxing
hardly a shade bluer .



Chapter 2.1.IV.

Journalism .

As for Constitutionalism , with its National Guards , it is doing what
it can ; and has enough to do : it must , as ever , with one hand wave
persuasively , repressing Patriotism ; and keep the other clenched to
menace Royalty plotters . A most delicate task ; requiring tact .

Thus , if People &apos;s @-@ friend Marat has to @-@ day his writ of &apos; prise de corps ,
or seizure of body , &apos; served on him , and dives out of sight , tomorrow
he is left at large ; or is even encouraged , as a sort of bandog whose
baying may be useful . President Danton , in open Hall , with reverberating
voice , declares that , in a case like Marat &apos;s , &quot; force may be resisted by
force . &quot; Whereupon the Chatelet serves Danton also with a writ ; -- which ,
however , as the whole Cordeliers District responds to it , what Constable
will be prompt to execute ? Twice more , on new occasions , does the
Chatelet launch its writ ; and twice more in vain : the body of Danton
cannot be seized by Chatelet ; he unseized , should he even fly for a
season , shall behold the Chatelet itself flung into limbo .

Municipality and Brissot , meanwhile , are far on with their Municipal
Constitution . The Sixty Districts shall become Forty @-@ eight Sections ;
much shall be adjusted , and Paris have its Constitution . A Constitution
wholly Elective ; as indeed all French Government shall and must be . And
yet , one fatal element has been introduced : that of citoyen actif . No
man who does not pay the marc d &apos;argent , or yearly tax equal to three
days &apos; labour , shall be other than a passive citizen : not the slightest
vote for him ; were he acting , all the year round , with sledge hammer ,
with forest @-@ levelling axe ! Unheard of ! cry Patriot Journals . Yes truly ,
my Patriot Friends , if Liberty , the passion and prayer of all men &apos;s
souls , means Liberty to send your fifty @-@ thousandth part of a new
Tongue @-@ fencer into National Debating @-@ club , then , be the gods witness , ye
are hardly entreated . Oh , if in National Palaver ( as the Africans name
it ) , such blessedness is verily found , what tyrant would deny it to Son
of Adam ! Nay , might there not be a Female Parliament too , with &apos; screams
from the Opposition benches , &apos; and &apos; the honourable Member borne out in
hysterics ? &apos; To a Children &apos;s Parliament would I gladly consent ; or even
lower if ye wished it . Beloved Brothers ! Liberty , one might fear , is
actually , as the ancient wise men said , of Heaven . On this Earth , where ,
thinks the enlightened public , did a brave little Dame de Staal ( not
Necker &apos;s Daughter , but a far shrewder than she ) find the nearest
approach to Liberty ? After mature computation , cool as Dilworth &apos;s , her
answer is , In the Bastille . ( See De Staal : Memoires ( Paris , 1821 ) , i .
169 @-@ 280 . ) &quot; Of Heaven ? &quot; answer many , asking . Wo that they should ask ; for
that is the very misery ! &quot; Of Heaven &quot; means much ; share in the National
Palaver it may , or may as probably not mean .

One Sansculottic bough that cannot fail to flourish is Journalism . The
voice of the People being the voice of God , shall not such divine voice
make itself heard ? To the ends of France ; and in as many dialects as
when the first great Babel was to be built ! Some loud as the lion ; some
small as the sucking dove . Mirabeau himself has his instructive Journal
or Journals , with Geneva hodmen working in them ; and withal has quarrels
enough with Dame le Jay , his Female Bookseller , so ultra @-@ compliant
otherwise . ( See Dumont : Souvenirs , 6 . )

King &apos;s @-@ friend Royou still prints himself . Barrere sheds tears of loyal
sensibility in Break of Day Journal , though with declining sale . But why
is Freron so hot , democratic ; Freron , the King &apos;s @-@ friend &apos;s Nephew ? He has
it by kind , that heat of his : wasp Freron begot him ; Voltaire &apos;s Frelon ;
who fought stinging , while sting and poison @-@ bag were left , were it only
as Reviewer , and over Printed Waste @-@ paper . Constant , illuminative ,
as the nightly lamplighter , issues the useful Moniteur , for it is now
become diurnal : with facts and few commentaries ; official , safe in the
middle : -- its able Editors sunk long since , recoverably or irrecoverably ,
in deep darkness . Acid Loustalot , with his &apos; vigour , &apos; as of young sloes ,
shall never ripen , but die untimely : his Prudhomme , however , will
not let that Revolutions de Paris die ; but edit it himself , with much
else , -- dull @-@ blustering Printer though he be .

Of Cassandra @-@ Marat we have spoken often ; yet the most surprising truth
remains to be spoken : that he actually does not want sense ; but , with
croaking gelid throat , croaks out masses of the truth , on several
things . Nay sometimes , one might almost fancy he had a perception of
humour , and were laughing a little , far down in his inner man . Camille
is wittier than ever , and more outspoken , cynical ; yet sunny as ever . A
light melodious creature ; &apos; born , &apos; as he shall yet say with bitter tears ,
&apos;to write verses ; &apos; light Apollo , so clear , soft @-@ lucent , in this war of
the Titans , wherein he shall not conquer !

Folded and hawked Newspapers exist in all countries ; but , in such a
Journalistic element as this of France , other and stranger sorts are
to be anticipated . What says the English reader to a Journal @-@ Affiche ,
Placard Journal ; legible to him that has no halfpenny ; in bright
prismatic colours , calling the eye from afar ? Such , in the coming
months , as Patriot Associations , public and private , advance , and can
subscribe funds , shall plenteously hang themselves out : leaves , limed
leaves , to catch what they can ! The very Government shall have its
Pasted Journal ; Louvet , busy yet with a new &apos; charming romance , &apos; shall
write Sentinelles , and post them with effect ; nay Bertrand de
Moleville , in his extremity , shall still more cunningly try it . ( See
Bertrand @-@ Moleville : Memoires , ii . 100 , &amp; c . ) Great is Journalism . Is not
every Able Editor a Ruler of the World , being a persuader of it ; though
self @-@ elected , yet sanctioned , by the sale of his Numbers ? Whom indeed
the world has the readiest method of deposing , should need be : that of
merely doing nothing to him ; which ends in starvation !

Nor esteem it small what those Bill @-@ stickers had to do in Paris : above
Three Score of them : all with their crosspoles , haversacks , pastepots ;
nay with leaden badges , for the Municipality licenses them . A Sacred
College , properly of World @-@ rulers &apos; Heralds , though not respected as
such , in an Era still incipient and raw . They made the walls of Paris
didactic , suasive , with an ever fresh Periodical Literature , wherein
he that ran might read : Placard Journals , Placard Lampoons ,
Municipal Ordinances , Royal Proclamations ; the whole other or vulgar
Placard @-@ department super @-@ added , -- or omitted from contempt ! What
unutterable things the stone @-@ walls spoke , during these five years ! But
it is all gone ; To @-@ day swallowing Yesterday , and then being in its
turn swallowed of To @-@ morrow , even as Speech ever is . Nay what , O thou
immortal Man of Letters , is Writing itself but Speech conserved for a
time ? The Placard Journal conserved it for one day ; some Books conserve
it for the matter of ten years ; nay some for three thousand : but what
then ? Why , then , the years being all run , it also dies , and the world
is rid of it . Oh , were there not a spirit in the word of man , as in
man himself , that survived the audible bodied word , and tended either
Godward , or else Devilward for evermore , why should he trouble himself
much with the truth of it , or the falsehood of it , except for commercial
purposes ? His immortality indeed , and whether it shall last half a
lifetime , or a lifetime and half ; is not that a very considerable thing ?
As mortality , was to the runaway , whom Great Fritz bullied back into the
battle with a : &quot; R -- , wollt ihr ewig leben , Unprintable Off @-@ scouring of
Scoundrels , would ye live for ever ! &quot;

This is the Communication of Thought : how happy when there is any
Thought to communicate ! Neither let the simpler old methods be
neglected , in their sphere . The Palais @-@ Royal Tent , a tyrannous
Patrollotism has removed ; but can it remove the lungs of man ? Anaxagoras
Chaumette we saw mounted on bourne @-@ stones , while Tallien worked
sedentary at the subeditorial desk . In any corner of the civilised
world , a tub can be inverted , and an articulate @-@ speaking biped mount
thereon . Nay , with contrivance , a portable trestle , or folding @-@ stool ,
can be procured , for love or money ; this the peripatetic Orator can take
in his hand , and , driven out here , set it up again there ; saying mildly ,
with a Sage Bias , Omnia mea mecum porto .

Such is Journalism , hawked , pasted , spoken . How changed since One
old Metra walked this same Tuileries Garden , in gilt cocked hat , with
Journal at his nose , or held loose @-@ folded behind his back ; and was a
notability of Paris , &apos; Metra the Newsman ; &apos; ( Dulaure , Histoire de Paris ,
viii . 483 ; Mercier , Nouveau Paris , &amp; c . ) and Louis himself was wont to
say : Qu &apos;en dit Metra ? Since the first Venetian News @-@ sheet was sold for a
gazza , or farthing , and named Gazette ! We live in a fertile world .



Chapter 2.1.V.

Clubbism .

Where the heart is full , it seeks , for a thousand reasons , in a thousand
ways , to impart itself . How sweet , indispensable , in such cases , is
fellowship ; soul mystically strengthening soul ! The meditative Germans ,
some think , have been of opinion that Enthusiasm in the general means
simply excessive Congregating -- Schwarmerey , or Swarming . At any rate ,
do we not see glimmering half @-@ red embers , if laid together , get into the
brightest white glow ?

In such a France , gregarious Reunions will needs multiply , intensify ;
French Life will step out of doors , and , from domestic , become a public
Club Life . Old Clubs , which already germinated , grow and flourish ; new
every where bud forth . It is the sure symptom of Social Unrest : in such
way , most infallibly of all , does Social Unrest exhibit itself ; find
solacement , and also nutriment . In every French head there hangs now ,
whether for terror or for hope , some prophetic picture of a New France :
prophecy which brings , nay which almost is , its own fulfilment ; and in
all ways , consciously and unconsciously , works towards that .

Observe , moreover , how the Aggregative Principle , let it be but deep
enough , goes on aggregating , and this even in a geometrical progression :
how when the whole world , in such a plastic time , is forming itself
into Clubs , some One Club , the strongest or luckiest , shall , by friendly
attracting , by victorious compelling , grow ever stronger , till it become
immeasurably strong ; and all the others , with their strength , be either
lovingly absorbed into it , or hostilely abolished by it ! This if the
Club @-@ spirit is universal ; if the time is plastic . Plastic enough is the
time , universal the Club @-@ spirit : such an all absorbing , paramount One
Club cannot be wanting .

What a progress , since the first salient @-@ point of the Breton Committee !
It worked long in secret , not languidly ; it has come with the National
Assembly to Paris ; calls itself Club ; calls itself in imitation , as is
thought , of those generous Price @-@ Stanhope English , French Revolution
Club ; but soon , with more originality , Club of Friends of the
Constitution . Moreover it has leased , for itself , at a fair rent , the
Hall of the Jacobin &apos;s Convent , one of our &apos; superfluous edifices ; &apos; and
does therefrom now , in these spring months , begin shining out on an
admiring Paris . And so , by degrees , under the shorter popular title of
Jacobins &apos; Club , it shall become memorable to all times and lands . Glance
into the interior : strongly yet modestly benched and seated ; as many as
Thirteen Hundred chosen Patriots ; Assembly Members not a few . Barnave ,
the two Lameths are seen there ; occasionally Mirabeau , perpetually
Robespierre ; also the ferret @-@ visage of Fouquier @-@ Tinville with
other attorneys ; Anacharsis of Prussian Scythia , and miscellaneous
Patriots , -- though all is yet in the most perfectly clean @-@ washed state ;
decent , nay dignified . President on platform , President &apos;s bell are
not wanting ; oratorical Tribune high @-@ raised ; nor strangers &apos; galleries ,
wherein also sit women . Has any French Antiquarian Society preserved
that written Lease of the Jacobins Convent Hall ? Or was it , unluckier
even than Magna Charta , clipt by sacrilegious Tailors ? Universal History
is not indifferent to it .

These Friends of the Constitution have met mainly , as their name may
foreshadow , to look after Elections when an Election comes , and procure
fit men ; but likewise to consult generally that the Commonweal take
no damage ; one as yet sees not how . For indeed let two or three gather
together any where , if it be not in Church , where all are bound to the
passive state ; no mortal can say accurately , themselves as little as
any , for what they are gathered . How often has the broached barrel
proved not to be for joy and heart effusion , but for duel and
head @-@ breakage ; and the promised feast become a Feast of the Lapithae !
This Jacobins Club , which at first shone resplendent , and was thought to
be a new celestial Sun for enlightening the Nations , had , as things all
have , to work through its appointed phases : it burned unfortunately more
and more lurid , more sulphurous , distracted ; -- and swam at last , through
the astonished Heaven , like a Tartarean Portent , and lurid @-@ burning
Prison of Spirits in Pain .

Its style of eloquence ? Rejoice , Reader , that thou knowest it not , that
thou canst never perfectly know . The Jacobins published a Journal
of Debates , where they that have the heart may examine : Impassioned ,
full @-@ droning Patriotic @-@ eloquence ; implacable , unfertile -- save for
Destruction , which was indeed its work : most wearisome , though most
deadly . Be thankful that Oblivion covers so much ; that all carrion is
by and by buried in the green Earth &apos;s bosom , and even makes her grow the
greener . The Jacobins are buried ; but their work is not ; it continues
&apos;making the tour of the world , &apos; as it can . It might be seen lately , for
instance , with bared bosom and death @-@ defiant eye , as far on as
Greek Missolonghi ; and , strange enough , old slumbering Hellas was
resuscitated , into somnambulism which will become clear wakefulness , by
a voice from the Rue St. Honore ! All dies , as we often say ; except the
spirit of man , of what man does . Thus has not the very House of the
Jacobins vanished ; scarcely lingering in a few old men &apos;s memories ?
The St. Honore Market has brushed it away , and now where dull @-@ droning
eloquence , like a Trump of Doom , once shook the world , there is pacific
chaffering for poultry and greens . The sacred National Assembly Hall
itself has become common ground ; President &apos;s platform permeable to wain
and dustcart ; for the Rue de Rivoli runs there . Verily , at Cockcrow ( of
this Cock or the other ) , all Apparitions do melt and dissolve in space .

The Paris Jacobins became &apos; the Mother @-@ Society , Societe @-@ Mere ; &apos; and had
as many as &apos; three hundred &apos; shrill @-@ tongued daughters in &apos; direct
correspondence &apos; with her . Of indirectly corresponding , what we may
call grand @-@ daughters and minute progeny , she counted &apos; forty @-@ four
thousand ! &apos; -- But for the present we note only two things : the first
of them a mere anecdote . One night , a couple of brother Jacobins are
doorkeepers ; for the members take this post of duty and honour in
rotation , and admit none that have not tickets : one doorkeeper was the
worthy Sieur Lais , a patriotic Opera @-@ singer , stricken in years , whose
windpipe is long since closed without result ; the other , young , and
named Louis Philippe , d &apos;Orleans &apos;s firstborn , has in this latter time ,
after unheard @-@ of destinies , become Citizen @-@ King , and struggles to rule
for a season . All @-@ flesh is grass ; higher reedgrass or creeping herb .

The second thing we have to note is historical : that the Mother @-@ Society ,
even in this its effulgent period , cannot content all Patriots . Already
it must throw off , so to speak , two dissatisfied swarms ; a swarm to
the right , a swarm to the left . One party , which thinks the Jacobins
lukewarm , constitutes itself into Club of the Cordeliers ; a hotter Club :
it is Danton &apos;s element : with whom goes Desmoulins . The other party ,
again , which thinks the Jacobins scalding @-@ hot , flies off to the right ,
and becomes &apos; Club of 1789 , Friends of the Monarchic Constitution . &apos; They
are afterwards named &apos; Feuillans Club ; &apos; their place of meeting being the
Feuillans Convent . Lafayette is , or becomes , their chief @-@ man ; supported
by the respectable Patriot everywhere , by the mass of Property and
Intelligence , -- with the most flourishing prospects . They , in these June
days of 1790 , do , in the Palais Royal , dine solemnly with open windows ;
to the cheers of the people ; with toasts , with inspiriting songs , -- with
one song at least , among the feeblest ever sung . ( Hist . Parl. vi .
334 . ) They shall , in due time be hooted forth , over the borders , into
Cimmerian Night .

Another expressly Monarchic or Royalist Club , &apos; Club des Monarchiens , &apos;
though a Club of ample funds , and all sitting in damask sofas ,
cannot realise the smallest momentary cheer ; realises only scoffs and
groans ; -- till , ere long , certain Patriots in disorderly sufficient
number , proceed thither , for a night or for nights , and groan it out of
pain . Vivacious alone shall the Mother @-@ Society and her family be . The
very Cordeliers may , as it were , return into her bosom , which will have
grown warm enough .

Fatal @-@ looking ! Are not such Societies an incipient New Order of Society
itself ? The Aggregative Principle anew at work in a Society grown
obsolete , cracked asunder , dissolving into rubbish and primary atoms ?



Chapter 2.1.VI.

Je le jure .

With these signs of the times , is it not surprising that the dominant
feeling all over France was still continually Hope ? O blessed Hope , sole
boon of man ; whereby , on his strait prison walls , are painted beautiful
far @-@ stretching landscapes ; and into the night of very Death is shed
holiest dawn ! Thou art to all an indefeasible possession in this
God &apos;s @-@ world : to the wise a sacred Constantine &apos;s @-@ banner , written on the
eternal skies ; under which they shall conquer , for the battle itself is
victory : to the foolish some secular mirage , or shadow of still waters ,
painted on the parched Earth ; whereby at least their dusty pilgrimage ,
if devious , becomes cheerfuller , becomes possible .

In the death @-@ tumults of a sinking Society , French Hope sees only the
birth @-@ struggles of a new unspeakably better Society ; and sings , with
full assurance of faith , her brisk Melody , which some inspired fiddler
has in these very days composed for her , -- the world @-@ famous ca @-@ ira . Yes ;
&apos;that will go : &apos; and then there will come -- ? All men hope : even Marat
hopes -- that Patriotism will take muff and dirk . King Louis is not
without hope : in the chapter of chances ; in a flight to some Bouille ; in
getting popularized at Paris . But what a hoping People he had , judge by
the fact , and series of facts , now to be noted .

Poor Louis , meaning the best , with little insight and even less
determination of his own , has to follow , in that dim wayfaring of his ,
such signal as may be given him ; by backstairs Royalism , by official or
backstairs Constitutionalism , whichever for the month may have convinced
the royal mind . If flight to Bouille , and ( horrible to think ! ) a drawing
of the civil sword do hang as theory , portentous in the background , much
nearer is this fact of these Twelve Hundred Kings , who sit in the Salle
de Manege . Kings uncontrollable by him , not yet irreverent to him . Could
kind management of these but prosper , how much better were it than armed
Emigrants , Turin @-@ intrigues , and the help of Austria ! Nay , are the two
hopes inconsistent ? Rides in the suburbs , we have found , cost little ;
yet they always brought vivats . ( See Bertrand @-@ Moleville , i . 241 , &amp; c . )
Still cheaper is a soft word ; such as has many times turned away
wrath . In these rapid days , while France is all getting divided into
Departments , Clergy about to be remodelled , Popular Societies
rising , and Feudalism and so much ever is ready to be hurled into the
melting @-@ pot , -- might one not try ?

On the 4th of February , accordingly , M. le President reads to his
National Assembly a short autograph , announcing that his Majesty will
step over , quite in an unceremonious way , probably about noon . Think ,
therefore , Messieurs , what it may mean ; especially , how ye will get the
Hall decorated a little . The Secretaries &apos; Bureau can be shifted down
from the platform ; on the President &apos;s chair be slipped this cover of
velvet , &apos; of a violet colour sprigged with gold fleur @-@ de @-@ lys ; &apos; -- for
indeed M. le President has had previous notice underhand , and taken
counsel with Doctor Guillotin . Then some fraction of &apos; velvet carpet , &apos;
of like texture and colour , cannot that be spread in front of the chair ,
where the Secretaries usually sit ? So has judicious Guillotin advised :
and the effect is found satisfactory . Moreover , as it is probable that
his Majesty , in spite of the fleur @-@ de @-@ lys @-@ velvet , will stand and not sit
at all , the President himself , in the interim , presides standing . And
so , while some honourable Member is discussing , say , the division of a
Department , Ushers announce : &quot; His Majesty ! &quot; In person , with small suite ,
enter Majesty : the honourable Member stops short ; the Assembly starts
to its feet ; the Twelve Hundred Kings &apos; almost all , &apos; and the Galleries no
less , do welcome the Restorer of French Liberty with loyal shouts . His
Majesty &apos;s Speech , in diluted conventional phraseology , expresses this
mainly : That he , most of all Frenchmen , rejoices to see France getting
regenerated ; is sure , at the same time , that they will deal gently
with her in the process , and not regenerate her roughly . Such was his
Majesty &apos;s Speech : the feat he performed was coming to speak it , and
going back again .

Surely , except to a very hoping People , there was not much here to build
upon . Yet what did they not build ! The fact that the King has spoken ,
that he has voluntarily come to speak , how inexpressibly encouraging !
Did not the glance of his royal countenance , like concentrated sunbeams ,
kindle all hearts in an august Assembly ; nay thereby in an inflammable
enthusiastic France ? To move &apos; Deputation of thanks &apos; can be the happy
lot of but one man ; to go in such Deputation the lot of not many . The
Deputed have gone , and returned with what highest @-@ flown compliment they
could ; whom also the Queen met , Dauphin in hand . And still do not our
hearts burn with insatiable gratitude ; and to one other man a still
higher blessedness suggests itself : To move that we all renew the
National Oath .

Happiest honourable Member , with his word so in season as word seldom
was ; magic Fugleman of a whole National Assembly , which sat there
bursting to do somewhat ; Fugleman of a whole onlooking France ! The
President swears ; declares that every one shall swear , in distinct je
le jure . Nay the very Gallery sends him down a written slip signed , with
their Oath on it ; and as the Assembly now casts an eye that way , the
Gallery all stands up and swears again . And then out of doors , consider
at the Hotel @-@ de @-@ Ville how Bailly , the great Tennis @-@ Court swearer ,
again swears , towards nightful , with all the Municipals , and Heads of
Districts assembled there . And &apos; M. Danton suggests that the public would
like to partake : &apos; whereupon Bailly , with escort of Twelve , steps
forth to the great outer staircase ; sways the ebullient multitude with
stretched hand : takes their oath , with a thunder of &apos; rolling drums , &apos;
with shouts that rend the welkin . And on all streets the glad people ,
with moisture and fire in their eyes , &apos; spontaneously formed groups , and
swore one another , &apos; ( Newspapers in Hist . Parl. iv . 445 . ) -- and the whole
City was illuminated . This was the Fourth of February 1790 : a day to be
marked white in Constitutional annals .

Nor is the illumination for a night only , but partially or totally
it lasts a series of nights . For each District , the Electors of each
District , will swear specially ; and always as the District swears ; it
illuminates itself . Behold them , District after District , in some open
square , where the Non @-@ Electing People can all see and join : with
their uplifted right hands , and je le jure : with rolling drums , with
embracings , and that infinite hurrah of the enfranchised , -- which any
tyrant that there may be can consider ! Faithful to the King , to the Law ,
to the Constitution which the National Assembly shall make .

Fancy , for example , the Professors of Universities parading the streets
with their young France , and swearing , in an enthusiastic manner , not
without tumult . By a larger exercise of fancy , expand duly this little
word : The like was repeated in every Town and District of France ! Nay
one Patriot Mother , in Lagnon of Brittany , assembles her ten children ;
and , with her own aged hand , swears them all herself , the highsouled
venerable woman . Of all which , moreover , a National Assembly must be
eloquently apprised . Such three weeks of swearing ! Saw the sun ever such
a swearing people ? Have they been bit by a swearing tarantula ? No : but
they are men and Frenchmen ; they have Hope ; and , singular to say , they
have Faith , were it only in the Gospel according to Jean Jacques . O my
Brothers ! would to Heaven it were even as ye think and have sworn !
But there are Lovers &apos; Oaths , which , had they been true as love itself ,
cannot be kept ; not to speak of Dicers &apos; Oaths , also a known sort .



Chapter 2.1.VII.

Prodigies .

To such length had the Contrat Social brought it , in believing hearts .
Man , as is well said , lives by faith ; each generation has its own
faith , more or less ; and laughs at the faith of its predecessor , -- most
unwisely . Grant indeed that this faith in the Social Contract belongs
to the stranger sorts ; that an unborn generation may very wisely , if
not laugh , yet stare at it , and piously consider . For , alas , what is
Contrat ? If all men were such that a mere spoken or sworn Contract would
bind them , all men were then true men , and Government a superfluity . Not
what thou and I have promised to each other , but what the balance of our
forces can make us perform to each other : that , in so sinful a world
as ours , is the thing to be counted on . But above all , a People and a
Sovereign promising to one another ; as if a whole People , changing
from generation to generation , nay from hour to hour , could ever by any
method be made to speak or promise ; and to speak mere solecisms : &quot; We ,
be the Heavens witness , which Heavens however do no miracles now ; we ,
ever @-@ changing Millions , will allow thee , changeful Unit , to force us or
govern us ! &quot; The world has perhaps seen few faiths comparable to that .

So nevertheless had the world then construed the matter . Had they not so
construed it , how different had their hopes been , their attempts , their
results ! But so and not otherwise did the Upper Powers will it to be .
Freedom by Social Contract : such was verily the Gospel of that Era . And
all men had believed in it , as in a Heaven &apos;s Glad @-@ tidings men should ;
and with overflowing heart and uplifted voice clave to it , and stood
fronting Time and Eternity on it . Nay smile not ; or only with a smile
sadder than tears ! This too was a better faith than the one it had
replaced : than faith merely in the Everlasting Nothing and man &apos;s
Digestive Power ; lower than which no faith can go .

Not that such universally prevalent , universally jurant , feeling of
Hope , could be a unanimous one . Far from that ! The time was ominous :
social dissolution near and certain ; social renovation still a problem ,
difficult and distant even though sure . But if ominous to some clearest
onlooker , whose faith stood not with one side or with the other , nor
in the ever @-@ vexed jarring of Greek with Greek at all , -- how unspeakably
ominous to dim Royalist participators ; for whom Royalism was Mankind &apos;s
palladium ; for whom , with the abolition of Most @-@ Christian Kingship and
Most @-@ Talleyrand Bishopship , all loyal obedience , all religious faith
was to expire , and final Night envelope the Destinies of Man ! On serious
hearts , of that persuasion , the matter sinks down deep ; prompting , as
we have seen , to backstairs Plots , to Emigration with pledge of war , to
Monarchic Clubs ; nay to still madder things .

The Spirit of Prophecy , for instance , had been considered extinct for
some centuries : nevertheless these last @-@ times , as indeed is the tendency
of last @-@ times , do revive it ; that so , of French mad things , we might
have sample also of the maddest . In remote rural districts , whither
Philosophism has not yet radiated , where a heterodox Constitution of
the Clergy is bringing strife round the altar itself , and the very
Church @-@ bells are getting melted into small money @-@ coin , it appears
probable that the End of the World cannot be far off . Deep @-@ musing
atrabiliar old men , especially old women , hint in an obscure way that
they know what they know . The Holy Virgin , silent so long , has not gone
dumb ; -- and truly now , if ever more in this world , were the time for her
to speak . One Prophetess , though careless Historians have omitted her
name , condition , and whereabout , becomes audible to the general ear ;
credible to not a few : credible to Friar Gerle , poor Patriot Chartreux ,
in the National Assembly itself ! She , in Pythoness &apos; recitative , with
wildstaring eye , sings that there shall be a Sign ; that the heavenly Sun
himself will hang out a Sign , or Mock @-@ Sun , -- which , many say , shall be
stamped with the Head of hanged Favras . List , Dom Gerle , with that poor
addled poll of thine ; list , O list ; -- and hear nothing . ( Deux Amis , v. c .
7 . )

Notable however was that &apos; magnetic vellum , velin magnetique , &apos; of the
Sieurs d &apos;Hozier and Petit @-@ Jean , Parlementeers of Rouen . Sweet
young d &apos;Hozier , &apos; bred in the faith of his Missal , and of parchment
genealogies , &apos; and of parchment generally : adust , melancholic ,
middle @-@ aged Petit @-@ Jean : why came these two to Saint @-@ Cloud , where his
Majesty was hunting , on the festival of St. Peter and St. Paul ; and
waited there , in antechambers , a wonder to whispering Swiss , the
livelong day ; and even waited without the Grates , when turned out ; and
had dismissed their valets to Paris , as with purpose of endless waiting ?
They have a magnetic vellum , these two ; whereon the Virgin , wonderfully
clothing herself in Mesmerean Cagliostric Occult @-@ Philosophy ,
has inspired them to jot down instructions and predictions for a
much @-@ straitened King . To whom , by Higher Order , they will this day
present it ; and save the Monarchy and World . Unaccountable pair of
visual @-@ objects ! Ye should be men , and of the Eighteenth Century ; but
your magnetic vellum forbids us so to interpret . Say , are ye aught ?
Thus ask the Guardhouse Captains , the Mayor of St. Cloud ; nay , at great
length , thus asks the Committee of Researches , and not the Municipal ,
but the National Assembly one . No distinct answer , for weeks . At last it
becomes plain that the right answer is negative . Go , ye Chimeras , with
your magnetic vellum ; sweet young Chimera , adust middle @-@ aged one ! The
Prison @-@ doors are open . Hardly again shall ye preside the Rouen Chamber
of Accounts ; but vanish obscurely into Limbo . ( See Deux Amis , v. 199 . )



Chapter 2.1.VIII.

Solemn League and Covenant .

Such dim masses , and specks of even deepest black , work in that
white @-@ hot glow of the French mind , now wholly in fusion , and confusion .
Old women here swearing their ten children on the new Evangel of Jean
Jacques ; old women there looking up for Favras &apos; Heads in the celestial
Luminary : these are preternatural signs , prefiguring somewhat .

In fact , to the Patriot children of Hope themselves , it is undeniable
that difficulties exist : emigrating Seigneurs ; Parlements in sneaking
but most malicious mutiny ( though the rope is round their neck ) ; above
all , the most decided &apos; deficiency of grains . &apos; Sorrowful : but , to a
Nation that hopes , not irremediable . To a Nation which is in fusion
and ardent communion of thought ; which , for example , on signal of one
Fugleman , will lift its right hand like a drilled regiment , and swear
and illuminate , till every village from Ardennes to the Pyrenees has
rolled its village @-@ drum , and sent up its little oath , and glimmer of
tallow @-@ illumination some fathoms into the reign of Night !

If grains are defective , the fault is not of Nature or National
Assembly , but of Art and Antinational Intriguers . Such malign
individuals , of the scoundrel species , have power to vex us , while the
Constitution is a @-@ making . Endure it , ye heroic Patriots : nay rather ,
why not cure it ? Grains do grow , they lie extant there in sheaf or sack ;
only that regraters and Royalist plotters , to provoke the people into
illegality , obstruct the transport of grains . Quick , ye organised
Patriot Authorities , armed National Guards , meet together ; unite your
goodwill ; in union is tenfold strength : let the concentred flash of your
Patriotism strike stealthy Scoundrelism blind , paralytic , as with a coup
de soleil .

Under which hat or nightcap of the Twenty @-@ five millions , this pregnant
Idea first rose , for in some one head it did rise , no man can now say .
A most small idea , near at hand for the whole world : but a living one ,
fit ; and which waxed , whether into greatness or not , into immeasurable
size . When a Nation is in this state that the Fugleman can operate on
it , what will the word in season , the act in season , not do ! It will
grow verily , like the Boy &apos;s Bean in the Fairy @-@ Tale , heaven @-@ high , with
habitations and adventures on it , in one night . It is nevertheless
unfortunately still a Bean ( for your long @-@ lived Oak grows not so ) ;
and , the next night , it may lie felled , horizontal , trodden into common
mud . -- But remark , at least , how natural to any agitated Nation , which
has Faith , this business of Covenanting is . The Scotch , believing in a
righteous Heaven above them , and also in a Gospel , far other than the
Jean @-@ Jacques one , swore , in their extreme need , a Solemn League and
Covenant , -- as Brothers on the forlorn @-@ hope , and imminence of battle , who
embrace looking Godward ; and got the whole Isle to swear it ; and even ,
in their tough Old @-@ Saxon Hebrew @-@ Presbyterian way , to keep it more or
less ; -- for the thing , as such things are , was heard in Heaven , and
partially ratified there ; neither is it yet dead , if thou wilt look , nor
like to die . The French too , with their Gallic @-@ Ethnic excitability and
effervescence , have , as we have seen , real Faith , of a sort ; they are
hard bestead , though in the middle of Hope : a National Solemn League
and Covenant there may be in France too ; under how different conditions ;
with how different developement and issue !

Note , accordingly , the small commencement ; first spark of a mighty
firework : for if the particular hat cannot be fixed upon , the particular
District can . On the 29th day of last November , were National Guards by
the thousand seen filing , from far and near , with military music ,
with Municipal officers in tricolor sashes , towards and along the
Rhone @-@ stream , to the little town of Etoile . There with ceremonial
evolution and manoeuvre , with fanfaronading , musketry @-@ salvoes , and what
else the Patriot genius could devise , they made oath and obtestation to
stand faithfully by one another , under Law and King ; in particular , to
have all manner of grains , while grains there were , freely circulated ,
in spite both of robber and regrater . This was the meeting of Etoile , in
the mild end of November 1789 .

But now , if a mere empty Review , followed by Review @-@ dinner , ball , and
such gesticulation and flirtation as there may be , interests the happy
County @-@ town , and makes it the envy of surrounding County @-@ towns , how much
more might this ! In a fortnight , larger Montelimart , half ashamed of
itself , will do as good , and better . On the Plain of Montelimart ,
or what is equally sonorous , &apos; under the Walls of Montelimart , &apos; the
thirteenth of December sees new gathering and obtestation ; six thousand
strong ; and now indeed , with these three remarkable improvements , as
unanimously resolved on there . First that the men of Montelimart
do federate with the already federated men of Etoile . Second , that ,
implying not expressing the circulation of grain , they &apos; swear in
the face of God and their Country &apos; with much more emphasis and
comprehensiveness , &apos; to obey all decrees of the National Assembly ,
and see them obeyed , till death , jusqu &apos;a la mort . &apos; Third , and most
important , that official record of all this be solemnly delivered in
to the National Assembly , to M. de Lafayette , and &apos; to the Restorer of
French Liberty ; &apos; who shall all take what comfort from it they can . Thus
does larger Montelimart vindicate its Patriot importance , and maintain
its rank in the municipal scale . ( Hist . Parl. vii . 4 . )

And so , with the New @-@ year , the signal is hoisted ; for is not a National
Assembly , and solemn deliverance there , at lowest a National Telegraph ?
Not only grain shall circulate , while there is grain , on highways or
the Rhone @-@ waters , over all that South @-@ Eastern region , -- where also if
Monseigneur d &apos;Artois saw good to break in from Turin , hot welcome might
wait him ; but whatsoever Province of France is straitened for grain , or
vexed with a mutinous Parlement , unconstitutional plotters , Monarchic
Clubs , or any other Patriot ailment , -- can go and do likewise , or even do
better . And now , especially , when the February swearing has set them all
agog ! From Brittany to Burgundy , on most plains of France , under
most City @-@ walls , it is a blaring of trumpets , waving of banners , a
constitutional manoeuvring : under the vernal skies , while Nature too
is putting forth her green Hopes , under bright sunshine defaced by the
stormful East ; like Patriotism victorious , though with difficulty , over
Aristocracy and defect of grain ! There march and constitutionally
wheel , to the ca @-@ ira @-@ ing mood of fife and drum , under their tricolor
Municipals , our clear @-@ gleaming Phalanxes ; or halt , with uplifted
right @-@ hand , and artillery @-@ salvoes that imitate Jove &apos;s thunder ; and
all the Country , and metaphorically all &apos; the Universe , &apos; is looking on .
Wholly , in their best apparel , brave men , and beautifully dizened women ,
most of whom have lovers there ; swearing , by the eternal Heavens and
this green @-@ growing all @-@ nutritive Earth , that France is free !

Sweetest days , when ( astonishing to say ) mortals have actually met
together in communion and fellowship ; and man , were it only once
through long despicable centuries , is for moments verily the brother of
man ! -- And then the Deputations to the National Assembly , with highflown
descriptive harangue ; to M. de Lafayette , and the Restorer ; very
frequently moreover to the Mother of Patriotism sitting on her stout
benches in that Hall of the Jacobins ! The general ear is filled with
Federation . New names of Patriots emerge , which shall one day become
familiar : Boyer @-@ Fonfrede eloquent denunciator of a rebellious Bourdeaux
Parlement ; Max Isnard eloquent reporter of the Federation of Draguignan ;
eloquent pair , separated by the whole breadth of France , who are
nevertheless to meet . Ever wider burns the flame of Federation ; ever
wider and also brighter . Thus the Brittany and Anjou brethren mention
a Fraternity of all true Frenchmen ; and go the length of invoking
&apos;perdition and death &apos; on any renegade : moreover , if in their
National @-@ Assembly harangue , they glance plaintively at the marc d &apos;argent
which makes so many citizens passive , they , over in the Mother @-@ Society ,
ask , being henceforth themselves &apos; neither Bretons nor Angevins but
French , &apos; Why all France has not one Federation , and universal Oath of
Brotherhood , once for all ? ( Reports , &amp; c . ( in Hist . Parl. ix . 122 @-@ 147 ) . )
A most pertinent suggestion ; dating from the end of March . Which
pertinent suggestion the whole Patriot world cannot but catch , and
reverberate and agitate till it become loud ; -- which , in that case , the
Townhall Municipals had better take up , and meditate .

Some universal Federation seems inevitable : the Where is given ; clearly
Paris : only the When , the How ? These also productive Time will give ; is
already giving . For always as the Federative work goes on , it perfects
itself , and Patriot genius adds contribution after contribution . Thus ,
at Lyons , in the end of the May month , we behold as many as fifty , or
some say sixty thousand , met to federate ; and a multitude looking on ,
which it would be difficult to number . From dawn to dusk ! For our Lyons
Guardsmen took rank , at five in the bright dewy morning ; came pouring
in , bright @-@ gleaming , to the Quai de Rhone , to march thence to the
Federation @-@ field ; amid wavings of hats and lady @-@ handkerchiefs ; glad
shoutings of some two hundred thousand Patriot voices and hearts ;
the beautiful and brave ! Among whom , courting no notice , and yet the
notablest of all , what queenlike Figure is this ; with her escort of
house @-@ friends and Champagneux the Patriot Editor ; come abroad with the
earliest ? Radiant with enthusiasm are those dark eyes , is that strong
Minerva @-@ face , looking dignity and earnest joy ; joyfullest she where
all are joyful . It is Roland de la Platriere &apos;s Wife ! ( Madame Roland ,
Memoires , i . ( Discours Preliminaire , p . 23 ) . ) Strict elderly Roland ,
King &apos;s Inspector of Manufactures here ; and now likewise , by popular
choice , the strictest of our new Lyons Municipals : a man who has gained
much , if worth and faculty be gain ; but above all things , has gained to
wife Phlipon the Paris Engraver &apos;s daughter . Reader , mark that queenlike
burgher @-@ woman : beautiful , Amazonian @-@ graceful to the eye ; more so to the
mind . Unconscious of her worth ( as all worth is ) , of her greatness , of
her crystal clearness ; genuine , the creature of Sincerity and Nature ,
in an age of Artificiality , Pollution and Cant ; there , in her still
completeness , in her still invincibility , she , if thou knew it , is the
noblest of all living Frenchwomen , -- and will be seen , one day . O blessed
rather while unseen , even of herself ! For the present she gazes , nothing
doubting , into this grand theatricality ; and thinks her young dreams are
to be fulfilled .

From dawn to dusk , as we said , it lasts ; and truly a sight like
few . Flourishes of drums and trumpets are something : but think of an
&apos;artificial Rock fifty feet high , &apos; all cut into crag @-@ steps , not without
the similitude of &apos; shrubs ! &apos; The interior cavity , for in sooth it is
made of deal , -- stands solemn , a &apos; Temple of Concord : &apos; on the outer summit
rises &apos; a Statue of Liberty , &apos; colossal , seen for miles , with her Pike and
Phrygian Cap , and civic column ; at her feet a Country &apos;s Altar , &apos; Autel de
la Patrie : &apos; -- on all which neither deal @-@ timber nor lath and plaster , with
paint of various colours , have been spared . But fancy then the banners
all placed on the steps of the Rock ; high @-@ mass chaunted ; and the civic
oath of fifty thousand : with what volcanic outburst of sound from iron
and other throats , enough to frighten back the very Saone and Rhone ; and
how the brightest fireworks , and balls , and even repasts closed in that
night of the gods ! ( Hist . Parl. xii . 274 . ) And so the Lyons Federation
vanishes too , swallowed of darkness ; -- and yet not wholly , for our brave
fair Roland was there ; also she , though in the deepest privacy , writes
her Narrative of it in Champagneux &apos;s Courier de Lyons ; a piece which
&apos;circulates to the extent of sixty thousand ; &apos; which one would like now
to read .

But on the whole , Paris , we may see , will have little to devise ; will
only have to borrow and apply . And then as to the day , what day of all
the calendar is fit , if the Bastille Anniversary be not ? The particular
spot too , it is easy to see , must be the Champ @-@ de @-@ Mars ; where many a
Julian the Apostate has been lifted on bucklers , to France &apos;s or the
world &apos;s sovereignty ; and iron Franks , loud @-@ clanging , have responded to
the voice of a Charlemagne ; and from of old mere sublimities have been
familiar .



Chapter 2.1.IX.

Symbolic .

How natural , in all decisive circumstances , is Symbolic Representation
to all kinds of men ! Nay , what is man &apos;s whole terrestrial Life but a
Symbolic Representation , and making visible , of the Celestial invisible
Force that is in him ? By act and world he strives to do it ; with
sincerity , if possible ; failing that , with theatricality , which latter
also may have its meaning . An Almack &apos;s Masquerade is not nothing ; in
more genial ages , your Christmas Guisings , Feasts of the Ass , Abbots
of Unreason , were a considerable something : since sport they were ; as
Almacks may still be sincere wish for sport . But what , on the other
hand , must not sincere earnest have been : say , a Hebrew Feast of
Tabernacles have been ! A whole Nation gathered , in the name of the
Highest , under the eye of the Highest ; imagination herself flagging
under the reality ; and all noblest Ceremony as yet not grown ceremonial ,
but solemn , significant to the outmost fringe ! Neither , in modern
private life , are theatrical scenes , of tearful women wetting whole ells
of cambric in concert , of impassioned bushy @-@ whiskered youth threatening
suicide , and such like , to be so entirely detested : drop thou a tear
over them thyself rather .

At any rate , one can remark that no Nation will throw @-@ by its work , and
deliberately go out to make a scene , without meaning something thereby .
For indeed no scenic individual , with knavish hypocritical views , will
take the trouble to soliloquise a scene : and now consider , is not a
scenic Nation placed precisely in that predicament of soliloquising ;
for its own behoof alone ; to solace its own sensibilities , maudlin or
other ? -- Yet in this respect , of readiness for scenes , the difference of
Nations , as of men , is very great . If our Saxon @-@ Puritanic friends , for
example , swore and signed their National Covenant , without discharge of
gunpowder , or the beating of any drum , in a dingy Covenant @-@ Close of the
Edinburgh High @-@ street , in a mean room , where men now drink mean
liquor , it was consistent with their ways so to swear it . Our
Gallic @-@ Encyclopedic friends , again , must have a Champ @-@ de @-@ Mars , seen of
all the world , or universe ; and such a Scenic Exhibition , to which the
Coliseum Amphitheatre was but a stroller &apos;s barn , as this old Globe
of ours had never or hardly ever beheld . Which method also we reckon
natural , then and there . Nor perhaps was the respective keeping of these
two Oaths far out of due proportion to such respective display in taking
them : inverse proportion , namely . For the theatricality of a People goes
in a compound @-@ ratio : ratio indeed of their trustfulness , sociability ,
fervency ; but then also of their excitability , of their porosity , not
continent ; or say , of their explosiveness , hot @-@ flashing , but which does
not last .

How true also , once more , is it that no man or Nation of men , conscious
of doing a great thing , was ever , in that thing , doing other than a
small one ! O Champ @-@ de @-@ Mars Federation , with three hundred drummers ,
twelve hundred wind @-@ musicians , and artillery planted on height after
height to boom the tidings of it all over France , in few minutes ! Could
no Atheist @-@ Naigeon contrive to discern , eighteen centuries off , those
Thirteen most poor mean @-@ dressed men , at frugal Supper , in a mean Jewish
dwelling , with no symbol but hearts god @-@ initiated into the &apos; Divine depth
of Sorrow , &apos; and a Do this in remembrance of me ; -- and so cease that small
difficult crowing of his , if he were not doomed to it ?



Chapter 2.1.X.

Mankind .

Pardonable are human theatricalities ; nay perhaps touching , like the
passionate utterance of a tongue which with sincerity stammers ; of a
head which with insincerity babbles , -- having gone distracted . Yet ,
in comparison with unpremeditated outbursts of Nature , such as an
Insurrection of Women , how foisonless , unedifying , undelightful ; like
small ale palled , like an effervescence that has effervesced ! Such
scenes , coming of forethought , were they world @-@ great , and never so
cunningly devised , are at bottom mainly pasteboard and paint . But the
others are original ; emitted from the great everliving heart of Nature
herself : what figure they will assume is unspeakably significant . To us ,
therefore , let the French National Solemn League , and Federation , be the
highest recorded triumph of the Thespian Art ; triumphant surely , since
the whole Pit , which was of Twenty @-@ five Millions , not only claps hands ,
but does itself spring on the boards and passionately set to playing
there . And being such , be it treated as such : with sincere cursory
admiration ; with wonder from afar . A whole Nation gone mumming deserves
so much ; but deserves not that loving minuteness a Menadic Insurrection
did . Much more let prior , and as it were , rehearsal scenes of Federation
come and go , henceforward , as they list ; and , on Plains and under
City @-@ walls , innumerable regimental bands blare off into the Inane ,
without note from us .

One scene , however , the hastiest reader will momentarily pause on : that
of Anacharsis Clootz and the Collective sinful Posterity of Adam . -- For
a Patriot Municipality has now , on the 4th of June , got its plan
concocted , and got it sanctioned by National Assembly ; a Patriot King
assenting ; to whom , were he even free to dissent , Federative harangues ,
overflowing with loyalty , have doubtless a transient sweetness . There
shall come Deputed National Guards , so many in the hundred , from each
of the Eighty @-@ three Departments of France . Likewise from all Naval and
Military King &apos;s Forces , shall Deputed quotas come ; such Federation
of National with Royal Soldier has , taking place spontaneously , been
already seen and sanctioned . For the rest , it is hoped , as many as forty
thousand may arrive : expenses to be borne by the Deputing District ;
of all which let District and Department take thought , and elect fit
men , -- whom the Paris brethren will fly to meet and welcome .

Now , therefore , judge if our Patriot Artists are busy ; taking deep
counsel how to make the Scene worthy of a look from the Universe ! As
many as fifteen thousand men , spade @-@ men , barrow @-@ men , stone @-@ builders ,
rammers , with their engineers , are at work on the Champ @-@ de @-@ Mars ;
hollowing it out into a natural Amphitheatre , fit for such solemnity .
For one may hope it will be annual and perennial ; a &apos; Feast of Pikes ,
Fete des Piques , &apos; notablest among the high @-@ tides of the year : in any
case ought not a Scenic free Nation to have some permanent National
Amphitheatre ? The Champ @-@ de @-@ Mars is getting hollowed out ; and the daily
talk and the nightly dream in most Parisian heads is of Federation , and
that only . Federate Deputies are already under way . National Assembly ,
what with its natural work , what with hearing and answering harangues
of Federates , of this Federation , will have enough to do ! Harangue of
&apos;American Committee , &apos; among whom is that faint figure of Paul Jones &apos; as
with the stars dim @-@ twinkling through it , &apos; -- come to congratulate us on
the prospect of such auspicious day . Harangue of Bastille Conquerors ,
come to &apos; renounce &apos; any special recompense , any peculiar place at the
solemnity ; -- since the Centre Grenadiers rather grumble . Harangue of
&apos;Tennis @-@ Court Club , &apos; who enter with far @-@ gleaming Brass @-@ plate , aloft on
a pole , and the Tennis @-@ Court Oath engraved thereon ; which far gleaming
Brass @-@ plate they purpose to affix solemnly in the Versailles original
locality , on the 20th of this month , which is the anniversary , as a
deathless memorial , for some years : they will then dine , as they come
back , in the Bois de Boulogne ; ( See Deux Amis , v. 122 ; Hist . Parl .
&amp; c . ) -- cannot , however , do it without apprising the world . To such things
does the august National Assembly ever and anon cheerfully listen ,
suspending its regenerative labours ; and with some touch of impromptu
eloquence , make friendly reply ; -- as indeed the wont has long been ; for
it is a gesticulating , sympathetic People , and has a heart , and wears it
on its sleeve .

In which circumstances , it occurred to the mind of Anacharsis Clootz
that while so much was embodying itself into Club or Committee , and
perorating applauded , there yet remained a greater and greatest ; of
which , if it also took body and perorated , what might not the effect be :
Humankind namely , le Genre Humain itself ! In what rapt creative moment
the Thought rose in Anacharsis &apos;s soul ; all his throes , while he went
about giving shape and birth to it ; how he was sneered at by cold
worldlings ; but did sneer again , being a man of polished sarcasm ; and
moved to and fro persuasive in coffeehouse and soiree , and dived down
assiduous @-@ obscure in the great deep of Paris , making his Thought a Fact :
of all this the spiritual biographies of that period say nothing . Enough
that on the 19th evening of June 1790 , the Sun &apos;s slant rays lighted a
spectacle such as our foolish little Planet has not often had to show :
Anacharsis Clootz entering the august Salle de Manege , with the Human
Species at his heels . Swedes , Spaniards , Polacks ; Turks , Chaldeans ,
Greeks , dwellers in Mesopotamia : behold them all ; they have come to
claim place in the grand Federation , having an undoubted interest in it .

&quot; Our ambassador titles , &quot; said the fervid Clootz , &quot; are not written
on parchment , but on the living hearts of all men . &quot; These whiskered
Polacks , long @-@ flowing turbaned Ishmaelites , astrological Chaldeans ,
who stand so mute here , let them plead with you , august Senators , more
eloquently than eloquence could . They are the mute representatives of
their tongue @-@ tied , befettered , heavy @-@ laden Nations ; who from out of
that dark bewilderment gaze wistful , amazed , with half @-@ incredulous hope ,
towards you , and this your bright light of a French Federation : bright
particular day @-@ star , the herald of universal day . We claim to stand
there , as mute monuments , pathetically adumbrative of much . -- From bench
and gallery comes &apos; repeated applause ; &apos; for what august Senator but is
flattered even by the very shadow of Human Species depending on him ?
From President Sieyes , who presides this remarkable fortnight , in spite
of his small voice , there comes eloquent though shrill reply . Anacharsis
and the &apos; Foreigners Committee &apos; shall have place at the Federation ; on
condition of telling their respective Peoples what they see there . In
the mean time , we invite them to the &apos; honours of the sitting , honneur
de la seance . &apos; A long @-@ flowing Turk , for rejoinder , bows with Eastern
solemnity , and utters articulate sounds : but owing to his imperfect
knowledge of the French dialect , ( Moniteur , &amp; c . ( in Hist . Parl. xii .
283 ) . ) his words are like spilt water ; the thought he had in him remains
conjectural to this day .

Anacharsis and Mankind accept the honours of the sitting ; and have
forthwith , as the old Newspapers still testify , the satisfaction to see
several things . First and chief , on the motion of Lameth , Lafayette ,
Saint @-@ Fargeau and other Patriot Nobles , let the others repugn as they
will : all Titles of Nobility , from Duke to Esquire , or lower , are
henceforth abolished . Then , in like manner , Livery Servants , or rather
the Livery of Servants . Neither , for the future , shall any man or woman ,
self @-@ styled noble , be &apos; incensed , &apos; -- foolishly fumigated with incense , in
Church ; as the wont has been . In a word , Feudalism being dead these ten
months , why should her empty trappings and scutcheons survive ? The very
Coats @-@ of @-@ arms will require to be obliterated ; -- and yet Cassandra
Marat on this and the other coach @-@ panel notices that they &apos; are but
painted @-@ over , &apos; and threaten to peer through again .

So that henceforth de Lafayette is but the Sieur Motier , and
Saint @-@ Fargeau is plain Michel Lepelletier ; and Mirabeau soon after
has to say huffingly , &quot; With your Riquetti you have set Europe at
cross @-@ purposes for three days . &quot; For his Counthood is not indifferent to
this man ; which indeed the admiring People treat him with to the last .
But let extreme Patriotism rejoice , and chiefly Anacharsis and Mankind ;
for now it seems to be taken for granted that one Adam is Father of us
all ! --

Such was , in historical accuracy , the famed feat of Anacharsis . Thus did
the most extensive of Public Bodies find a sort of spokesman . Whereby at
least we may judge of one thing : what a humour the once sniffing mocking
City of Paris and Baron Clootz had got into ; when such exhibition could
appear a propriety , next door to a sublimity . It is true , Envy did
in after times , pervert this success of Anacharsis ; making him , from
incidental &apos; Speaker of the Foreign @-@ Nations Committee , &apos; claim to be
official permanent &apos; Speaker , Orateur , of the Human Species , &apos; which he
only deserved to be ; and alleging , calumniously , that his astrological
Chaldeans , and the rest , were a mere French tag @-@ rag @-@ and @-@ bobtail
disguised for the nonce ; and , in short , sneering and fleering at him
in her cold barren way ; all which , however , he , the man he was , could
receive on thick enough panoply , or even rebound therefrom , and also go
his way .

Most extensive of Public Bodies , we may call it ; and also the most
unexpected : for who could have thought to see All Nations in the
Tuileries Riding @-@ Hall ? But so it is ; and truly as strange things may
happen when a whole People goes mumming and miming . Hast not thou
thyself perchance seen diademed Cleopatra , daughter of the Ptolemies ,
pleading , almost with bended knee , in unheroic tea @-@ parlour , or dimlit
retail @-@ shop , to inflexible gross Burghal Dignitary , for leave to
reign and die ; being dressed for it , and moneyless , with small
children ; -- while suddenly Constables have shut the Thespian barn , and
her Antony pleaded in vain ? Such visual spectra flit across this Earth ,
if the Thespian Stage be rudely interfered with : but much more , when ,
as was said , Pit jumps on Stage , then is it verily , as in Herr Tieck &apos;s
Drama , a Verkehrte Welt , of World Topsyturvied !

Having seen the Human Species itself , to have seen the &apos; Dean of the
Human Species , &apos; ceased now to be a miracle . Such &apos; Doyen du Genre Humain ,
Eldest of Men , &apos; had shewn himself there , in these weeks : Jean Claude
Jacob , a born Serf , deputed from his native Jura Mountains to thank the
National Assembly for enfranchising them . On his bleached worn face are
ploughed the furrowings of one hundred and twenty years . He has heard
dim patois @-@ talk , of immortal Grand @-@ Monarch victories ; of a burnt
Palatinate , as he toiled and moiled to make a little speck of this Earth
greener ; of Cevennes Dragoonings ; of Marlborough going to the war . Four
generations have bloomed out , and loved and hated , and rustled off :
he was forty @-@ six when Louis Fourteenth died . The Assembly , as one man ,
spontaneously rose , and did reverence to the Eldest of the World ; old
Jean is to take seance among them , honourably , with covered head .
He gazes feebly there , with his old eyes , on that new wonder @-@ scene ;
dreamlike to him , and uncertain , wavering amid fragments of old memories
and dreams . For Time is all growing unsubstantial , dreamlike ; Jean &apos;s
eyes and mind are weary , and about to close , -- and open on a far other
wonder @-@ scene , which shall be real . Patriot Subscription , Royal Pension
was got for him , and he returned home glad ; but in two months more he
left it all , and went on his unknown way . ( Deux Amis , iv. iii . )



Chapter 2.1.XI.

As in the Age of Gold .

Meanwhile to Paris , ever going and returning , day after day , and all day
long , towards that Field of Mars , it becomes painfully apparent that the
spadework there cannot be got done in time . There is such an area of it ;
three hundred thousand square feet : for from the Ecole militaire ( which
will need to be done up in wood with balconies and galleries ) westward
to the Gate by the river ( where also shall be wood , in triumphal
arches ) , we count same thousand yards of length ; and for breadth ,
from this umbrageous Avenue of eight rows , on the South side , to that
corresponding one on the North , some thousand feet , more or less . All
this to be scooped out , and wheeled up in slope along the sides ; high
enough ; for it must be rammed down there , and shaped stair @-@ wise into
as many as &apos; thirty ranges of convenient seats , &apos; firm @-@ trimmed with
turf , covered with enduring timber ; -- and then our huge pyramidal
Fatherland &apos;s @-@ Altar , Autel de la Patrie , in the centre , also to be
raised and stair @-@ stepped ! Force @-@ work with a vengeance ; it is a World &apos;s
Amphitheatre ! There are but fifteen days good ; and at this languid rate ,
it might take half as many weeks . What is singular too , the spademen
seem to work lazily ; they will not work double @-@ tides , even for offer of
more wages , though their tide is but seven hours ; they declare angrily
that the human tabernacle requires occasional rest !

Is it Aristocrats secretly bribing ? Aristocrats were capable of that .
Only six months since , did not evidence get afloat that subterranean
Paris , for we stand over quarries and catacombs , dangerously , as it were
midway between Heaven and the Abyss , and are hollow underground , -- was
charged with gunpowder , which should make us &apos; leap ? &apos; Till a Cordelier &apos;s
Deputation actually went to examine , and found it -- carried off again !
( 23rd December , 1789 ( Newspapers in Hist . Parl. iv . 44 ) . ) An accursed ,
incurable brood ; all asking for &apos; passports , &apos; in these sacred days .
Trouble , of rioting , chateau @-@ burning , is in the Limousin and elsewhere ;
for they are busy ! Between the best of Peoples and the best of
Restorer @-@ Kings , they would sow grudges ; with what a fiend &apos;s @-@ grin would
they see this Federation , looked for by the Universe , fail !

Fail for want of spadework , however , it shall not . He that has four
limbs , and a French heart , can do spadework ; and will ! On the first
July Monday , scarcely has the signal @-@ cannon boomed ; scarcely have the
languescent mercenary Fifteen Thousand laid down their tools , and the
eyes of onlookers turned sorrowfully of the still high Sun ; when this
and the other Patriot , fire in his eye , snatches barrow and mattock ,
and himself begins indignantly wheeling . Whom scores and then hundreds
follow ; and soon a volunteer Fifteen Thousand are shovelling and
trundling ; with the heart of giants ; and all in right order , with that
extemporaneous adroitness of theirs : whereby such a lift has been
given , worth three mercenary ones ; -- which may end when the late twilight
thickens , in triumph shouts , heard or heard of beyond Montmartre !

A sympathetic population will wait , next day , with eagerness , till the
tools are free . Or why wait ? Spades elsewhere exist ! And so now bursts
forth that effulgence of Parisian enthusiasm , good @-@ heartedness and
brotherly love ; such , if Chroniclers are trustworthy , as was not
witnessed since the Age of Gold . Paris , male and female , precipitates
itself towards its South @-@ west extremity , spade on shoulder . Streams of
men , without order ; or in order , as ranked fellow @-@ craftsmen , as natural
or accidental reunions , march towards the Field of Mars . Three @-@ deep
these march ; to the sound of stringed music ; preceded by young girls
with green boughs , and tricolor streamers : they have shouldered ,
soldier @-@ wise , their shovels and picks ; and with one throat are singing
ca @-@ ira . Yes , pardieu ca @-@ ira , cry the passengers on the streets . All
corporate Guilds , and public and private Bodies of Citizens , from the
highest to the lowest , march ; the very Hawkers , one finds , have ceased
bawling for one day . The neighbouring Villages turn out : their able men
come marching , to village fiddle or tambourine and triangle , under their
Mayor , or Mayor and Curate , who also walk bespaded , and in tricolor
sash . As many as one hundred and fifty thousand workers : nay at certain
seasons , as some count , two hundred and fifty thousand ; for , in the
afternoon especially , what mortal but , finishing his hasty day &apos;s work ,
would run ! A stirring city : from the time you reach the Place Louis
Quinze , southward over the River , by all Avenues , it is one living
throng . So many workers ; and no mercenary mock @-@ workers , but real ones
that lie freely to it : each Patriot stretches himself against the
stubborn glebe ; hews and wheels with the whole weight that is in him .

Amiable infants , aimables enfans ! They do the &apos; police des l &apos;atelier&apos;
too , the guidance and governance , themselves ; with that ready will of
theirs , with that extemporaneous adroitness . It is a true brethren &apos;s
work ; all distinctions confounded , abolished ; as it was in the
beginning , when Adam himself delved . Longfrocked tonsured Monks ,
with short @-@ skirted Water @-@ carriers , with swallow @-@ tailed well @-@ frizzled
Incroyables of a Patriot turn ; dark Charcoalmen , meal @-@ white
Peruke @-@ makers ; or Peruke @-@ wearers , for Advocate and Judge are there , and
all Heads of Districts : sober Nuns sisterlike with flaunting Nymphs of
the Opera , and females in common circumstances named unfortunate : the
patriot Rag @-@ picker , and perfumed dweller in palaces ; for Patriotism
like New @-@ birth , and also like Death , levels all . The Printers have
come marching , Prudhomme &apos;s all in Paper @-@ caps with Revolutions de Paris
printed on them ; as Camille notes ; wishing that in these great days
there should be a Pacte des Ecrivains too , or Federation of Able
Editors . ( See Newspapers , &amp; c . ( in Hist . Parl. vi . 381 @-@ 406 ) . ) Beautiful
to see ! The snowy linen and delicate pantaloon alternates with the
soiled check @-@ shirt and bushel @-@ breeches ; for both have cast their coats ,
and under both are four limbs and a set of Patriot muscles . There
do they pick and shovel ; or bend forward , yoked in long strings to
box @-@ barrow or overloaded tumbril ; joyous , with one mind . Abbe Sieyes is
seen pulling , wiry , vehement , if too light for draught ; by the side of
Beauharnais , who shall get Kings though he be none . Abbe Maury did not
pull ; but the Charcoalmen brought a mummer guised like him , so he had
to pull in effigy . Let no august Senator disdain the work : Mayor Bailly ,
Generalissimo Lafayette are there ; -- and , alas , shall be there again
another day ! The King himself comes to see : sky @-@ rending Vive @-@ le @-@ Roi ;
&apos;and suddenly with shouldered spades they form a guard of honour round
him . &apos; Whosoever can come comes , to work , or to look , and bless the work .

Whole families have come . One whole family we see clearly , of three
generations : the father picking , the mother shovelling , the young ones
wheeling assiduous ; old grandfather , hoary with ninety @-@ three years ,
holds in his arms the youngest of all : ( Mercier. ii . 76 , &amp; c . ) frisky ,
not helpful this one ; who nevertheless may tell it to his grandchildren ;
and how the Future and the Past alike looked on , and with failing or
with half @-@ formed voice , faltered their ca @-@ ira . A vintner has wheeled in ,
on Patriot truck , beverage of wine : &quot; Drink not , my brothers , if ye are
not dry ; that your cask may last the longer ; &quot; neither did any drink ,
but men &apos; evidently exhausted . &apos; A dapper Abbe looks on , sneering . &quot; To
the barrow ! &quot; cry several ; whom he , lest a worse thing befal him , obeys :
nevertheless one wiser Patriot barrowman , arriving now , interposes his
&quot; arretez ; &quot; setting down his own barrow , he snatches the Abbe &apos;s ; trundles
it fast , like an infected thing ; forth of the Champ @-@ de @-@ Mars circuit ,
and discharges it there . Thus too a certain person ( of some quality , or
private capital , to appearance ) , entering hastily , flings down his coat ,
waistcoat and two watches , and is rushing to the thick of the work :
&quot; But your watches ? &quot; cries the general voice . -- &quot; Does one distrust his
brothers ? &quot; answers he ; nor were the watches stolen . How beautiful is
noble @-@ sentiment : like gossamer gauze , beautiful and cheap ; which will
stand no tear and wear ! Beautiful cheap gossamer gauze , thou film @-@ shadow
of a raw @-@ material of Virtue , which art not woven , nor likely to be , into
Duty ; thou art better than nothing , and also worse !

Young Boarding @-@ school Boys , College Students , shout Vive la Nation , and
regret that they have yet &apos; only their sweat to give . &apos; What say we
of Boys ? Beautifullest Hebes ; the loveliest of Paris , in their light
air @-@ robes , with riband @-@ girdle of tricolor , are there ; shovelling and
wheeling with the rest ; their Hebe eyes brighter with enthusiasm ,
and long hair in beautiful dishevelment : hard @-@ pressed are their small
fingers ; but they make the patriot barrow go , and even force it to the
summit of the slope ( with a little tracing , which what man &apos;s arm were
not too happy to lend ? ) -- then bound down with it again , and go for more ;
with their long locks and tricolors blown back : graceful as the rosy
Hours . O , as that evening Sun fell over the Champ @-@ de @-@ Mars , and tinted
with fire the thick umbrageous boscage that shelters it on this hand and
on that , and struck direct on those Domes and two @-@ and @-@ forty Windows of
the Ecole Militaire , and made them all of burnished gold , -- saw he on his
wide zodiac road other such sight ? A living garden spotted and dotted
with such flowerage ; all colours of the prism ; the beautifullest blent
friendly with the usefullest ; all growing and working brotherlike there ,
under one warm feeling , were it but for days ; once and no second time !
But Night is sinking ; these Nights too , into Eternity . The hastiest
Traveller Versailles @-@ ward has drawn bridle on the heights of Chaillot :
and looked for moments over the River ; reporting at Versailles what he
saw , not without tears . ( Mercier , ii . 81 . )

Meanwhile , from all points of the compass , Federates are arriving :
fervid children of the South , &apos; who glory in their Mirabeau ; &apos; considerate
North @-@ blooded Mountaineers of Jura ; sharp Bretons , with their Gaelic
suddenness ; Normans not to be overreached in bargain : all now animated
with one noblest fire of Patriotism . Whom the Paris brethren march forth
to receive ; with military solemnities , with fraternal embracing , and
a hospitality worthy of the heroic ages . They assist at the Assembly &apos;s
Debates , these Federates : the Galleries are reserved for them . They
assist in the toils of the Champ @-@ de @-@ Mars ; each new troop will put its
hand to the spade ; lift a hod of earth on the Altar of the Fatherland .
But the flourishes of rhetoric , for it is a gesticulating People ; the
moral @-@ sublime of those Addresses to an august Assembly , to a Patriot
Restorer ! Our Breton Captain of Federates kneels even , in a fit of
enthusiasm , and gives up his sword ; he wet @-@ eyed to a King wet @-@ eyed . Poor
Louis ! These , as he said afterwards , were among the bright days of his
life .

Reviews also there must be ; royal Federate @-@ reviews , with King , Queen and
tricolor Court looking on : at lowest , if , as is too common , it rains ,
our Federate Volunteers will file through the inner gateways , Royalty
standing dry . Nay there , should some stop occur , the beautifullest
fingers in France may take you softly by the lapelle , and , in mild
flute @-@ voice , ask : &quot; Monsieur , of what Province are you ? &quot; Happy he who
can reply , chivalrously lowering his sword &apos;s point , &quot; Madame , from
the Province your ancestors reigned over . &quot; He that happy &apos; Provincial
Advocate , &apos; now Provincial Federate , shall be rewarded by a sun @-@ smile ,
and such melodious glad words addressed to a King : &quot; Sire , these are
your faithful Lorrainers . &quot; Cheerier verily , in these holidays , is this
&apos;skyblue faced with red &apos; of a National Guardsman , than the dull black
and gray of a Provincial Advocate , which in workdays one was used to .
For the same thrice @-@ blessed Lorrainer shall , this evening , stand sentry
at a Queen &apos;s door ; and feel that he could die a thousand deaths for her :
then again , at the outer gate , and even a third time , she shall see him ;
nay he will make her do it ; presenting arms with emphasis , &apos; making
his musket jingle again &apos; : and in her salute there shall again be a
sun @-@ smile , and that little blonde @-@ locked too hasty Dauphin shall be
admonished , &quot; Salute then , Monsieur , don &apos;t be unpolite ; &quot; and therewith
she , like a bright Sky @-@ wanderer or Planet with her little Moon , issues
forth peculiar . ( Narrative by a Lorraine Federate ( given in Hist . Parl .
vi . 389 @-@ 91 ) . )

But at night , when Patriot spadework is over , figure the sacred rights
of hospitality ! Lepelletier Saint @-@ Fargeau , a mere private senator , but
with great possessions , has daily his &apos; hundred dinner @-@ guests ; &apos; the table
of Generalissimo Lafayette may double that number . In lowly parlour ,
as in lofty saloon , the wine @-@ cup passes round ; crowned by the smiles of
Beauty ; be it of lightly @-@ tripping Grisette , or of high @-@ sailing Dame , for
both equally have beauty , and smiles precious to the brave .



Chapter 2.1.XII.

Sound and Smoke .

And so now , in spite of plotting Aristocrats , lazy hired spademen ,
and almost of Destiny itself ( for there has been much rain ) , the
Champ @-@ de @-@ Mars , on the 13th of the month is fairly ready ; trimmed ,
rammed , buttressed with firm masonry ; and Patriotism can stroll over
it admiring ; and as it were rehearsing , for in every head is some
unutterable image of the morrow . Pray Heaven there be not clouds . Nay
what far worse cloud is this , of a misguided Municipality that talks of
admitting Patriotism , to the solemnity , by tickets ! Was it by tickets we
were admitted to the work ; and to what brought the work ? Did we take the
Bastille by tickets ? A misguided Municipality sees the error ; at late
midnight , rolling drums announce to Patriotism starting half out of
its bed @-@ clothes , that it is to be ticketless . Pull down thy night @-@ cap
therefore ; and , with demi @-@ articulate grumble , significant of several
things , go pacified to sleep again . Tomorrow is Wednesday morning ;
unforgetable among the fasti of the world .

The morning comes , cold for a July one ; but such a festivity would make
Greenland smile . Through every inlet of that National Amphitheatre
( for it is a league in circuit , cut with openings at due intervals ) ,
floods @-@ in the living throng ; covers without tumult space after space .
The Ecole Militaire has galleries and overvaulting canopies , where
Carpentry and Painting have vied , for the upper Authorities ; triumphal
arches , at the Gate by the River , bear inscriptions , if weak , yet
well @-@ meant , and orthodox . Far aloft , over the Altar of the Fatherland ,
on their tall crane standards of iron , swing pensile our antique
Cassolettes or pans of incense ; dispensing sweet incense @-@ fumes , -- unless
for the Heathen Mythology , one sees not for whom . Two hundred thousand
Patriotic Men ; and , twice as good , one hundred thousand Patriotic
Women , all decked and glorified as one can fancy , sit waiting in this
Champ @-@ de @-@ Mars .

What a picture : that circle of bright @-@ eyed Life , spread up there , on
its thirty @-@ seated Slope ; leaning , one would say , on the thick umbrage of
those Avenue @-@ Trees , for the stems of them are hidden by the height ; and
all beyond it mere greenness of Summer Earth , with the gleams of waters ,
or white sparklings of stone @-@ edifices : little circular enamel @-@ picture in
the centre of such a vase -- of emerald ! A vase not empty : the Invalides
Cupolas want not their population , nor the distant Windmills of
Montmartre ; on remotest steeple and invisible village belfry , stand
men with spy @-@ glasses . On the heights of Chaillot are many @-@ coloured
undulating groups ; round and far on , over all the circling heights that
embosom Paris , it is as one more or less peopled Amphitheatre ; which the
eye grows dim with measuring . Nay heights , as was before hinted , have
cannon ; and a floating @-@ battery of cannon is on the Seine . When eye
fails , ear shall serve ; and all France properly is but one Amphitheatre :
for in paved town and unpaved hamlet , men walk listening ; till the
muffled thunder sound audible on their horizon , that they too may begin
swearing and firing ! ( Deux Amis , v. 168 . ) But now , to streams of
music , come Federates enough , -- for they have assembled on the Boulevard
Saint @-@ Antoine or thereby , and come marching through the City , with their
Eighty @-@ three Department Banners , and blessings not loud but deep ; comes
National Assembly , and takes seat under its Canopy ; comes Royalty , and
takes seat on a throne beside it . And Lafayette , on white charger , is
here , and all the civic Functionaries ; and the Federates form dances ,
till their strictly military evolutions and manoeuvres can begin .

Evolutions and manoeuvres ? Task not the pen of mortal to describe them :
truant imagination droops ; -- declares that it is not worth while . There
is wheeling and sweeping , to slow , to quick , and double quick @-@ time :
Sieur Motier , or Generalissimo Lafayette , for they are one and the same ,
and he is General of France , in the King &apos;s stead , for four @-@ and @-@ twenty
hours ; Sieur Motier must step forth , with that sublime chivalrous gait
of his ; solemnly ascend the steps of the Fatherland &apos;s Altar , in sight
of Heaven and of the scarcely breathing Earth ; and , under the creak of
those swinging Cassolettes , &apos; pressing his sword &apos;s point firmly there , &apos;
pronounce the Oath , To King , to Law , and Nation ( not to mention &apos; grains&apos;
with their circulating ) , in his own name and that of armed France .
Whereat there is waving of banners and acclaim sufficient . The National
Assembly must swear , standing in its place ; the King himself audibly .
The King swears ; and now be the welkin split with vivats ; let citizens
enfranchised embrace , each smiting heartily his palm into his fellow &apos;s ;
and armed Federates clang their arms ; above all , that floating battery
speak ! It has spoken , -- to the four corners of France . From eminence to
eminence , bursts the thunder ; faint @-@ heard , loud @-@ repeated . What a stone ,
cast into what a lake ; in circles that do not grow fainter . From Arras
to Avignon ; from Metz to Bayonne ! Over Orleans and Blois it rolls , in
cannon @-@ recitative ; Puy bellows of it amid his granite mountains ; Pau
where is the shell @-@ cradle of Great Henri . At far Marseilles , one can
think , the ruddy evening witnesses it ; over the deep @-@ blue Mediterranean
waters , the Castle of If ruddy @-@ tinted darts forth , from every cannon &apos;s
mouth , its tongue of fire ; and all the people shout : Yes , France is
free . O glorious France that has burst out so ; into universal sound and
smoke ; and attained -- the Phrygian Cap of Liberty ! In all Towns , Trees of
Liberty also may be planted ; with or without advantage . Said we not , it
is the highest stretch attained by the Thespian Art on this Planet , or
perhaps attainable ?

The Thespian Art , unfortunately , one must still call it ; for behold
there , on this Field of Mars , the National Banners , before there could
be any swearing , were to be all blessed . A most proper operation ;
since surely without Heaven &apos;s blessing bestowed , say even , audibly or
inaudibly sought , no Earthly banner or contrivance can prove victorious :
but now the means of doing it ? By what thrice @-@ divine Franklin
thunder @-@ rod shall miraculous fire be drawn out of Heaven ; and descend
gently , life @-@ giving , with health to the souls of men ? Alas , by the
simplest : by Two Hundred shaven @-@ crowned Individuals , &apos; in snow @-@ white
albs , with tricolor girdles , &apos; arranged on the steps of Fatherland &apos;s
Altar ; and , at their head for spokesman , Soul &apos;s Overseer
Talleyrand @-@ Perigord ! These shall act as miraculous thunder @-@ rod , -- to such
length as they can . O ye deep azure Heavens , and thou green all @-@ nursing
Earth ; ye Streams ever @-@ flowing ; deciduous Forests that die and are born
again , continually , like the sons of men ; stone Mountains that die daily
with every rain @-@ shower , yet are not dead and levelled for ages of
ages , nor born again ( it seems ) but with new world @-@ explosions , and such
tumultuous seething and tumbling , steam half way to the Moon ; O thou
unfathomable mystic All , garment and dwellingplace of the UNNAMED ; O
spirit , lastly , of Man , who mouldest and modellest that Unfathomable
Unnameable even as we see , -- is not there a miracle : That some French
mortal should , we say not have believed , but pretended to imagine that
he believed that Talleyrand and Two Hundred pieces of white Calico could
do it !

Here , however , we are to remark with the sorrowing Historians of that
day , that suddenly , while Episcopus Talleyrand , long @-@ stoled , with mitre
and tricolor belt , was yet but hitching up the Altar @-@ steps , to do his
miracle , the material Heaven grew black ; a north @-@ wind , moaning cold
moisture , began to sing ; and there descended a very deluge of rain .
Sad to see ! The thirty @-@ staired Seats , all round our Amphitheatre , get
instantaneously slated with mere umbrellas , fallacious when so thick
set : our antique Cassolettes become Water @-@ pots ; their incense @-@ smoke gone
hissing , in a whiff of muddy vapour . Alas , instead of vivats , there is
nothing now but the furious peppering and rattling . From three to four
hundred thousand human individuals feel that they have a skin ; happily
impervious . The General &apos;s sash runs water : how all military banners
droop ; and will not wave , but lazily flap , as if metamorphosed into
painted tin @-@ banners ! Worse , far worse , these hundred thousand , such is
the Historian &apos;s testimony , of the fairest of France ! Their snowy muslins
all splashed and draggled ; the ostrich feather shrunk shamefully to the
backbone of a feather : all caps are ruined ; innermost pasteboard
molten into its original pap : Beauty no longer swims decorated in her
garniture , like Love @-@ goddess hidden @-@ revealed in her Paphian clouds ,
but struggles in disastrous imprisonment in it , for &apos; the shape was
noticeable ; &apos; and now only sympathetic interjections , titterings ,
teeheeings , and resolute good @-@ humour will avail . A deluge ; an incessant
sheet or fluid @-@ column of rain ; -- such that our Overseer &apos;s very mitre
must be filled ; not a mitre , but a filled and leaky fire @-@ bucket on his
reverend head ! -- Regardless of which , Overseer Talleyrand performs his
miracle : the Blessing of Talleyrand , another than that of Jacob , is on
all the Eighty @-@ three departmental flags of France ; which wave or flap ,
with such thankfulness as needs . Towards three o &apos;clock , the sun beams
out again : the remaining evolutions can be transacted under bright
heavens , though with decorations much damaged . ( Deux Amis , v. 143 @-@ 179 . )

On Wednesday our Federation is consummated : but the festivities last out
the week , and over into the next . Festivities such as no Bagdad Caliph ,
or Aladdin with the Lamp , could have equalled . There is a Jousting
on the River ; with its water @-@ somersets , splashing and haha @-@ ing : Abbe
Fauchet , Te @-@ Deum Fauchet , preaches , for his part , in &apos; the rotunda of the
Corn @-@ market , &apos; a Harangue on Franklin ; for whom the National Assembly has
lately gone three days in black . The Motier and Lepelletier tables still
groan with viands ; roofs ringing with patriotic toasts . On the fifth
evening , which is the Christian Sabbath , there is a universal Ball .
Paris , out of doors and in , man , woman and child , is jigging it , to the
sound of harp and four @-@ stringed fiddle . The hoariest @-@ headed man will
tread one other measure , under this nether Moon ; speechless nurselings ,
infants as we call them , ( Greek ) , crow in arms ; and sprawl out
numb @-@ plump little limbs , -- impatient for muscularity , they know not why .
The stiffest balk bends more or less ; all joists creak .

Or out , on the Earth &apos;s breast itself , behold the Ruins of the Bastille .
All lamplit , allegorically decorated : a Tree of Liberty sixty feet high ;
and Phrygian Cap on it , of size enormous , under which King Arthur and
his round @-@ table might have dined ! In the depths of the background , is
a single lugubrious lamp , rendering dim @-@ visible one of your iron cages ,
half @-@ buried , and some Prison stones , -- Tyranny vanishing downwards , all
gone but the skirt : the rest wholly lamp @-@ festoons , trees real or of
pasteboard ; in the similitude of a fairy grove ; with this inscription ,
readable to runner : &apos; Ici l &apos;on danse , Dancing Here . &apos; As indeed had been
obscurely foreshadowed by Cagliostro ( See his Lettre au Peuple Francais ,
London , 1786 . ) prophetic Quack of Quacks , when he , four years ago ,
quitted the grim durance ; -- to fall into a grimmer , of the Roman
Inquisition , and not quit it .

But , after all , what is this Bastille business to that of the Champs
Elysees ! Thither , to these Fields well named Elysian , all feet tend . It
is radiant as day with festooned lamps ; little oil @-@ cups , like variegated
fire @-@ flies , daintily illumine the highest leaves : trees there are all
sheeted with variegated fire , shedding far a glimmer into the dubious
wood . There , under the free sky , do tight @-@ limbed Federates , with fairest
newfound sweethearts , elastic as Diana , and not of that coyness and tart
humour of Diana , thread their jocund mazes , all through the ambrosial
night ; and hearts were touched and fired ; and seldom surely had our old
Planet , in that huge conic Shadow of hers &apos; which goes beyond the Moon ,
and is named Night , &apos; curtained such a Ball @-@ room . O if , according to
Seneca , the very gods look down on a good man struggling with adversity ,
and smile ; what must they think of Five @-@ and @-@ twenty million indifferent
ones victorious over it , -- for eight days and more ?

In this way , and in such ways , however , has the Feast of Pikes danced
itself off ; gallant Federates wending homewards , towards every point of
the compass , with feverish nerves , heart and head much heated ; some
of them , indeed , as Dampmartin &apos;s elderly respectable friend , from
Strasbourg , quite &apos; burnt out with liquors , &apos; and flickering towards
extinction . ( Dampmartin , Evenemens , i . 144 @-@ 184 . ) The Feast of Pikes
has danced itself off , and become defunct , and the ghost of a
Feast ; -- nothing of it now remaining but this vision in men &apos;s memory ; and
the place that knew it ( for the slope of that Champ @-@ de @-@ Mars is crumbled
to half the original height ( Dulaure , Histoire de Paris , viii . 25 ) . )
now knowing it no more . Undoubtedly one of the memorablest National
Hightides . Never or hardly ever , as we said , was Oath sworn with such
heart @-@ effusion , emphasis and expenditure of joyance ; and then it was
broken irremediably within year and day . Ah , why ? When the swearing of
it was so heavenly @-@ joyful , bosom clasped to bosom , and Five @-@ and @-@ twenty
million hearts all burning together : O ye inexorable Destinies ,
why ? -- Partly because it was sworn with such over @-@ joyance ; but chiefly ,
indeed , for an older reason : that Sin had come into the world and Misery
by Sin ! These Five @-@ and @-@ twenty millions , if we will consider it , have
now henceforth , with that Phrygian Cap of theirs , no force over them , to
bind and guide ; neither in them , more than heretofore , is guiding force ,
or rule of just living : how then , while they all go rushing at such a
pace , on unknown ways , with no bridle , towards no aim , can hurlyburly
unutterable fail ? For verily not Federation @-@ rosepink is the colour of
this Earth and her work : not by outbursts of noble @-@ sentiment , but with
far other ammunition , shall a man front the world .

But how wise , in all cases , to &apos; husband your fire ; &apos; to keep it deep
down , rather , as genial radical @-@ heat ! Explosions , the forciblest , and
never so well directed , are questionable ; far oftenest futile , always
frightfully wasteful : but think of a man , of a Nation of men , spending
its whole stock of fire in one artificial Firework ! So have we seen
fond weddings ( for individuals , like Nations , have their Hightides )
celebrated with an outburst of triumph and deray , at which the elderly
shook their heads . Better had a serious cheerfulness been ; for the
enterprise was great . Fond pair ! the more triumphant ye feel , and
victorious over terrestrial evil , which seems all abolished , the
wider @-@ eyed will your disappointment be to find terrestrial evil still
extant . &quot; And why extant ? &quot; will each of you cry : &quot; Because my false mate
has played the traitor : evil was abolished ; I meant faithfully , and did ,
or would have done . &quot; Whereby the oversweet moon of honey changes itself
into long years of vinegar ; perhaps divulsive vinegar , like Hannibal &apos;s .

Shall we say then , the French Nation has led Royalty , or wooed and
teased poor Royalty to lead her , to the hymeneal Fatherland &apos;s Altar ,
in such oversweet manner ; and has , most thoughtlessly , to celebrate the
nuptials with due shine and demonstration , -- burnt her bed ?

Chapter 2.2.I.

Bouille .

Dimly visible , at Metz on the North @-@ Eastern frontier , a certain brave
Bouille , last refuge of Royalty in all straits and meditations of
flight , has for many months hovered occasionally in our eye ; some name
or shadow of a brave Bouille : let us now , for a little , look fixedly at
him , till he become a substance and person for us . The man himself is
worth a glance ; his position and procedure there , in these days , will
throw light on many things .

For it is with Bouille as with all French Commanding Officers ; only in
a more emphatic degree . The grand National Federation , we already guess ,
was but empty sound , or worse : a last loudest universal
Hep @-@ hep @-@ hurrah , with full bumpers , in that National Lapithae @-@ feast of
Constitution @-@ making ; as in loud denial of the palpably existing ; as if ,
with hurrahings , you would shut out notice of the inevitable already
knocking at the gates ! Which new National bumper , one may say , can but
deepen the drunkenness ; and so , the louder it swears Brotherhood , will
the sooner and the more surely lead to Cannibalism . Ah , under that
fraternal shine and clangour , what a deep world of irreconcileable
discords lie momentarily assuaged , damped down for one moment !
Respectable military Federates have barely got home to their quarters ;
and the inflammablest , &apos; dying , burnt up with liquors , and kindness , &apos; has
not yet got extinct ; the shine is hardly out of men &apos;s eyes , and still
blazes filling all men &apos;s memories , -- when your discords burst forth again
very considerably darker than ever . Let us look at Bouille , and see how .

Bouille for the present commands in the Garrison of Metz , and far and
wide over the East and North ; being indeed , by a late act of Government
with sanction of National Assembly , appointed one of our Four supreme
Generals . Rochambeau and Mailly , men and Marshals of note in these
days , though to us of small moment , are two of his colleagues ; tough
old babbling Luckner , also of small moment for us , will probably be
the third . Marquis de Bouille is a determined Loyalist ; not indeed
disinclined to moderate reform , but resolute against immoderate . A man
long suspect to Patriotism ; who has more than once given the august
Assembly trouble ; who would not , for example , take the National Oath , as
he was bound to do , but always put it off on this or the other pretext ,
till an autograph of Majesty requested him to do it as a favour . There ,
in this post if not of honour , yet of eminence and danger , he waits , in
a silent concentered manner ; very dubious of the future . &apos; Alone , &apos; as he
says , or almost alone , of all the old military Notabilities , he has not
emigrated ; but thinks always , in atrabiliar moments , that there will be
nothing for him too but to cross the marches . He might cross , say , to
Treves or Coblentz where Exiled Princes will be one day ranking ; or
say , over into Luxemburg where old Broglie loiters and languishes . Or is
there not the great dim Deep of European Diplomacy ; where your Calonnes ,
your Breteuils are beginning to hover , dimly discernible ?

With immeasurable confused outlooks and purposes , with no clear purpose
but this of still trying to do His Majesty a service , Bouille waits ;
struggling what he can to keep his district loyal , his troops faithful ,
his garrisons furnished . He maintains , as yet , with his Cousin
Lafayette , some thin diplomatic correspondence , by letter and messenger ;
chivalrous constitutional professions on the one side , military gravity
and brevity on the other ; which thin correspondence one can see growing
ever the thinner and hollower , towards the verge of entire vacuity .
( Bouille , Memoires ( London , 1797 ) , i. c . 8 . ) A quick , choleric , sharply
discerning , stubbornly endeavouring man ; with suppressed @-@ explosive
resolution , with valour , nay headlong audacity : a man who was more in
his place , lionlike defending those Windward Isles , or , as with military
tiger @-@ spring , clutching Nevis and Montserrat from the English , -- than
here in this suppressed condition , muzzled and fettered by diplomatic
packthreads ; looking out for a civil war , which may never arrive . Few
years ago Bouille was to have led a French East @-@ Indian Expedition , and
reconquered or conquered Pondicherri and the Kingdoms of the Sun : but
the whole world is suddenly changed , and he with it ; Destiny willed it
not in that way but in this .



Chapter 2.2.II.

Arrears and Aristocrats .

Indeed , as to the general outlook of things , Bouille himself augurs not
well of it . The French Army , ever since those old Bastille days , and
earlier , has been universally in the questionablest state , and growing
daily worse . Discipline , which is at all times a kind of miracle , and
works by faith , broke down then ; one sees not with that near prospect of
recovering itself . The Gardes Francaises played a deadly game ; but how
they won it , and wear the prizes of it , all men know . In that general
overturn , we saw the Hired Fighters refuse to fight . The very Swiss of
Chateau @-@ Vieux , which indeed is a kind of French Swiss , from Geneva and
the Pays de Vaud , are understood to have declined . Deserters glided
over ; Royal @-@ Allemand itself looked disconsolate , though stanch of
purpose . In a word , we there saw Military Rule , in the shape of poor
Besenval with that convulsive unmanageable Camp of his , pass two martyr
days on the Champ @-@ de @-@ Mars ; and then , veiling itself , so to speak , &apos; under
the cloud of night , &apos; depart &apos; down the left bank of the Seine , &apos; to seek
refuge elsewhere ; this ground having clearly become too hot for it .

But what new ground to seek , what remedy to try ? Quarters that were
&apos;uninfected : &apos; this doubtless , with judicious strictness of drilling ,
were the plan . Alas , in all quarters and places , from Paris onward to
the remotest hamlet , is infection , is seditious contagion : inhaled ,
propagated by contact and converse , till the dullest soldier catch
it ! There is speech of men in uniform with men not in uniform ; men in
uniform read journals , and even write in them . ( See Newspapers of
July , 1789 ( in Hist . Parl. ii . 35 ) , &amp; c . ) There are public petitions or
remonstrances , private emissaries and associations ; there is discontent ,
jealousy , uncertainty , sullen suspicious humour . The whole French Army ,
fermenting in dark heat , glooms ominous , boding good to no one .

So that , in the general social dissolution and revolt , we are to have
this deepest and dismallest kind of it , a revolting soldiery ? Barren ,
desolate to look upon is this same business of revolt under all its
aspects ; but how infinitely more so , when it takes the aspect of
military mutiny ! The very implement of rule and restraint , whereby
all the rest was managed and held in order , has become precisely the
frightfullest immeasurable implement of misrule ; like the element
of Fire , our indispensable all @-@ ministering servant , when it gets the
mastery , and becomes conflagration . Discipline we called a kind of
miracle : in fact , is it not miraculous how one man moves hundreds of
thousands ; each unit of whom it may be loves him not , and singly fears
him not , yet has to obey him , to go hither or go thither , to march and
halt , to give death , and even to receive it , as if a Fate had spoken ;
and the word @-@ of @-@ command becomes , almost in the literal sense , a
magic @-@ word ?

Which magic @-@ word , again , if it be once forgotten ; the spell of it once
broken ! The legions of assiduous ministering spirits rise on you now as
menacing fiends ; your free orderly arena becomes a tumult @-@ place of the
Nether Pit , and the hapless magician is rent limb from limb . Military
mobs are mobs with muskets in their hands ; and also with death hanging
over their heads , for death is the penalty of disobedience and they
have disobeyed . And now if all mobs are properly frenzies , and work
frenetically with mad fits of hot and of cold , fierce rage alternating
so incoherently with panic terror , consider what your military mob
will be , with such a conflict of duties and penalties , whirled between
remorse and fury , and , for the hot fit , loaded fire @-@ arms in its hand ! To
the soldier himself , revolt is frightful , and oftenest perhaps pitiable ;
and yet so dangerous , it can only be hated , cannot be pitied . An
anomalous class of mortals these poor Hired Killers ! With a frankness ,
which to the Moralist in these times seems surprising , they have sworn
to become machines ; and nevertheless they are still partly men . Let no
prudent person in authority remind them of this latter fact ; but always
let force , let injustice above all , stop short clearly on this side of
the rebounding @-@ point ! Soldiers , as we often say , do revolt : were it not
so , several things which are transient in this world might be perennial .

Over and above the general quarrel which all sons of Adam maintain
with their lot here below , the grievances of the French soldiery reduce
themselves to two , First that their Officers are Aristocrats ; secondly
that they cheat them of their Pay . Two grievances ; or rather we might
say one , capable of becoming a hundred ; for in that single first
proposition , that the Officers are Aristocrats , what a multitude of
corollaries lie ready ! It is a bottomless ever @-@ flowing fountain of
grievances this ; what you may call a general raw @-@ material of grievance ,
wherefrom individual grievance after grievance will daily body itself
forth . Nay there will even be a kind of comfort in getting it , from
time to time , so embodied . Peculation of one &apos;s Pay ! It is embodied ; made
tangible , made denounceable ; exhalable , if only in angry words .

For unluckily that grand fountain of grievances does exist : Aristocrats
almost all our Officers necessarily are ; they have it in the blood and
bone . By the law of the case , no man can pretend to be the pitifullest
lieutenant of militia , till he have first verified , to the satisfaction
of the Lion @-@ King , a Nobility of four generations . Not Nobility only ,
but four generations of it : this latter is the improvement hit upon ,
in comparatively late years , by a certain War @-@ minister much pressed for
commissions . ( Dampmartin , Evenemens , i . 89 . ) An improvement which did
relieve the over @-@ pressed War @-@ minister , but which split France still
further into yawning contrasts of Commonalty and Nobility , nay of new
Nobility and old ; as if already with your new and old , and then with
your old , older and oldest , there were not contrasts and discrepancies
enough ; -- the general clash whereof men now see and hear , and in the
singular whirlpool , all contrasts gone together to the bottom ! Gone to
the bottom or going ; with uproar , without return ; going every where save
in the Military section of things ; and there , it may be asked , can they
hope to continue always at the top ? Apparently , not .

It is true , in a time of external Peace , when there is no fighting but
only drilling , this question , How you rise from the ranks , may seem
theoretical rather . But in reference to the Rights of Man it is
continually practical . The soldier has sworn to be faithful not to the
King only , but to the Law and the Nation . Do our commanders love the
Revolution ? ask all soldiers . Unhappily no , they hate it , and love the
Counter @-@ Revolution . Young epauletted men , with quality @-@ blood in
them , poisoned with quality @-@ pride , do sniff openly , with indignation
struggling to become contempt , at our Rights of Man , as at some
newfangled cobweb , which shall be brushed down again . Old officers , more
cautious , keep silent , with closed uncurled lips ; but one guesses what
is passing within . Nay who knows , how , under the plausiblest word of
command , might lie Counter @-@ Revolution itself , sale to Exiled Princes
and the Austrian Kaiser : treacherous Aristocrats hoodwinking the
small insight of us common men ? -- In such manner works that general
raw @-@ material of grievance ; disastrous ; instead of trust and reverence ,
breeding hate , endless suspicion , the impossibility of commanding
and obeying . And now when this second more tangible grievance has
articulated itself universally in the mind of the common man : Peculation
of his Pay ! Peculation of the despicablest sort does exist , and has
long existed ; but , unless the new @-@ declared Rights of Man , and all rights
whatsoever , be a cobweb , it shall no longer exist .

The French Military System seems dying a sorrowful suicidal death . Nay
more , citizen , as is natural , ranks himself against citizen in this
cause . The soldier finds audience , of numbers and sympathy unlimited ,
among the Patriot lower @-@ classes . Nor are the higher wanting to the
officer . The officer still dresses and perfumes himself for such sad
unemigrated soiree as there may still be ; and speaks his woes , -- which
woes , are they not Majesty &apos;s and Nature &apos;s ? Speaks , at the same time ,
his gay defiance , his firm @-@ set resolution . Citizens , still more
Citizenesses , see the right and the wrong ; not the Military System alone
will die by suicide , but much along with it . As was said , there is yet
possible a deepest overturn than any yet witnessed : that deepest upturn
of the black @-@ burning sulphurous stratum whereon all rests and grows !

But how these things may act on the rude soldier @-@ mind , with its military
pedantries , its inexperience of all that lies off the parade @-@ ground ;
inexperience as of a child , yet fierceness of a man and vehemence of
a Frenchman ! It is long that secret communings in mess @-@ room and
guard @-@ room , sour looks , thousandfold petty vexations between commander
and commanded , measure every where the weary military day . Ask Captain
Dampmartin ; an authentic , ingenious literary officer of horse ; who loves
the Reign of Liberty , after a sort ; yet has had his heart grieved to the
quick many times , in the hot South @-@ Western region and elsewhere ; and
has seen riot , civil battle by daylight and by torchlight , and anarchy
hatefuller than death . How insubordinate Troopers , with drink in their
heads , meet Captain Dampmartin and another on the ramparts , where there
is no escape or side @-@ path ; and make military salute punctually , for we
look calm on them ; yet make it in a snappish , almost insulting manner :
how one morning they &apos; leave all their chamois shirts &apos; and superfluous
buffs , which they are tired of , laid in piles at the Captain &apos;s doors ;
whereat &apos; we laugh , &apos; as the ass does , eating thistles : nay how they &apos; knot
two forage @-@ cords together , &apos; with universal noisy cursing , with evident
intent to hang the Quarter @-@ master : -- all this the worthy Captain ,
looking on it through the ruddy @-@ and @-@ sable of fond regretful memory , has
flowingly written down . ( Dampmartin , Evenemens , i . 122 @-@ 146 . ) Men growl
in vague discontent ; officers fling up their commissions , and emigrate
in disgust .

Or let us ask another literary Officer ; not yet Captain ; Sublieutenant
only , in the Artillery Regiment La Fere : a young man of twenty @-@ one ; not
unentitled to speak ; the name of him is Napoleon Buonaparte . To such
height of Sublieutenancy has he now got promoted , from Brienne School ,
five years ago ; &apos; being found qualified in mathematics by La Place . &apos; 
He is lying at Auxonne , in the West , in these months ; not sumptuously
lodged -- &apos; in the house of a Barber , to whose wife he did not pay the
customary degree of respect ; &apos; or even over at the Pavilion , in a
chamber with bare walls ; the only furniture an indifferent &apos; bed without
curtains , two chairs , and in the recess of a window a table covered with
books and papers : his Brother Louis sleeps on a coarse mattrass in an
adjoining room . &apos; However , he is doing something great : writing his first
Book or Pamphlet , -- eloquent vehement Letter to M. Matteo Buttafuoco ,
our Corsican Deputy , who is not a Patriot but an Aristocrat , unworthy
of Deputyship . Joly of Dole is Publisher . The literary Sublieutenant
corrects the proofs ; &apos; sets out on foot from Auxonne , every morning at
four o &apos;clock , for Dole : after looking over the proofs , he partakes of
an extremely frugal breakfast with Joly , and immediately prepares for
returning to his Garrison ; where he arrives before noon , having thus
walked above twenty miles in the course of the morning . &apos; 

This Sublieutenant can remark that , in drawing @-@ rooms , on streets , on
highways , at inns , every where men &apos;s minds are ready to kindle into a
flame . That a Patriot , if he appear in the drawing @-@ room , or amid a
group of officers , is liable enough to be discouraged , so great is the
majority against him : but no sooner does he get into the street , or
among the soldiers , than he feels again as if the whole Nation were with
him . That after the famous Oath , To the King , to the Nation and Law ,
there was a great change ; that before this , if ordered to fire on the
people , he for one would have done it in the King &apos;s name ; but that after
this , in the Nation &apos;s name , he would not have done it . Likewise that the
Patriot officers , more numerous too in the Artillery and Engineers than
elsewhere , were few in number ; yet that having the soldiers on their
side , they ruled the regiment ; and did often deliver the Aristocrat
brother officer out of peril and strait . One day , for example , &apos; a member
of our own mess roused the mob , by singing , from the windows of our
dining @-@ room , O Richard , O my King ; and I had to snatch him from their
fury . &apos; ( Norvins , Histoire de Napoleon , i . 47 ; Las Cases , Memoires
translated into Hazlitt &apos;s Life of Napoleon , i . 23 @-@ 31 . )

All which let the reader multiply by ten thousand ; and spread it with
slight variations over all the camps and garrisons of France . The French
Army seems on the verge of universal mutiny .

Universal mutiny ! There is in that what may well make Patriot
Constitutionalism and an august Assembly shudder . Something behoves to
be done ; yet what to do no man can tell . Mirabeau proposes even that the
Soldiery , having come to such a pass , be forthwith disbanded , the whole
Two Hundred and Eighty Thousands of them ; and organised anew . ( Moniteur ,
1790 . No. 233 . ) Impossible this , in so sudden a manner ! cry all men . And
yet literally , answer we , it is inevitable , in one manner or another .
Such an Army , with its four @-@ generation Nobles , its Peculated Pay , and
men knotting forage cords to hang their quartermaster , cannot subsist
beside such a Revolution . Your alternative is a slow @-@ pining chronic
dissolution and new organization ; or a swift decisive one ; the agonies
spread over years , or concentrated into an hour . With a Mirabeau for
Minister or Governor the latter had been the choice ; with no Mirabeau
for Governor it will naturally be the former .

Bouille at Metz .

To Bouille , in his North @-@ Eastern circle , none of these things are
altogether hid . Many times flight over the marches gleams out on him as
a last guidance in such bewilderment : nevertheless he continues here :
struggling always to hope the best , not from new organisation but from
happy Counter @-@ Revolution and return to the old . For the rest it is clear
to him that this same National Federation , and universal swearing and
fraternising of People and Soldiers , has done &apos; incalculable mischief . &apos; 
So much that fermented secretly has hereby got vent and become open :
National Guards and Soldiers of the line , solemnly embracing one another
on all parade @-@ fields , drinking , swearing patriotic oaths , fall into
disorderly street @-@ processions , constitutional unmilitary exclamations
and hurrahings . On which account the Regiment Picardie , for one , has to
be drawn out in the square of the barracks , here at Metz , and sharply
harangued by the General himself ; but expresses penitence . ( Bouille ,
Memoires , i . 113 . )

Far and near , as accounts testify , insubordination has begun grumbling
louder and louder . Officers have been seen shut up in their mess @-@ rooms ;
assaulted with clamorous demands , not without menaces . The insubordinate
ringleader is dismissed with &apos; yellow furlough , &apos; yellow infamous thing
they call cartouche jaune : but ten new ringleaders rise in his stead ,
and the yellow cartouche ceases to be thought disgraceful . &apos; Within a
fortnight , &apos; or at furthest a month , of that sublime Feast of Pikes , the
whole French Army , demanding Arrears , forming Reading Clubs , frequenting
Popular Societies , is in a state which Bouille can call by no name
but that of mutiny . Bouille knows it as few do ; and speaks by dire
experience . Take one instance instead of many .

It is still an early day of August , the precise date now undiscoverable ,
when Bouille , about to set out for the waters of Aix la Chapelle , is
once more suddenly summoned to the barracks of Metz . The soldiers stand
ranked in fighting order , muskets loaded , the officers all there on
compulsion ; and require , with many @-@ voiced emphasis , to have their
arrears paid . Picardie was penitent ; but we see it has relapsed : the
wide space bristles and lours with mere mutinous armed men . Brave
Bouille advances to the nearest Regiment , opens his commanding lips to
harangue ; obtains nothing but querulous @-@ indignant discordance , and the
sound of so many thousand livres legally due . The moment is trying ;
there are some ten thousand soldiers now in Metz , and one spirit seems
to have spread among them .

Bouille is firm as the adamant ; but what shall he do ? A German Regiment ,
named of Salm , is thought to be of better temper : nevertheless Salm too
may have heard of the precept , Thou shalt not steal ; Salm too may know
that money is money . Bouille walks trustfully towards the Regiment de
Salm , speaks trustful words ; but here again is answered by the cry
of forty @-@ four thousand livres odd sous . A cry waxing more and more
vociferous , as Salm &apos;s humour mounts ; which cry , as it will produce
no cash or promise of cash , ends in the wide simultaneous whirr of
shouldered muskets , and a determined quick @-@ time march on the part of
Salm -- towards its Colonel &apos;s house , in the next street , there to seize
the colours and military chest . Thus does Salm , for its part ; strong in
the faith that meum is not tuum , that fair speeches are not forty @-@ four
thousand livres odd sous .

Unrestrainable ! Salm tramps to military time , quick consuming the way .
Bouille and the officers , drawing sword , have to dash into double quick
pas @-@ de @-@ charge , or unmilitary running ; to get the start ; to station
themselves on the outer staircase , and stand there with what of
death @-@ defiance and sharp steel they have ; Salm truculently coiling
itself up , rank after rank , opposite them , in such humour as we can
fancy , which happily has not yet mounted to the murder @-@ pitch . There will
Bouille stand , certain at least of one man &apos;s purpose ; in grim calmness ,
awaiting the issue . What the intrepidest of men and generals can do is
done . Bouille , though there is a barricading picket at each end of
the street , and death under his eyes , contrives to send for a Dragoon
Regiment with orders to charge : the dragoon officers mount ; the dragoon
men will not : hope is none there for him . The street , as we say ,
barricaded ; the Earth all shut out , only the indifferent heavenly Vault
overhead : perhaps here or there a timorous householder peering out of
window , with prayer for Bouille ; copious Rascality , on the pavement ,
with prayer for Salm : there do the two parties stand ; -- like chariots
locked in a narrow thoroughfare ; like locked wrestlers at a dead @-@ grip !
For two hours they stand ; Bouille &apos;s sword glittering in his hand ,
adamantine resolution clouding his brows : for two hours by the clocks of
Metz . Moody @-@ silent stands Salm , with occasional clangour ; but does not
fire . Rascality from time to time urges some grenadier to level his
musket at the General ; who looks on it as a bronze General would ; and
always some corporal or other strikes it up .

In such remarkable attitude , standing on that staircase for two hours ,
does brave Bouille , long a shadow , dawn on us visibly out of the
dimness , and become a person . For the rest , since Salm has not shot him
at the first instant , and since in himself there is no variableness , the
danger will diminish . The Mayor , &apos; a man infinitely respectable , &apos;
with his Municipals and tricolor sashes , finally gains entrance ;
remonstrates , perorates , promises ; gets Salm persuaded home to its
barracks . Next day , our respectable Mayor lending the money , the
officers pay down the half of the demand in ready cash . With which
liquidation Salm pacifies itself , and for the present all is hushed up ,
as much as may be . ( Bouille , i . 140 @-@ 5 . )

Such scenes as this of Metz , or preparations and demonstrations
towards such , are universal over France : Dampmartin , with his knotted
forage @-@ cords and piled chamois jackets , is at Strasburg in the
South @-@ East ; in these same days or rather nights , Royal Champagne is
&apos;shouting Vive la Nation , au diable les Aristocrates , with some thirty
lit candles , &apos; at Hesdin , on the far North @-@ West . &quot; The garrison of
Bitche , &quot; Deputy Rewbell is sorry to state , &quot; went out of the town , with
drums beating ; deposed its officers ; and then returned into the town ,
sabre in hand . &quot; ( Moniteur ( in Hist . Parl. vii . 29 ) . ) Ought not a
National Assembly to occupy itself with these objects ? Military France
is everywhere full of sour inflammatory humour , which exhales itself
fuliginously , this way or that : a whole continent of smoking flax ;
which , blown on here or there by any angry wind , might so easily start
into a blaze , into a continent of fire !

Constitutional Patriotism is in deep natural alarm at these things . The
august Assembly sits diligently deliberating ; dare nowise resolve , with
Mirabeau , on an instantaneous disbandment and extinction ; finds that a
course of palliatives is easier . But at least and lowest , this grievance
of the Arrears shall be rectified . A plan , much noised of in those days ,
under the name &apos; Decree of the Sixth of August , &apos; has been devised for
that . Inspectors shall visit all armies ; and , with certain elected
corporals and &apos; soldiers able to write , &apos; verify what arrears and
peculations do lie due , and make them good . Well , if in this way
the smoky heat be cooled down ; if it be not , as we say , ventilated
over @-@ much , or , by sparks and collision somewhere , sent up !



Chapter 2.2.IV.

Arrears at Nanci .

We are to remark , however , that of all districts , this of Bouille &apos;s
seems the inflammablest . It was always to Bouille and Metz that
Royalty would fly : Austria lies near ; here more than elsewhere must
the disunited People look over the borders , into a dim sea of Foreign
Politics and Diplomacies , with hope or apprehension , with mutual
exasperation .

It was but in these days that certain Austrian troops , marching
peaceably across an angle of this region , seemed an Invasion realised ;
and there rushed towards Stenai , with musket on shoulder , from all the
winds , some thirty thousand National Guards , to inquire what the matter
was . ( Moniteur , Seance du 9 Aout 1790 . ) A matter of mere diplomacy it
proved ; the Austrian Kaiser , in haste to get to Belgium , had bargained
for this short cut . The infinite dim movement of European Politics waved
a skirt over these spaces , passing on its way ; like the passing shadow
of a condor ; and such a winged flight of thirty thousand , with mixed
cackling and crowing , rose in consequence ! For , in addition to all , this
people , as we said , is much divided : Aristocrats abound ; Patriotism has
both Aristocrats and Austrians to watch . It is Lorraine , this region ;
not so illuminated as old France : it remembers ancient Feudalisms ; nay ,
within man &apos;s memory , it had a Court and King of its own , or indeed the
splendour of a Court and King , without the burden . Then , contrariwise ,
the Mother Society , which sits in the Jacobins Church at Paris , has
Daughters in the Towns here ; shrill @-@ tongued , driven acrid : consider how
the memory of good King Stanislaus , and ages of Imperial Feudalism , may
comport with this New acrid Evangel , and what a virulence of discord
there may be ! In all which , the Soldiery , officers on one side , private
men on the other , takes part , and now indeed principal part ; a Soldiery ,
moreover , all the hotter here as it lies the denser , the frontier
Province requiring more of it .

So stands Lorraine : but the capital City , more especially so . The
pleasant City of Nanci , which faded Feudalism loves , where King
Stanislaus personally dwelt and shone , has an Aristocrat Municipality ,
and then also a Daughter Society : it has some forty thousand divided
souls of population ; and three large Regiments , one of which is Swiss
Chateau @-@ Vieux , dear to Patriotism ever since it refused fighting , or
was thought to refuse , in the Bastille days . Here unhappily all evil
influences seem to meet concentered ; here , of all places , may jealousy
and heat evolve itself . These many months , accordingly , man has been set
against man , Washed against Unwashed ; Patriot Soldier against Aristocrat
Captain , ever the more bitterly ; and a long score of grudges has been
running up .

Nameable grudges , and likewise unnameable : for there is a punctual
nature in Wrath ; and daily , were there but glances of the eye , tones
of the voice , and minutest commissions or omissions , it will jot down
somewhat , to account , under the head of sundries , which always swells
the sum @-@ total . For example , in April last , in those times of preliminary
Federation , when National Guards and Soldiers were every where swearing
brotherhood , and all France was locally federating , preparing for the
grand National Feast of Pikes , it was observed that these Nanci Officers
threw cold water on the whole brotherly business ; that they first hung
back from appearing at the Nanci Federation ; then did appear , but in
mere redingote and undress , with scarcely a clean shirt on ; nay that one
of them , as the National Colours flaunted by in that solemn moment , did ,
without visible necessity , take occasion to spit . ( Deux Amis , v. 217 . )

Small &apos; sundries as per journal , &apos; but then incessant ones ! The Aristocrat
Municipality , pretending to be Constitutional , keeps mostly quiet ; not
so the Daughter Society , the five thousand adult male Patriots of the
place , still less the five thousand female : not so the young , whiskered
or whiskerless , four @-@ generation Noblesse in epaulettes ; the grim Patriot
Swiss of Chateau @-@ Vieux , effervescent infantry of Regiment du Roi , hot
troopers of Mestre @-@ de @-@ Camp ! Walled Nanci , which stands so bright and
trim , with its straight streets , spacious squares , and Stanislaus&apos;
Architecture , on the fruitful alluvium of the Meurthe ; so bright , amid
the yellow cornfields in these Reaper @-@ Months , -- is inwardly but a den of
discord , anxiety , inflammability , not far from exploding . Let Bouille
look to it . If that universal military heat , which we liken to a vast
continent of smoking flax , do any where take fire , his beard , here in
Lorraine and Nanci , may the most readily of all get singed by it .

Bouille , for his part , is busy enough , but only with the general
superintendence ; getting his pacified Salm , and all other still
tolerable Regiments , marched out of Metz , to southward towns and
villages ; to rural Cantonments as at Vic , Marsal and thereabout , by
the still waters ; where is plenty of horse @-@ forage , sequestered
parade @-@ ground , and the soldier &apos;s speculative faculty can be stilled
by drilling . Salm , as we said , received only half payment of arrears ;
naturally not without grumbling . Nevertheless that scene of the drawn
sword may , after all , have raised Bouille in the mind of Salm ; for men
and soldiers love intrepidity and swift inflexible decision , even when
they suffer by it . As indeed is not this fundamentally the quality of
qualities for a man ? A quality which by itself is next to nothing ,
since inferior animals , asses , dogs , even mules have it ; yet , in due
combination , it is the indispensable basis of all .

Of Nanci and its heats , Bouille , commander of the whole , knows nothing
special ; understands generally that the troops in that City are perhaps
the worst . ( Bouille , i. c . 9 . ) The Officers there have it all , as they
have long had it , to themselves ; and unhappily seem to manage it ill .
&apos;Fifty yellow furloughs , &apos; given out in one batch , do surely betoken
difficulties . But what was Patriotism to think of certain light @-@ fencing
Fusileers &apos; set on , &apos; or supposed to be set on , &apos; to insult the
Grenadier @-@ club , &apos; considerate speculative Grenadiers , and that
reading @-@ room of theirs ? With shoutings , with hootings ; till the
speculative Grenadier drew his side @-@ arms too ; and there ensued battery
and duels ! Nay more , are not swashbucklers of the same stamp &apos; sent out&apos;
visibly , or sent out presumably , now in the dress of Soldiers to pick
quarrels with the Citizens ; now , disguised as Citizens , to pick quarrels
with the Soldiers ? For a certain Roussiere , expert in fence , was taken
in the very fact ; four Officers ( presumably of tender years ) hounding
him on , who thereupon fled precipitately ! Fence @-@ master Roussiere , haled
to the guardhouse , had sentence of three months &apos; imprisonment : but
his comrades demanded &apos; yellow furlough &apos; for him of all persons ; nay ,
thereafter they produced him on parade ; capped him in paper @-@ helmet
inscribed , Iscariot ; marched him to the gate of City ; and there sternly
commanded him to vanish for evermore .

On all which suspicions , accusations and noisy procedure , and on enough
of the like continually accumulating , the Officer could not but look
with disdainful indignation ; perhaps disdainfully express the same in
words , and &apos; soon after fly over to the Austrians . &apos; 

So that when it here as elsewhere comes to the question of Arrears ,
the humour and procedure is of the bitterest : Regiment Mestre @-@ de @-@ Camp
getting , amid loud clamour , some three gold louis a @-@ man , -- which have ,
as usual , to be borrowed from the Municipality ; Swiss Chateau @-@ Vieux
applying for the like , but getting instead instantaneous courrois , or
cat @-@ o &apos; -nine @-@ tails , with subsequent unsufferable hisses from the women
and children ; Regiment du Roi , sick of hope deferred , at length seizing
its military chest , and marching it to quarters , but next day marching
it back again , through streets all struck silent : -- unordered paradings
and clamours , not without strong liquor ; objurgation , insubordination ;
your military ranked Arrangement going all ( as the Typographers say of
set types , in a similar case ) rapidly to pie ! ( Deux Amis , v. c . 8 . ) Such
is Nanci in these early days of August ; the sublime Feast of Pikes not
yet a month old .

Constitutional Patriotism , at Paris and elsewhere , may well quake at
the news . War @-@ Minister Latour du Pin runs breathless to the National
Assembly , with a written message that &apos; all is burning , tout brule , tout
presse . &apos; The National Assembly , on spur of the instant , renders such
Decret , and &apos; order to submit and repent , &apos; as he requires ; if it will
avail any thing . On the other hand , Journalism , through all its throats ,
gives hoarse outcry , condemnatory , elegiac @-@ applausive . The Forty @-@ eight
Sections , lift up voices ; sonorous Brewer , or call him now Colonel
Santerre , is not silent , in the Faubourg Saint @-@ Antoine . For , meanwhile ,
the Nanci Soldiers have sent a Deputation of Ten , furnished
with documents and proofs ; who will tell another story than the
&apos;all @-@ is @-@ burning &apos; one . Which deputed Ten , before ever they reach the
Assembly Hall , assiduous Latour du Pin picks up , and on warrant of Mayor
Bailly , claps in prison ! Most unconstitutionally ; for they had officers&apos;
furloughs . Whereupon Saint @-@ Antoine , in indignant uncertainty of the
future , closes its shops . Is Bouille a traitor then , sold to Austria ?
In that case , these poor private sentinels have revolted mainly out of
Patriotism ?

New Deputation , Deputation of National Guardsmen now , sets forth from
Nanci to enlighten the Assembly . It meets the old deputed Ten returning ,
quite unexpectedly unhanged ; and proceeds thereupon with better
prospects ; but effects nothing . Deputations , Government Messengers ,
Orderlies at hand @-@ gallops , Alarms , thousand @-@ voiced Rumours , go vibrating
continually ; backwards and forwards , -- scattering distraction . Not till
the last week of August does M. de Malseigne , selected as Inspector , get
down to the scene of mutiny ; with Authority , with cash , and &apos; Decree of
the Sixth of August . &apos; He now shall see these Arrears liquidated , justice
done , or at least tumult quashed .



Chapter 2.2.V.

Inspector Malseigne .

Of Inspector Malseigne we discern , by direct light , that he is &apos; of
Herculean stature ; &apos; and infer , with probability , that he is of truculent
moustachioed aspect , -- for Royalist Officers now leave the upper lip
unshaven ; that he is of indomitable bull @-@ heart ; and also , unfortunately ,
of thick bull @-@ head .

On Tuesday the 24th of August , 1790 , he opens session as Inspecting
Commissioner ; meets those &apos; elected corporals , and soldiers that can
write . &apos; He finds the accounts of Chateau @-@ Vieux to be complex ; to require
delay and reference : he takes to haranguing , to reprimanding ; ends amid
audible grumbling . Next morning , he resumes session , not at the Townhall
as prudent Municipals counselled , but once more at the barracks .
Unfortunately Chateau @-@ Vieux , grumbling all night , will now hear of
no delay or reference ; from reprimanding on his part , it goes to
bullying , -- answered with continual cries of &quot; Jugez tout de suite , Judge
it at once ; &quot; whereupon M. de Malseigne will off in a huff . But lo ,
Chateau Vieux , swarming all about the barrack @-@ court , has sentries at
every gate ; M. de Malseigne , demanding egress , cannot get it , though
Commandant Denoue backs him ; can get only &quot; Jugez tout de suite . &quot; Here is
a nodus !

Bull @-@ hearted M. de Malseigne draws his sword ; and will force egress .
Confused splutter . M. de Malseigne &apos;s sword breaks ; he snatches
Commandant Denoue &apos;s : the sentry is wounded . M. de Malseigne , whom one
is loath to kill , does force egress , -- followed by Chateau @-@ Vieux all in
disarray ; a spectacle to Nanci . M. de Malseigne walks at a sharp pace ,
yet never runs ; wheeling from time to time , with menaces and
movements of fence ; and so reaches Denoue &apos;s house , unhurt ; which house
Chateau @-@ Vieux , in an agitated manner , invests , -- hindered as yet
from entering , by a crowd of officers formed on the staircase . M.
de Malseigne retreats by back ways to the Townhall , flustered though
undaunted ; amid an escort of National Guards . From the Townhall he ,
on the morrow , emits fresh orders , fresh plans of settlement with
Chateau @-@ Vieux ; to none of which will Chateau @-@ Vieux listen : whereupon
finally he , amid noise enough , emits order that Chateau @-@ Vieux shall
march on the morrow morning , and quarter at Sarre Louis . Chateau @-@ Vieux
flatly refuses marching ; M. de Malseigne &apos; takes act , &apos; due notarial
protest , of such refusal , -- if happily that may avail him .

This is end of Thursday ; and , indeed , of M. de Malseigne &apos;s
Inspectorship , which has lasted some fifty hours . To such length ,
in fifty hours , has he unfortunately brought it . Mestre @-@ de @-@ Camp and
Regiment du Roi hang , as it were , fluttering : Chateau @-@ Vieux is clean
gone , in what way we see . Over night , an Aide @-@ de @-@ Camp of Lafayette &apos;s ,
stationed here for such emergency , sends swift emissaries far and wide ,
to summon National Guards . The slumber of the country is broken
by clattering hoofs , by loud fraternal knockings ; every where the
Constitutional Patriot must clutch his fighting @-@ gear , and take the road
for Nanci .

And thus the Herculean Inspector has sat all Thursday , among
terror @-@ struck Municipals , a centre of confused noise : all Thursday ,
Friday , and till Saturday towards noon . Chateau @-@ Vieux , in spite of
the notarial protest , will not march a step . As many as four thousand
National Guards are dropping or pouring in ; uncertain what is expected
of them , still more uncertain what will be obtained of them . For all is
uncertainty , commotion , and suspicion : there goes a word that Bouille ,
beginning to bestir himself in the rural Cantonments eastward , is but a
Royalist traitor ; that Chateau @-@ Vieux and Patriotism are sold to Austria ,
of which latter M. de Malseigne is probably some agent . Mestre @-@ de @-@ Camp
and Roi flutter still more questionably : Chateau @-@ Vieux , far from
marching , &apos; waves red flags out of two carriages , &apos; in a passionate
manner , along the streets ; and next morning answers its Officers : &quot; Pay
us , then ; and we will march with you to the world &apos;s end ! &quot;

Under which circumstances , towards noon on Saturday , M. de Malseigne
thinks it were good perhaps to inspect the ramparts , -- on horseback . He
mounts , accordingly , with escort of three troopers . At the gate of the
city , he bids two of them wait for his return ; and with the third , a
trooper to be depended upon , he -- gallops off for Luneville ; where lies
a certain Carabineer Regiment not yet in a mutinous state ! The two
left troopers soon get uneasy ; discover how it is , and give the alarm .
Mestre @-@ de @-@ Camp , to the number of a hundred , saddles in frantic haste , as
if sold to Austria ; gallops out pellmell in chase of its Inspector . And
so they spur , and the Inspector spurs ; careering , with noise and jingle ,
up the valley of the River Meurthe , towards Luneville and the
midday sun : through an astonished country ; indeed almost their own
astonishment .

What a hunt , Actaeon @-@ like ; -- which Actaeon de Malseigne happily gains ! To
arms , ye Carabineers of Luneville : to chastise mutinous men , insulting
your General Officer , insulting your own quarters ; -- above all
things , fire soon , lest there be parleying and ye refuse to fire !
The Carabineers fire soon , exploding upon the first stragglers of
Mestre @-@ de @-@ Camp ; who shrink at the very flash , and fall back hastily
on Nanci , in a state not far from distraction . Panic and fury : sold
to Austria without an if ; so much per regiment , the very sums can be
specified ; and traitorous Malseigne is fled ! Help , O Heaven ; help , thou
Earth , -- ye unwashed Patriots ; ye too are sold like us !

Effervescent Regiment du Roi primes its firelocks , Mestre @-@ de @-@ Camp
saddles wholly : Commandant Denoue is seized , is flung in prison with a
&apos;canvass shirt &apos; ( sarreau de toile ) about him ; Chateau @-@ Vieux bursts up
the magazines ; distributes &apos; three thousand fusils &apos; to a Patriot people :
Austria shall have a hot bargain . Alas , the unhappy hunting @-@ dogs , as
we said , have hunted away their huntsman ; and do now run howling and
baying , on what trail they know not ; nigh rabid !

And so there is tumultuous march of men , through the night ; with halt
on the heights of Flinval , whence Luneville can be seen all illuminated .
Then there is parley , at four in the morning ; and reparley ; finally
there is agreement : the Carabineers give in ; Malseigne is surrendered ,
with apologies on all sides . After weary confused hours , he is even got
under way ; the Lunevillers all turning out , in the idle Sunday , to see
such departure : home @-@ going of mutinous Mestre @-@ de @-@ Camp with its Inspector
captive . Mestre @-@ de @-@ Camp accordingly marches ; the Lunevillers look .
See ! at the corner of the first street , our Inspector bounds off
again , bull @-@ hearted as he is ; amid the slash of sabres , the crackle
of musketry ; and escapes , full gallop , with only a ball lodged in his
buff @-@ jerkin . The Herculean man ! And yet it is an escape to no purpose .
For the Carabineers , to whom after the hardest Sunday &apos;s ride on record ,
he has come circling back , &apos; stand deliberating by their nocturnal
watch @-@ fires ; &apos; deliberating of Austria , of traitors , and the rage of
Mestre @-@ de @-@ Camp . So that , on the whole , the next sight we have is that
of M. de Malseigne , on the Monday afternoon , faring bull @-@ hearted through
the streets of Nanci ; in open carriage , a soldier standing over him with
drawn sword ; amid the &apos; furies of the women , &apos; hedges of National Guards ,
and confusion of Babel : to the Prison beside Commandant Denoue ! That
finally is the lodging of Inspector Malseigne . ( Deux Amis , v. 206 @-@ 251 ;
Newspapers and Documents in Hist . Parl. vii . 59 @-@ 162 . )

Surely it is time Bouille were drawing near . The Country all round ,
alarmed with watchfires , illuminated towns , and marching and rout , has
been sleepless these several nights . Nanci , with its uncertain National
Guards , with its distributed fusils , mutinous soldiers , black panic and
redhot ire , is not a City but a Bedlam .




Chapter 2.2.VI.

Bouille at Nanci .

Haste with help , thou brave Bouille : if swift help come not , all is now
verily &apos; burning ; &apos; and may burn , -- to what lengths and breadths ! Much ,
in these hours , depends on Bouille ; as it shall now fare with him , the
whole Future may be this way or be that . If , for example , he were to
loiter dubitating , and not come : if he were to come , and fail : the whole
Soldiery of France to blaze into mutiny , National Guards going some this
way , some that ; and Royalism to draw its rapier , and Sansculottism to
snatch its pike ; and the Spirit if Jacobinism , as yet young , girt with
sun @-@ rays , to grow instantaneously mature , girt with hell @-@ fire , -- as
mortals , in one night of deadly crisis , have had their heads turned
gray !

Brave Bouille is advancing fast , with the old inflexibility ; gathering
himself , unhappily &apos; in small affluences , &apos; from East , from West and
North ; and now on Tuesday morning , the last day of the month , he stands
all concentred , unhappily still in small force , at the village of
Frouarde , within some few miles . Son of Adam with a more dubious
task before him is not in the world this Tuesday morning . A weltering
inflammable sea of doubt and peril , and Bouille sure of simply one
thing , his own determination . Which one thing , indeed , may be worth
many . He puts a most firm face on the matter : &apos; Submission , or unsparing
battle and destruction ; twenty @-@ four hours to make your choice : &apos; this was
the tenor of his Proclamation ; thirty copies of which he sent yesterday
to Nanci : -- all which , we find , were intercepted and not posted . ( Compare
Bouille , Memoires , i . 153 @-@ 176 ; Deux Amis , v. 251 @-@ 271 ; Hist . Parl. ubi
supra . )

Nevertheless , at half @-@ past eleven , this morning , seemingly by way of
answer , there does wait on him at Frouarde , some Deputation from the
mutinous Regiments , from the Nanci Municipals , to see what can be done .
Bouille receives this Deputation , &apos; in a large open court adjoining his
lodging : &apos; pacified Salm , and the rest , attend also , being invited to
do it , -- all happily still in the right humour . The Mutineers pronounce
themselves with a decisiveness , which to Bouille seems insolence ; and
happily to Salm also . Salm , forgetful of the Metz staircase and
sabre , demands that the scoundrels &apos; be hanged &apos; there and then . Bouille
represses the hanging ; but answers that mutinous Soldiers have one
course , and not more than one : To liberate , with heartfelt contrition ,
Messieurs Denoue and de Malseigne ; to get ready forthwith for marching
off , whither he shall order ; and &apos; submit and repent , &apos; as the National
Assembly has decreed , as he yesterday did in thirty printed Placards
proclaim . These are his terms , unalterable as the decrees of Destiny .
Which terms as they , the Mutineer deputies , seemingly do not accept , it
were good for them to vanish from this spot , and even promptly ; with him
too , in few instants , the word will be , Forward ! The Mutineer deputies
vanish , not unpromptly ; the Municipal ones , anxious beyond right for
their own individualities , prefer abiding with Bouille .

Brave Bouille , though he puts a most firm face on the matter , knows his
position full well : how at Nanci , what with rebellious soldiers , with
uncertain National Guards , and so many distributed fusils , there rage
and roar some ten thousand fighting men ; while with himself is scarcely
the third part of that number , in National Guards also uncertain , in
mere pacified Regiments , -- for the present full of rage , and clamour to
march ; but whose rage and clamour may next moment take such a fatal new
figure . On the top of one uncertain billow , therewith to calm billows !
Bouille must &apos; abandon himself to Fortune ; &apos; who is said sometimes to
favour the brave . At half @-@ past twelve , the Mutineer deputies having
vanished , our drums beat ; we march : for Nanci ! Let Nanci bethink itself ,
then ; for Bouille has thought and determined .

And yet how shall Nanci think : not a City but a Bedlam ! Grim
Chateau @-@ Vieux is for defence to the death ; forces the Municipality to
order , by tap of drum , all citizens acquainted with artillery to turn
out , and assist in managing the cannon . On the other hand , effervescent
Regiment du Roi , is drawn up in its barracks ; quite disconsolate ,
hearing the humour Salm is in ; and ejaculates dolefully from its
thousand throats : &quot; La loi , la loi , Law , law ! &quot; Mestre @-@ de @-@ Camp blusters ,
with profane swearing , in mixed terror and furor ; National Guards look
this way and that , not knowing what to do . What a Bedlam @-@ City : as many
plans as heads ; all ordering , none obeying : quiet none , -- except the
Dead , who sleep underground , having done their fighting !

And , behold , Bouille proves as good as his word : &apos; at half @-@ past two&apos;
scouts report that he is within half a league of the gates ; rattling
along , with cannon , and array ; breathing nothing but destruction . A new
Deputation , Municipals , Mutineers , Officers , goes out to meet him ; with
passionate entreaty for yet one other hour . Bouille grants an hour .
Then , at the end thereof , no Denoue or Malseigne appearing as promised ,
he rolls his drums , and again takes the road . Towards four o &apos;clock ,
the terror @-@ struck Townsmen may see him face to face . His cannons rattle
there , in their carriages ; his vanguard is within thirty paces of the
Gate Stanislaus . Onward like a Planet , by appointed times , by law of
Nature ! What next ? Lo , flag of truce and chamade ; conjuration to halt :
Malseigne and Denoue are on the street , coming hither ; the soldiers all
repentant , ready to submit and march ! Adamantine Bouille &apos;s look alters
not ; yet the word Halt is given : gladder moment he never saw . Joy of
joys ! Malseigne and Denoue do verily issue ; escorted by National Guards ;
from streets all frantic , with sale to Austria and so forth : they salute
Bouille , unscathed . Bouille steps aside to speak with them , and with
other heads of the Town there ; having already ordered by what Gates and
Routes the mutineer Regiments shall file out .

Such colloquy with these two General Officers and other principal
Townsmen , was natural enough ; nevertheless one wishes Bouille had
postponed it , and not stepped aside . Such tumultuous inflammable masses ,
tumbling along , making way for each other ; this of keen nitrous oxide ,
that of sulphurous fire @-@ damp , -- were it not well to stand between
them , keeping them well separate , till the space be cleared ? Numerous
stragglers of Chateau @-@ Vieux and the rest have not marched with their
main columns , which are filing out by the appointed Gates , taking
station in the open meadows . National Guards are in a state of nearly
distracted uncertainty ; the populace , armed and unharmed , roll openly
delirious , -- betrayed , sold to the Austrians , sold to the Aristocrats .
There are loaded cannon with lit matches among them , and Bouille &apos;s
vanguard is halted within thirty paces of the Gate . Command dwells not
in that mad inflammable mass ; which smoulders and tumbles there , in
blind smoky rage ; which will not open the Gate when summoned ; says it
will open the cannon &apos;s throat sooner ! -- Cannonade not , O Friends , or be
it through my body ! cries heroic young Desilles , young Captain of Roi ,
clasping the murderous engine in his arms , and holding it . Chateau @-@ Vieux
Swiss , by main force , with oaths and menaces , wrench off the heroic
youth ; who undaunted , amid still louder oaths seats himself on the
touch @-@ hole . Amid still louder oaths ; with ever louder clangour , -- and ,
alas , with the loud crackle of first one , and then three other muskets ;
which explode into his body ; which roll it in the dust , -- and do also ,
in the loud madness of such moment , bring lit cannon @-@ match to ready
priming ; and so , with one thunderous belch of grapeshot , blast some
fifty of Bouille &apos;s vanguard into air !

Fatal ! That sputter of the first musket @-@ shot has kindled such a
cannon @-@ shot , such a death @-@ blaze ; and all is now redhot madness ,
conflagration as of Tophet . With demoniac rage , the Bouille vanguard
storms through that Gate Stanislaus ; with fiery sweep , sweeps Mutiny
clear away , to death , or into shelters and cellars ; from which latter ,
again , Mutiny continues firing . The ranked Regiments hear it in their
meadow ; they rush back again through the nearest Gates ; Bouille gallops
in , distracted , inaudible ; -- and now has begun , in Nanci , as in that
doomed Hall of the Nibelungen , &apos; a murder grim and great . &apos; 

Miserable : such scene of dismal aimless madness as the anger of Heaven
but rarely permits among men ! From cellar or from garret , from open
street in front , from successive corners of cross @-@ streets on each hand ,
Chateau @-@ Vieux and Patriotism keep up the murderous rolling @-@ fire , on
murderous not Unpatriotic fires . Your blue National Captain , riddled
with balls , one hardly knows on whose side fighting , requests to be
laid on the colours to die : the patriotic Woman ( name not given , deed
surviving ) screams to Chateau @-@ Vieux that it must not fire the other
cannon ; and even flings a pail of water on it , since screaming avails
not . ( Deux Amis , v. 268 . ) Thou shalt fight ; thou shalt not fight ; and
with whom shalt thou fight ! Could tumult awaken the old Dead , Burgundian
Charles the Bold might stir from under that Rotunda of his : never since
he , raging , sank in the ditches , and lost Life and Diamond , was such a
noise heard here .

Three thousand , as some count , lie mangled , gory ; the half of
Chateau @-@ Vieux has been shot , without need of Court Martial . Cavalry ,
of Mestre @-@ de @-@ Camp or their foes , can do little . Regiment du Roi was
persuaded to its barracks ; stands there palpitating . Bouille , armed with
the terrors of the Law , and favoured of Fortune , finally triumphs . In
two murderous hours he has penetrated to the grand Squares , dauntless ,
though with loss of forty officers and five hundred men : the shattered
remnants of Chateau @-@ Vieux are seeking covert . Regiment du Roi , not
effervescent now , alas no , but having effervesced , will offer to
ground its arms ; will &apos; march in a quarter of an hour . &apos; Nay these poor
effervesced require &apos; escort &apos; to march with , and get it ; though they are
thousands strong , and have thirty ball @-@ cartridges a man ! The Sun is not
yet down , when Peace , which might have come bloodless , has come bloody :
the mutinous Regiments are on march , doleful , on their three Routes ;
and from Nanci rises wail of women and men , the voice of weeping and
desolation ; the City weeping for its slain who awaken not . These streets
are empty but for victorious patrols .

Thus has Fortune , favouring the brave , dragged Bouille , as himself says ,
out of such a frightful peril , &apos; by the hair of the head . &apos; An intrepid
adamantine man this Bouille : -- had he stood in old Broglie &apos;s place ,
in those Bastille days , it might have been all different ! He has
extinguished mutiny , and immeasurable civil war . Not for nothing , as
we see ; yet at a rate which he and Constitutional Patriotism considers
cheap . Nay , as for Bouille , he , urged by subsequent contradiction which
arose , declares coldly , it was rather against his own private mind ,
and more by public military rule of duty , that he did extinguish it ,
( Bouille , i . 175 . ) -- immeasurable civil war being now the only chance .
Urged , we say , by subsequent contradiction ! Civil war , indeed , is Chaos ;
and in all vital Chaos , there is new Order shaping itself free : but what
a faith this , that of all new Orders out of Chaos and Possibility of
Man and his Universe , Louis Sixteenth and Two @-@ Chamber Monarchy were
precisely the one that would shape itself ! It is like undertaking to
throw deuce @-@ ace , say only five hundred successive times , and any other
throw to be fatal -- for Bouille . Rather thank Fortune , and Heaven ,
always , thou intrepid Bouille ; and let contradiction of its way ! Civil
war , conflagrating universally over France at this moment , might
have led to one thing or to another thing : meanwhile , to quench
conflagration , wheresoever one finds it , wheresoever one can ; this , in
all times , is the rule for man and General Officer .

But at Paris , so agitated and divided , fancy how it went , when the
continually vibrating Orderlies vibrated thither at hand gallop , with
such questionable news ! High is the gratulation ; and also deep
the indignation . An august Assembly , by overwhelming majorities ,
passionately thanks Bouille ; a King &apos;s autograph , the voices of all
Loyal , all Constitutional men run to the same tenor . A solemn National
funeral @-@ service , for the Law @-@ defenders slain at Nanci ; is said and sung
in the Champ de Mars ; Bailly , Lafayette and National Guards , all
except the few that protested , assist . With pomp and circumstance , with
episcopal Calicoes in tricolor girdles , Altar of Fatherland smoking
with cassolettes , or incense @-@ kettles ; the vast Champ @-@ de @-@ Mars wholly
hung round with black mortcloth , -- which mortcloth and expenditure Marat
thinks had better have been laid out in bread , in these dear days , and
given to the hungry living Patriot . ( Ami du Peuple in Hist . Parl . , ubi
supra . ) On the other hand , living Patriotism , and Saint @-@ Antoine , which
we have seen noisily closing its shops and such like , assembles now
&apos;to the number of forty thousand ; &apos; and , with loud cries , under the very
windows of the thanking National Assembly , demands revenge for murdered
Brothers , judgment on Bouille , and instant dismissal of War @-@ Minister
Latour du Pin .

At sound and sight of which things , if not War @-@ Minister Latour , yet
&apos;Adored Minister &apos; Necker , sees good on the 3d of September 1790 , to
withdraw softly almost privily , -- with an eye to the &apos; recovery of his
health . &apos; Home to native Switzerland ; not as he last came ; lucky to reach
it alive ! Fifteen months ago , we saw him coming , with escort of horse ,
with sound of clarion and trumpet : and now at Arcis @-@ sur @-@ Aube , while he
departs unescorted soundless , the Populace and Municipals stop him as
a fugitive , are not unlike massacring him as a traitor ; the National
Assembly , consulted on the matter , gives him free egress as a nullity .
Such an unstable &apos; drift @-@ mould of Accident &apos; is the substance of this
lower world , for them that dwell in houses of clay ; so , especially
in hot regions and times , do the proudest palaces we build of it take
wings , and become Sahara sand @-@ palaces , spinning many pillared in the
whirlwind , and bury us under their sand ! --

In spite of the forty thousand , the National Assembly persists in
its thanks ; and Royalist Latour du Pin continues Minister . The forty
thousand assemble next day , as loud as ever ; roll towards Latour &apos;s
Hotel ; find cannon on the porch @-@ steps with flambeau lit ; and have to
retire elsewhither , and digest their spleen , or re @-@ absorb it into the
blood .

Over in Lorraine , meanwhile , they of the distributed fusils , ringleaders
of Mestre @-@ de @-@ Camp , of Roi , have got marked out for judgment ; -- yet shall
never get judged . Briefer is the doom of Chateau @-@ Vieux . Chateau @-@ Vieux
is , by Swiss law , given up for instant trial in Court @-@ Martial of its own
officers . Which Court @-@ Martial , with all brevity ( in not many hours ) ,
has hanged some Twenty @-@ three , on conspicuous gibbets ; marched some
Three @-@ score in chains to the Galleys ; and so , to appearance , finished
the matter off . Hanged men do cease for ever from this Earth ; but out
of chains and the Galleys there may be resuscitation in triumph .
Resuscitation for the chained Hero ; and even for the chained Scoundrel ,
or Semi @-@ scoundrel ! Scottish John Knox , such World @-@ Hero , as we know , sat
once nevertheless pulling grim @-@ taciturn at the oar of French Galley , &apos; in
the Water of Lore ; &apos; and even flung their Virgin @-@ Mary over , instead of
kissing her , -- as &apos; a pented bredd , &apos; or timber Virgin , who could
naturally swim . ( Knox &apos;s History of the Reformation , b. i . ) So , ye of
Chateau @-@ Vieux , tug patiently , not without hope !

But indeed at Nanci generally , Aristocracy rides triumphant , rough .
Bouille is gone again , the second day ; an Aristocrat Municipality , with
free course , is as cruel as it had before been cowardly . The Daughter
Society , as the mother of the whole mischief , lies ignominiously
suppressed ; the Prisons can hold no more ; bereaved down @-@ beaten
Patriotism murmurs , not loud but deep . Here and in the neighbouring
Towns , &apos; flattened balls &apos; picked from the streets of Nanci are worn at
buttonholes : balls flattened in carrying death to Patriotism ; men wear
them there , in perpetual memento of revenge . Mutineer Deserters roam the
woods ; have to demand charity at the musket &apos;s end . All is dissolution ,
mutual rancour , gloom and despair : -- till National @-@ Assembly Commissioners
arrive , with a steady gentle flame of Constitutionalism in their hearts ;
who gently lift up the down @-@ trodden , gently pull down the too uplifted ;
reinstate the Daughter Society , recall the Mutineer Deserter ; gradually
levelling , strive in all wise ways to smooth and soothe . With such
gradual mild levelling on the one side ; as with solemn funeral @-@ service ,
Cassolettes , Courts @-@ Martial , National thanks , -- all that Officiality can
do is done . The buttonhole will drop its flat ball ; the black ashes , so
far as may be , get green again .

This is the &apos; Affair of Nanci ; &apos; by some called the &apos; Massacre of
Nanci ; &apos; -- properly speaking , the unsightly wrong @-@ side of that thrice
glorious Feast of Pikes , the right @-@ side of which formed a spectacle for
the very gods . Right @-@ side and wrong lie always so near : the one was in
July , in August the other ! Theatres , the theatres over in London , are
bright with their pasteboard simulacrum of that &apos; Federation of the
French People , &apos; brought out as Drama : this of Nanci , we may say , though
not played in any pasteboard Theatre , did for many months enact itself ,
and even walk spectrally -- in all French heads . For the news of it fly
pealing through all France ; awakening , in town and village , in clubroom ,
messroom , to the utmost borders , some mimic reflex or imaginative
repetition of the business ; always with the angry questionable
assertion : It was right ; It was wrong . Whereby come controversies ,
duels , embitterment , vain jargon ; the hastening forward , the augmenting
and intensifying of whatever new explosions lie in store for us .

Meanwhile , at this cost or at that , the mutiny , as we say , is stilled .
The French Army has neither burst up in universal simultaneous delirium ;
nor been at once disbanded , put an end to , and made new again . It
must die in the chronic manner , through years , by inches ; with partial
revolts , as of Brest Sailors or the like , which dare not spread ;
with men unhappy , insubordinate ; officers unhappier , in Royalist
moustachioes , taking horse , singly or in bodies , across the Rhine : ( See
Dampmartin , i . 249 , &amp; c . &amp; c . ) sick dissatisfaction , sick disgust on
both sides ; the Army moribund , fit for no duty : -- till it do , in that
unexpected manner , Phoenix @-@ like , with long throes , get both dead and
newborn ; then start forth strong , nay stronger and even strongest .

Thus much was the brave Bouille hitherto fated to do . Wherewith let
him again fade into dimness ; and at Metz or the rural Cantonments ,
assiduously drilling , mysteriously diplomatising , in scheme within
scheme , hover as formerly a faint shadow , the hope of Royalty .




BOOK 2.III.

THE TUILERIES


Chapter 2.3.I.

Epimenides .

How true that there is nothing dead in this Universe ; that what we call
dead is only changed , its forces working in inverse order ! &apos; The leaf
that lies rotting in moist winds , &apos; says one , &apos; has still force ; else how
could it rot ? &apos; Our whole Universe is but an infinite Complex of Forces ;
thousandfold , from Gravitation up to Thought and Will ; man &apos;s Freedom
environed with Necessity of Nature : in all which nothing at any moment
slumbers , but all is for ever awake and busy . The thing that lies
isolated inactive thou shalt nowhere discover ; seek every where from
the granite mountain , slow @-@ mouldering since Creation , to the passing
cloud @-@ vapour , to the living man ; to the action , to the spoken word of
man . The word that is spoken , as we know , flies @-@ irrevocable : not less ,
but more , the action that is done . &apos; The gods themselves , &apos; sings Pindar ,
&apos;cannot annihilate the action that is done . &apos; No : this , once done , is
done always ; cast forth into endless Time ; and , long conspicuous or soon
hidden , must verily work and grow for ever there , an indestructible new
element in the Infinite of Things . Or , indeed , what is this Infinite of
Things itself , which men name Universe , but an action , a sum @-@ total
of Actions and Activities ? The living ready @-@ made sum @-@ total of these
three , -- which Calculation cannot add , cannot bring on its tablets ; yet
the sum , we say , is written visible : All that has been done , All that
is doing , All that will be done ! Understand it well , the Thing thou
beholdest , that Thing is an Action , the product and expression of
exerted Force : the All of Things is an infinite conjugation of the verb
To do . Shoreless Fountain @-@ Ocean of Force , of power to do ; wherein
Force rolls and circles , billowing , many @-@ streamed , harmonious ; wide
as Immensity , deep as Eternity ; beautiful and terrible , not to be
comprehended : this is what man names Existence and Universe ; this
thousand @-@ tinted Flame @-@ image , at once veil and revelation , reflex such as
he , in his poor brain and heart , can paint , of One Unnameable dwelling
in inaccessible light ! From beyond the Star @-@ galaxies , from before the
Beginning of Days , it billows and rolls , -- round thee , nay thyself art of
it , in this point of Space where thou now standest , in this moment which
thy clock measures .

Or apart from all Transcendentalism , is it not a plain truth of sense ,
which the duller mind can even consider as a truism , that human things
wholly are in continual movement , and action and reaction ; working
continually forward , phasis after phasis , by unalterable laws , towards
prescribed issues ? How often must we say , and yet not rightly lay
to heart : The seed that is sown , it will spring ! Given the summer &apos;s
blossoming , then there is also given the autumnal withering : so is it
ordered not with seedfields only , but with transactions , arrangements ,
philosophies , societies , French Revolutions , whatsoever man works with
in this lower world . The Beginning holds in it the End , and all that
leads thereto ; as the acorn does the oak and its fortunes . Solemn
enough , did we think of it , -- which unhappily and also happily we do not
very much ! Thou there canst begin ; the Beginning is for thee , and there :
but where , and of what sort , and for whom will the End be ? All grows ,
and seeks and endures its destinies : consider likewise how much grows ,
as the trees do , whether we think of it or not . So that when your
Epimenides , your somnolent Peter Klaus , since named Rip van Winkle ,
awakens again , he finds it a changed world . In that seven @-@ years &apos; sleep
of his , so much has changed ! All that is without us will change while
we think not of it ; much even that is within us . The truth that was
yesterday a restless Problem , has to @-@ day grown a Belief burning to
be uttered : on the morrow , contradiction has exasperated it into mad
Fanaticism ; obstruction has dulled it into sick Inertness ; it is sinking
towards silence , of satisfaction or of resignation . To @-@ day is not
Yesterday , for man or for thing . Yesterday there was the oath of Love ;
today has come the curse of Hate . Not willingly : ah , no ; but it could
not help coming . The golden radiance of youth , would it willingly have
tarnished itself into the dimness of old age ? -- Fearful : how we stand
enveloped , deep @-@ sunk , in that Mystery of TIME ; and are Sons of Time ;
fashioned and woven out of Time ; and on us , and on all that we have , or
see , or do , is written : Rest not , Continue not , Forward to thy doom !

But in seasons of Revolution , which indeed distinguish themselves from
common seasons by their velocity mainly , your miraculous Seven @-@ sleeper
might , with miracle enough , wake sooner : not by the century , or seven
years , need he sleep ; often not by the seven months . Fancy , for example ,
some new Peter Klaus , sated with the jubilee of that Federation day , had
lain down , say directly after the Blessing of Talleyrand ; and , reckoning
it all safe now , had fallen composedly asleep under the timber @-@ work of
the Fatherland &apos;s Altar ; to sleep there , not twenty @-@ one years , but as
it were year and day . The cannonading of Nanci , so far off , does not
disturb him ; nor does the black mortcloth , close at hand , nor the
requiems chanted , and minute guns , incense @-@ pans and concourse right over
his head : none of these ; but Peter sleeps through them all . Through one
circling year , as we say ; from July 14th of 1790 , till July the 17th of
1791 : but on that latter day , no Klaus , nor most leaden Epimenides ,
only the Dead could continue sleeping ; and so our miraculous Peter Klaus
awakens . With what eyes , O Peter ! Earth and sky have still their joyous
July look , and the Champ @-@ de @-@ Mars is multitudinous with men : but the
jubilee @-@ huzzahing has become Bedlam @-@ shrieking , of terror and revenge ;
not blessing of Talleyrand , or any blessing , but cursing , imprecation
and shrill wail ; our cannon @-@ salvoes are turned to sharp shot ; for
swinging of incense @-@ pans and Eighty @-@ three Departmental Banners , we have
waving of the one sanguinous Drapeau @-@ Rouge . -- Thou foolish Klaus ! The one
lay in the other , the one was the other minus Time ; even as Hannibal &apos;s
rock @-@ rending vinegar lay in the sweet new wine . That sweet Federation
was of last year ; this sour Divulsion is the self @-@ same substance , only
older by the appointed days .

No miraculous Klaus or Epimenides sleeps in these times : and yet , may
not many a man , if of due opacity and levity , act the same miracle in a
natural way ; we mean , with his eyes open ? Eyes has he , but he sees not ,
except what is under his nose . With a sparkling briskness of glance , as
if he not only saw but saw through , such a one goes whisking , assiduous ,
in his circle of officialities ; not dreaming but that it is the whole
world : as , indeed , where your vision terminates , does not inanity begin
there , and the world &apos;s end clearly declares itself -- to you ? Whereby
our brisk sparkling assiduous official person ( call him , for instance ,
Lafayette ) , suddenly startled , after year and day , by huge grape @-@ shot
tumult , stares not less astonished at it than Peter Klaus would have
done . Such natural @-@ miracle Lafayette can perform ; and indeed not he only
but most other officials , non @-@ officials , and generally the whole French
People can perform it ; and do bounce up , ever and anon , like amazed
Seven @-@ sleepers awakening ; awakening amazed at the noise they themselves
make . So strangely is Freedom , as we say , environed in Necessity ; such
a singular Somnambulism , of Conscious and Unconscious , of Voluntary and
Involuntary , is this life of man . If any where in the world there was
astonishment that the Federation Oath went into grape @-@ shot , surely
of all persons the French , first swearers and then shooters , felt
astonished the most .

Alas , offences must come . The sublime Feast of Pikes , with its
effulgence of brotherly love , unknown since the Age of Gold , has changed
nothing . That prurient heat in Twenty @-@ five millions of hearts is not
cooled thereby ; but is still hot , nay hotter . Lift off the pressure of
command from so many millions ; all pressure or binding rule , except such
melodramatic Federation Oath as they have bound themselves with ! For
&apos;Thou shalt &apos; was from of old the condition of man &apos;s being , and his weal
and blessedness was in obeying that . Wo for him when , were it on hest
of the clearest necessity , rebellion , disloyal isolation , and mere &apos; I
will &apos; , becomes his rule ! But the Gospel of Jean @-@ Jacques has come , and
the first Sacrament of it has been celebrated : all things , as we
say , are got into hot and hotter prurience ; and must go on pruriently
fermenting , in continual change noted or unnoted .

&apos;Worn out with disgusts , &apos; Captain after Captain , in Royalist
moustachioes , mounts his warhorse , or his Rozinante war @-@ garron , and
rides minatory across the Rhine ; till all have ridden . Neither does
civic Emigration cease : Seigneur after Seigneur must , in like manner ,
ride or roll ; impelled to it , and even compelled . For the very Peasants
despise him in that he dare not join his order and fight . ( Dampmartin ,
passim . ) Can he bear to have a Distaff , a Quenouille sent to him ; say
in copper @-@ plate shadow , by post ; or fixed up in wooden reality over his
gate @-@ lintel : as if he were no Hercules but an Omphale ? Such scutcheon
they forward to him diligently from behind the Rhine ; till he too bestir
himself and march , and in sour humour , another Lord of Land is gone ,
not taking the Land with him . Nay , what of Captains and emigrating
Seigneurs ? There is not an angry word on any of those Twenty @-@ five
million French tongues , and indeed not an angry thought in their hearts ,
but is some fraction of the great Battle . Add many successions of angry
words together , you have the manual brawl ; add brawls together , with the
festering sorrows they leave , and they rise to riots and revolts .
One reverend thing after another ceases to meet reverence : in visible
material combustion , chateau after chateau mounts up ; in spiritual
invisible combustion , one authority after another . With noise and
glare , or noisily and unnoted , a whole Old System of things is vanishing
piecemeal : on the morrow thou shalt look and it is not .



Chapter 2.3.II.

The Wakeful .

Sleep who will , cradled in hope and short vision , like Lafayette ,
&apos;who always in the danger done sees the last danger that will threaten
him , &apos; -- Time is not sleeping , nor Time &apos;s seedfield .

That sacred Herald &apos;s @-@ College of a new Dynasty ; we mean the Sixty and
odd Billstickers with their leaden badges , are not sleeping . Daily they ,
with pastepot and cross @-@ staff , new clothe the walls of Paris in colours
of the rainbow : authoritative heraldic , as we say , or indeed almost
magical thaumaturgic ; for no Placard @-@ Journal that they paste but
will convince some soul or souls of man . The Hawkers bawl ; and the
Balladsingers : great Journalism blows and blusters , through all its
throats , forth from Paris towards all corners of France , like an Aeolus&apos;
Cave ; keeping alive all manner of fires .

Throats or Journals there are , as men count , ( Mercier , iii . 163 . ) to the
number of some hundred and thirty @-@ three . Of various calibre ; from your
Cheniers , Gorsases , Camilles , down to your Marat , down now to your
incipient Hebert of the Pere Duchesne ; these blow , with fierce weight of
argument or quick light banter , for the Rights of man : Durosoys , Royous ,
Peltiers , Sulleaus , equally with mixed tactics , inclusive , singular to
say , of much profane Parody , ( See Hist . Parl. vii . 51 . ) are blowing for
Altar and Throne . As for Marat the People &apos;s @-@ Friend , his voice is as that
of the bullfrog , or bittern by the solitary pools ; he , unseen of men ,
croaks harsh thunder , and that alone continually , -- of indignation ,
suspicion , incurable sorrow . The People are sinking towards ruin , near
starvation itself : &apos; My dear friends , &apos; cries he , &apos; your indigence is not
the fruit of vices nor of idleness , you have a right to life , as good
as Louis XVI . , or the happiest of the century . What man can say he has
a right to dine , when you have no bread ? &apos; ( Ami du Peuple , No. 306 . See
other Excerpts in Hist . Parl. viii . 139 @-@ 149 , 428 @-@ 433 ; ix . 85 @-@ 93 , &amp; c . )
The People sinking on the one hand : on the other hand , nothing but
wretched Sieur Motiers , treasonous Riquetti Mirabeaus ; traitors , or else
shadows , and simulacra of Quacks , to be seen in high places , look where
you will ! Men that go mincing , grimacing , with plausible speech and
brushed raiment ; hollow within : Quacks Political ; Quacks scientific ,
Academical ; all with a fellow @-@ feeling for each other , and kind of Quack
public @-@ spirit ! Not great Lavoisier himself , or any of the Forty can
escape this rough tongue ; which wants not fanatic sincerity , nor ,
strangest of all , a certain rough caustic sense . And then the
&apos;three thousand gaming @-@ houses &apos; that are in Paris ; cesspools for the
scoundrelism of the world ; sinks of iniquity and debauchery , -- whereas
without good morals Liberty is impossible ! There , in these Dens of
Satan , which one knows , and perseveringly denounces , do Sieur Motier &apos;s
mouchards consort and colleague ; battening vampyre @-@ like on a
People next @-@ door to starvation . &apos; O Peuple ! &apos; cries he oftimes , with
heart @-@ rending accent . Treason , delusion , vampyrism , scoundrelism , from
Dan to Beersheba ! The soul of Marat is sick with the sight : but what
remedy ? To erect &apos; Eight Hundred gibbets , &apos; in convenient rows , and
proceed to hoisting ; &apos; Riquetti on the first of them ! &apos; Such is the brief
recipe of Marat , Friend of the People .

So blow and bluster the Hundred and thirty @-@ three : nor , as would seem ,
are these sufficient ; for there are benighted nooks in France , to which
Newspapers do not reach ; and every where is &apos; such an appetite for news
as was never seen in any country . &apos; Let an expeditious Dampmartin , on
furlough , set out to return home from Paris , ( Dampmartin , i . 184 . ) he
cannot get along for &apos; peasants stopping him on the highway ; overwhelming
him with questions : &apos; the Maitre de Poste will not send out the horses
till you have well nigh quarrelled with him , but asks always , What news ?
At Autun , &apos; in spite of the rigorous frost &apos; for it is now January , 1791,
nothing will serve but you must gather your wayworn limbs , and
thoughts , and &apos; speak to the multitudes from a window opening into the
market @-@ place . &apos; It is the shortest method : This , good Christian people ,
is verily what an August Assembly seemed to me to be doing ; this and no
other is the news ;

&apos;Now my weary lips I close ;
Leave me , leave me to repose . &apos; 

The good Dampmartin ! -- But , on the whole , are not Nations astonishingly
true to their National character ; which indeed runs in the blood ?
Nineteen hundred years ago , Julius Caesar , with his quick sure eye , took
note how the Gauls waylaid men . &apos; It is a habit of theirs , &apos; says he , &apos; to
stop travellers , were it even by constraint , and inquire whatsoever
each of them may have heard or known about any sort of matter : in their
towns , the common people beset the passing trader ; demanding to hear
from what regions he came , what things he got acquainted with there .
Excited by which rumours and hearsays they will decide about the
weightiest matters ; and necessarily repent next moment that they did it ,
on such guidance of uncertain reports , and many a traveller answering
with mere fictions to please them , and get off . &apos; ( De Bello Gallico ,
iv . 5 . ) Nineteen hundred years ; and good Dampmartin , wayworn , in winter
frost , probably with scant light of stars and fish @-@ oil , still perorates
from the Inn @-@ window ! This People is no longer called Gaulish ; and it has
wholly become braccatus , has got breeches , and suffered change enough :
certain fierce German Franken came storming over ; and , so to speak ,
vaulted on the back of it ; and always after , in their grim tenacious
way , have ridden it bridled ; for German is , by his very name ,
Guerre @-@ man , or man that wars and gars . And so the People , as we say , is
now called French or Frankish : nevertheless , does not the old Gaulish
and Gaelic Celthood , with its vehemence , effervescent promptitude , and
what good and ill it had , still vindicate itself little adulterated ? --

For the rest , that in such prurient confusion , Clubbism thrives and
spreads , need not be said . Already the Mother of Patriotism , sitting
in the Jacobins , shines supreme over all ; and has paled the poor lunar
light of that Monarchic Club near to final extinction . She , we say ,
shines supreme , girt with sun @-@ light , not yet with infernal lightning ;
reverenced , not without fear , by Municipal Authorities ; counting her
Barnaves , Lameths , Petions , of a National Assembly ; most gladly of all ,
her Robespierre . Cordeliers , again , your Hebert , Vincent , Bibliopolist
Momoro , groan audibly that a tyrannous Mayor and Sieur Motier harrow
them with the sharp tribula of Law , intent apparently to suppress them
by tribulation . How the Jacobin Mother @-@ Society , as hinted formerly ,
sheds forth Cordeliers on this hand , and then Feuillans on that ; the
Cordeliers on this hand , and then Feuillans on that ; the Cordeliers
&apos;an elixir or double @-@ distillation of Jacobin Patriotism ; &apos; the other a
wide @-@ spread weak dilution thereof ; how she will re @-@ absorb the former
into her Mother @-@ bosom , and stormfully dissipate the latter
into Nonentity : how she breeds and brings forth Three Hundred
Daughter @-@ Societies ; her rearing of them , her correspondence , her
endeavourings and continual travail : how , under an old figure ,
Jacobinism shoots forth organic filaments to the utmost corners of
confused dissolved France ; organising it anew : -- this properly is the
grand fact of the Time .

To passionate Constitutionalism , still more to Royalism , which see all
their own Clubs fail and die , Clubbism will naturally grow to seem the
root of all evil . Nevertheless Clubbism is not death , but rather
new organisation , and life out of death : destructive , indeed , of the
remnants of the Old ; but to the New important , indispensable . That man
can co @-@ operate and hold communion with man , herein lies his miraculous
strength . In hut or hamlet , Patriotism mourns not now like voice in
the desert : it can walk to the nearest Town ; and there , in the
Daughter @-@ Society , make its ejaculation into an articulate oration , into
an action , guided forward by the Mother of Patriotism herself . All
Clubs of Constitutionalists , and such like , fail , one after another ,
as shallow fountains : Jacobinism alone has gone down to the deep
subterranean lake of waters ; and may , unless filled in , flow there ,
copious , continual , like an Artesian well . Till the Great Deep have
drained itself up : and all be flooded and submerged , and Noah &apos;s Deluge
out @-@ deluged !

On the other hand , Claude Fauchet , preparing mankind for a Golden Age
now apparently just at hand , has opened his Cercle Social , with clerks ,
corresponding boards , and so forth ; in the precincts of the Palais
Royal . It is Te @-@ Deum Fauchet ; the same who preached on Franklin &apos;s Death ,
in that huge Medicean rotunda of the Halle aux bleds . He here , this
winter , by Printing @-@ press and melodious Colloquy , spreads bruit
of himself to the utmost City @-@ barriers . &apos; Ten thousand persons &apos; of
respectability attend there ; and listen to this &apos; Procureur @-@ General de
la Verite , Attorney @-@ General of Truth , &apos; so has he dubbed himself ; to his
sage Condorcet , or other eloquent coadjutor . Eloquent Attorney @-@ General !
He blows out from him , better or worse , what crude or ripe thing he
holds : not without result to himself ; for it leads to a Bishoprick ,
though only a Constitutional one . Fauchet approves himself a
glib @-@ tongued , strong @-@ lunged , whole @-@ hearted human individual : much
flowing matter there is , and really of the better sort , about Right ,
Nature , Benevolence , Progress ; which flowing matter , whether &apos; it is
pantheistic , &apos; or is pot @-@ theistic , only the greener mind , in these days ,
need read . Busy Brissot was long ago of purpose to establish precisely
some such regenerative Social Circle : nay he had tried it , in
&apos;Newman @-@ street Oxford @-@ street , &apos; of the Fog Babylon ; and failed , -- as some
say , surreptitiously pocketing the cash . Fauchet , not Brissot , was
fated to be the happy man ; whereat , however , generous Brissot will
with sincere heart sing a timber @-@ toned Nunc Domine . ( See Brissot ,
Patriote @-@ Francais Newspaper ; Fauchet , Bouche @-@ de @-@ Fer , &amp; c . ( excerpted
in Hist . Parl. viii . , ix . , et seqq . ) . ) But &apos; ten thousand persons of
respectability : &apos; what a bulk have many things in proportion to their
magnitude ! This Cercle Social , for which Brissot chants in sincere
timber @-@ tones such Nunc Domine , what is it ? Unfortunately wind and
shadow . The main reality one finds in it now , is perhaps this : that an
&apos;Attorney @-@ General of Truth &apos; did once take shape of a body , as Son of
Adam , on our Earth , though but for months or moments ; and ten thousand
persons of respectability attended , ere yet Chaos and Nox had reabsorbed
him .

Hundred and thirty @-@ three Paris Journals ; regenerative Social Circle ;
oratory , in Mother and Daughter Societies , from the balconies of Inns ,
by chimney @-@ nook , at dinner @-@ table , -- polemical , ending many times in
duel ! Add ever , like a constant growling accompaniment of bass Discord :
scarcity of work , scarcity of food . The winter is hard and cold ; ragged
Bakers &apos; -queues , like a black tattered flag @-@ of @-@ distress , wave out
ever and anon . It is the third of our Hunger @-@ years this new year of
a glorious Revolution . The rich man when invited to dinner , in such
distress @-@ seasons , feels bound in politeness to carry his own bread in
his pocket : how the poor dine ? And your glorious Revolution has done it ,
cries one . And our glorious Revolution is subtilety , by black traitors
worthy of the Lamp @-@ iron , perverted to do it , cries another ! Who
will paint the huge whirlpool wherein France , all shivered into wild
incoherence , whirls ? The jarring that went on under every French roof ,
in every French heart ; the diseased things that were spoken , done , the
sum @-@ total whereof is the French Revolution , tongue of man cannot tell .
Nor the laws of action that work unseen in the depths of that huge
blind Incoherence ! With amazement , not with measurement , men look on the
Immeasurable ; not knowing its laws ; seeing , with all different degrees
of knowledge , what new phases , and results of event , its laws bring
forth . France is as a monstrous Galvanic Mass , wherein all sorts of far
stranger than chemical galvanic or electric forces and substances are
at work ; electrifying one another , positive and negative ; filling with
electricity your Leyden @-@ jars , -- Twenty @-@ five millions in number ! As the
jars get full , there will , from time to time , be , on slight hint , an
explosion .



Chapter 2.3.III.

Sword in Hand .

On such wonderful basis , however , has Law , Royalty , Authority , and
whatever yet exists of visible Order , to maintain itself , while it can .
Here , as in that Commixture of the Four Elements did the Anarch Old , has
an august Assembly spread its pavilion ; curtained by the dark infinite
of discords ; founded on the wavering bottomless of the Abyss ; and keeps
continual hubbub . Time is around it , and Eternity , and the Inane ; and it
does what it can , what is given it to do .

Glancing reluctantly in , once more , we discern little that is edifying :
a Constitutional Theory of Defective Verbs struggling forward , with
perseverance , amid endless interruptions : Mirabeau , from his tribune ,
with the weight of his name and genius , awing down much Jacobin
violence ; which in return vents itself the louder over in its Jacobins
Hall , and even reads him sharp lectures there . ( Camille &apos;s Journal ( in
Hist . Parl. ix . 366 @-@ 85 ) . ) This man &apos;s path is mysterious , questionable ;
difficult , and he walks without companion in it . Pure Patriotism does
not now count him among her chosen ; pure Royalism abhors him : yet his
weight with the world is overwhelming . Let him travel on , companionless ,
unwavering , whither he is bound , -- while it is yet day with him , and the
night has not come .

But the chosen band of pure Patriot brothers is small ; counting only
some Thirty , seated now on the extreme tip of the Left , separate
from the world . A virtuous Petion ; an incorruptible Robespierre , most
consistent , incorruptible of thin acrid men ; Triumvirs Barnave , Duport ,
Lameth , great in speech , thought , action , each according to his kind ; a
lean old Goupil de Prefeln : on these and what will follow them has pure
Patriotism to depend .

There too , conspicuous among the Thirty , if seldom audible , Philippe
d &apos;Orleans may be seen sitting : in dim fuliginous bewilderment ; having ,
one might say , arrived at Chaos ! Gleams there are , at once of a
Lieutenancy and Regency ; debates in the Assembly itself , of succession
to the Throne &apos; in case the present Branch should fail ; &apos; and Philippe ,
they say , walked anxiously , in silence , through the corridors , till such
high argument were done : but it came all to nothing ; Mirabeau , glaring
into the man , and through him , had to ejaculate in strong untranslatable
language : Ce j -- f -- ne vaut pas la peine qu &apos;on se donne pour lui . It
came all to nothing ; and in the meanwhile Philippe &apos;s money , they say , is
gone ! Could he refuse a little cash to the gifted Patriot , in want
only of that ; he himself in want of all but that ? Not a pamphlet can
be printed without cash ; or indeed written , without food purchasable by
cash . Without cash your hopefullest Projector cannot stir from the spot :
individual patriotic or other Projects require cash : how much more do
wide @-@ spread Intrigues , which live and exist by cash ; lying widespread ,
with dragon @-@ appetite for cash ; fit to swallow Princedoms ! And so Prince
Philippe , amid his Sillerys , Lacloses , and confused Sons of Night , has
rolled along : the centre of the strangest cloudy coil ; out of which
has visibly come , as we often say , an Epic Preternatural Machinery
of SUSPICION ; and within which there has dwelt and worked , -- what
specialties of treason , stratagem , aimed or aimless endeavour towards
mischief , no party living ( if it be not the Presiding Genius of it ,
Prince of the Power of the Air ) has now any chance to know . Camille &apos;s
conjecture is the likeliest : that poor Philippe did mount up , a little
way , in treasonable speculation , as he mounted formerly in one of the
earliest Balloons ; but , frightened at the new position he was getting
into , had soon turned the cock again , and come down . More fool than he
rose ! To create Preternatural Suspicion , this was his function in
the Revolutionary Epos . But now if he have lost his cornucopia of
ready @-@ money , what else had he to lose ? In thick darkness , inward and
outward , he must welter and flounder on , in that piteous death @-@ element ,
the hapless man . Once , or even twice , we shall still behold him emerged ;
struggling out of the thick death @-@ element : in vain . For one moment ,
it is the last moment , he starts aloft , or is flung aloft , even into
clearness and a kind of memorability , -- to sink then for evermore !

The Cote Droit persists no less ; nay with more animation than ever ,
though hope has now well nigh fled . Tough Abbe Maury , when the obscure
country Royalist grasps his hand with transport of thanks , answers ,
rolling his indomitable brazen head : &quot; Helas , Monsieur , all that I do
here is as good as simply nothing . &quot; Gallant Faussigny , visible this
one time in History , advances frantic , into the middle of the Hall ,
exclaiming : &quot; There is but one way of dealing with it , and that is
to fall sword in hand on those gentry there , sabre a la main sur ces
gaillards la , &quot; ( Moniteur , Seance du 21 Aout , 1790 . ) franticly indicating
our chosen Thirty on the extreme tip of the Left ! Whereupon is clangour
and clamour , debate , repentance , -- evaporation . Things ripen towards
downright incompatibility , and what is called &apos; scission : &apos; that fierce
theoretic onslaught of Faussigny &apos;s was in August , 1790 ; next August will
not have come , till a famed Two Hundred and Ninety @-@ two , the chosen of
Royalism , make solemn final &apos; scission &apos; from an Assembly given up to
faction ; and depart , shaking the dust off their feet .

Connected with this matter of sword in hand , there is yet another thing
to be noted . Of duels we have sometimes spoken : how , in all parts
of France , innumerable duels were fought ; and argumentative men
and messmates , flinging down the wine @-@ cup and weapons of reason and
repartee , met in the measured field ; to part bleeding ; or perhaps not to
part , but to fall mutually skewered through with iron , their wrath and
life alike ending , -- and die as fools die . Long has this lasted , and
still lasts . But now it would seem as if in an august Assembly itself ,
traitorous Royalism , in its despair , had taken to a new course : that of
cutting off Patriotism by systematic duel ! Bully @-@ swordsmen , &apos; Spadassins&apos;
of that party , go swaggering ; or indeed they can be had for a trifle of
money . &apos; Twelve Spadassins &apos; were seen , by the yellow eye of Journalism ,
&apos;arriving recently out of Switzerland ; &apos; also &apos; a considerable number
of Assassins , nombre considerable d &apos;assassins , exercising in
fencing @-@ schools and at pistol @-@ targets . &apos; Any Patriot Deputy of mark
can be called out ; let him escape one time , or ten times , a time there
necessarily is when he must fall , and France mourn . How many cartels has
Mirabeau had ; especially while he was the People &apos;s champion ! Cartels by
the hundred : which he , since the Constitution must be made first , and
his time is precious , answers now always with a kind of stereotype
formula : &quot; Monsieur , you are put upon my List ; but I warn you that it is
long , and I grant no preferences . &quot;

Then , in Autumn , had we not the Duel of Cazales and Barnave ; the two
chief masters of tongue @-@ shot meeting now to exchange pistol @-@ shot ? For
Cazales , chief of the Royalists , whom we call &apos; Blacks or Noirs , &apos; said ,
in a moment of passion , &quot; the Patriots were sheer Brigands , &quot; nay in
so speaking , he darted or seemed to dart , a fire @-@ glance specially
at Barnave ; who thereupon could not but reply by fire @-@ glances , -- by
adjournment to the Bois @-@ de @-@ Boulogne . Barnave &apos;s second shot took effect :
on Cazales &apos;s hat . The &apos; front nook &apos; of a triangular Felt , such as mortals
then wore , deadened the ball ; and saved that fine brow from more than
temporary injury . But how easily might the lot have fallen the other
way , and Barnave &apos;s hat not been so good ! Patriotism raises its loud
denunciation of Duelling in general ; petitions an august Assembly to
stop such Feudal barbarism by law . Barbarism and solecism : for will it
convince or convict any man to blow half an ounce of lead through the
head of him ? Surely not . -- Barnave was received at the Jacobins with
embraces , yet with rebukes .

Mindful of which , and also that his repetition in America was that of
headlong foolhardiness rather , and want of brain not of heart , Charles
Lameth does , on the eleventh day of November , with little emotion ,
decline attending some hot young Gentleman from Artois , come expressly
to challenge him : nay indeed he first coldly engages to attend ; then
coldly permits two Friends to attend instead of him , and shame the
young Gentleman out of it , which they successfully do . A cold procedure ;
satisfactory to the two Friends , to Lameth and the hot young Gentleman ;
whereby , one might have fancied , the whole matter was cooled down .

Not so , however : Lameth , proceeding to his senatorial duties , in the
decline of the day , is met in those Assembly corridors by nothing but
Royalist brocards ; sniffs , huffs , and open insults . Human patience has
its limits : &quot; Monsieur , &quot; said Lameth , breaking silence to one Lautrec ,
a man with hunchback , or natural deformity , but sharp of tongue , and
a Black of the deepest tint , &quot; Monsieur , if you were a man to be fought
with ! &quot; -- &quot; I am one , &quot; cries the young Duke de Castries . Fast as fire @-@ flash
Lameth replies , &quot; Tout a l &apos;heure , On the instant , then ! &quot; And so , as the
shades of dusk thicken in that Bois @-@ de @-@ Boulogne , we behold two men with
lion @-@ look , with alert attitude , side foremost , right foot advanced ;
flourishing and thrusting , stoccado and passado , in tierce and quart ;
intent to skewer one another . See , with most skewering purpose , headlong
Lameth , with his whole weight , makes a furious lunge ; but deft Castries
whisks aside : Lameth skewers only the air , -- and slits deep and far ,
on Castries &apos; sword &apos;s @-@ point , his own extended left arm ! Whereupon
with bleeding , pallor , surgeon &apos;s @-@ lint , and formalities , the Duel is
considered satisfactorily done .

But will there be no end , then ? Beloved Lameth lies deep @-@ slit , not out
of danger . Black traitorous Aristocrats kill the People &apos;s defenders , cut
up not with arguments , but with rapier @-@ slits . And the Twelve Spadassins
out of Switzerland , and the considerable number of Assassins exercising
at the pistol @-@ target ? So meditates and ejaculates hurt Patriotism , with
ever @-@ deepening ever @-@ widening fervour , for the space of six and thirty
hours .

The thirty @-@ six hours past , on Saturday the 13th , one beholds a
new spectacle : The Rue de Varennes , and neighbouring Boulevard des
Invalides , covered with a mixed flowing multitude : the Castries Hotel
gone distracted , devil @-@ ridden , belching from every window , &apos; beds with
clothes and curtains , &apos; plate of silver and gold with filigree , mirrors ,
pictures , images , commodes , chiffoniers , and endless crockery and
jingle : amid steady popular cheers , absolutely without theft ; for
there goes a cry , &quot; He shall be hanged that steals a nail ! &quot; It is a
Plebiscitum , or informal iconoclastic Decree of the Common People ,
in the course of being executed ! -- The Municipality sit tremulous ;
deliberating whether they will hang out the Drapeau Rouge and Martial
Law : National Assembly , part in loud wail , part in hardly suppressed
applause : Abbe Maury unable to decide whether the iconoclastic Plebs
amount to forty thousand or to two hundred thousand .

Deputations , swift messengers , for it is at a distance over the River ,
come and go . Lafayette and National Guardes , though without Drapeau
Rouge , get under way ; apparently in no hot haste . Nay , arrived on
the scene , Lafayette salutes with doffed hat , before ordering to fix
bayonets . What avails it ? The Plebeian &quot; Court of Cassation , &quot; as Camille
might punningly name it , has done its work ; steps forth , with unbuttoned
vest , with pockets turned inside out : sack , and just ravage ,
not plunder ! With inexhaustible patience , the Hero of two Worlds
remonstrates ; persuasively , with a kind of sweet constraint , though also
with fixed bayonets , dissipates , hushes down : on the morrow it is once
more all as usual .

Considering which things , however , Duke Castries may justly &apos; write to
the President , &apos; justly transport himself across the Marches ; to raise
a corps , or do what else is in him . Royalism totally abandons that
Bobadilian method of contest , and the Twelve Spadassins return to
Switzerland , -- or even to Dreamland through the Horn @-@ gate , whichsoever
their home is . Nay Editor Prudhomme is authorised to publish a curious
thing : &apos; We are authorised to publish , &apos; says he , dull @-@ blustering
Publisher , that M. Boyer , champion of good Patriots , is at the head
of Fifty Spadassinicides or Bully @-@ killers . His address is : Passage du
Bois @-@ de @-@ Boulonge , Faubourg St. Denis . &apos; ( Revolutions de Paris ( in Hist .
Parl. viii . 440 ) . ) One of the strangest Institutes , this of Champion
Boyer and the Bully @-@ killers ! Whose services , however , are not wanted ;
Royalism having abandoned the rapier @-@ method as plainly impracticable .



Chapter 2.3.IV.

To fly or not to fly .

The truth is Royalism sees itself verging towards sad extremities ;
nearer and nearer daily . From over the Rhine it comes asserted that the
King in his Tuileries is not free : this the poor King may contradict ,
with the official mouth , but in his heart feels often to be undeniable .
Civil Constitution of the Clergy ; Decree of ejectment against Dissidents
from it : not even to this latter , though almost his conscience rebels ,
can he say &apos; Nay ; but , after two months &apos; hesitating , signs this also . It
was on January 21st , &apos; of this 1790 , that he signed it ; to the sorrow
of his poor heart yet , on another Twenty @-@ first of January ! Whereby come
Dissident ejected Priests ; unconquerable Martyrs according to some ,
incurable chicaning Traitors according to others . And so there has
arrived what we once foreshadowed : with Religion , or with the Cant
and Echo of Religion , all France is rent asunder in a new rupture of
continuity ; complicating , embittering all the older ; -- to be cured only ,
by stern surgery , in La Vendee !

Unhappy Royalty , unhappy Majesty , Hereditary ( Representative ) ,
Representant Hereditaire , or however they can name him ; of whom much is
expected , to whom little is given ! Blue National Guards encircle
that Tuileries ; a Lafayette , thin constitutional Pedant ; clear , thin ,
inflexible , as water , turned to thin ice ; whom no Queen &apos;s heart can
love . National Assembly , its pavilion spread where we know , sits near
by , keeping continual hubbub . From without nothing but Nanci Revolts ,
sack of Castries Hotels , riots and seditions ; riots , North and South , at
Aix , at Douai , at Befort , Usez , Perpignan , at Nismes , and that incurable
Avignon of the Pope &apos;s : a continual crackling and sputtering of riots
from the whole face of France ; -- testifying how electric it grows . Add
only the hard winter , the famished strikes of operatives ; that continual
running @-@ bass of Scarcity , ground @-@ tone and basis of all other Discords !

The plan of Royalty , so far as it can be said to have any fixed plan , is
still , as ever , that of flying towards the frontiers . In very truth ,
the only plan of the smallest promise for it ! Fly to Bouille ; bristle
yourself round with cannon , served by your &apos; forty @-@ thousand undebauched
Germans : &apos; summon the National Assembly to follow you , summon what of it
is Royalist , Constitutional , gainable by money ; dissolve the rest , by
grapeshot if need be . Let Jacobinism and Revolt , with one wild wail , fly
into Infinite Space ; driven by grapeshot . Thunder over France with the
cannon &apos;s mouth ; commanding , not entreating , that this riot cease . And
then to rule afterwards with utmost possible Constitutionality ; doing
justice , loving mercy ; being Shepherd of this indigent People , not
Shearer merely , and Shepherd &apos;s @-@ similitude ! All this , if ye dare . If ye
dare not , then in Heaven &apos;s name go to sleep : other handsome alternative
seems none .

Nay , it were perhaps possible ; with a man to do it . For if such
inexpressible whirlpool of Babylonish confusions ( which our Era is )
cannot be stilled by man , but only by Time and men , a man may moderate
its paroxysms , may balance and sway , and keep himself unswallowed on the
top of it , -- as several men and Kings in these days do . Much is possible
for a man ; men will obey a man that kens and cans , and name him
reverently their Ken @-@ ning or King . Did not Charlemagne rule ? Consider
too whether he had smooth times of it ; hanging &apos; thirty @-@ thousand Saxons
over the Weser @-@ Bridge , &apos; at one dread swoop ! So likewise , who knows but ,
in this same distracted fanatic France , the right man may verily exist ?
An olive @-@ complexioned taciturn man ; for the present , Lieutenant in the
Artillery @-@ service , who once sat studying Mathematics at Brienne ? The
same who walked in the morning to correct proof @-@ sheets at Dole , and
enjoyed a frugal breakfast with M. Joly ? Such a one is gone , whither
also famed General Paoli his friend is gone , in these very days , to
see old scenes in native Corsica , and what Democratic good can be done
there .

Royalty never executes the evasion @-@ plan , yet never abandons it ; living
in variable hope ; undecisive , till fortune shall decide . In utmost
secresy , a brisk Correspondence goes on with Bouille ; there is also a
plot , which emerges more than once , for carrying the King to Rouen : ( See
Hist . Parl. vii . 316 ; Bertrand @-@ Moleville , &amp; c . ) plot after plot , emerging
and submerging , like &apos; ignes fatui in foul weather , which lead no
whither . About &apos; ten o &apos;clock at night , &apos; the Hereditary Representative , in
partie quarree , with the Queen , with Brother Monsieur , and Madame ,
sits playing &apos; wisk , &apos; or whist . Usher Campan enters mysteriously , with a
message he only half comprehends : How a certain Compte d &apos;Inisdal waits
anxious in the outer antechamber ; National Colonel , Captain of the watch
for this night , is gained over ; post @-@ horses ready all the way ; party of
Noblesse sitting armed , determined ; will His Majesty , before midnight ,
consent to go ? Profound silence ; Campan waiting with upturned ear . &quot; Did
your Majesty hear what Campan said ? &quot; asks the Queen . &quot; Yes , I heard , &quot;
answers Majesty , and plays on . &quot; &apos; Twas a pretty couplet , that of
Campan &apos;s , &quot; hints Monsieur , who at times showed a pleasant wit : Majesty ,
still unresponsive , plays wisk . &quot; After all , one must say something to
Campan , &quot; remarks the Queen . &quot; Tell M. d &apos;Inisdal , &quot; said the King , and the
Queen puts an emphasis on it , &quot; that the King cannot consent to be forced
away . &quot; -- &quot; I see ! &quot; said d &apos;Inisdal , whisking round , peaking himself into
flame of irritancy : &quot; we have the risk ; we are to have all the blame
if it fail , &quot; ( Campan , ii . 105 . ) -- and vanishes , he and his plot , as
will @-@ o &apos; -wisps do . The Queen sat till far in the night , packing
jewels : but it came to nothing ; in that peaked frame of irritancy the
Will @-@ o &apos; -wisp had gone out .

Little hope there is in all this . Alas , with whom to fly ? Our loyal
Gardes @-@ du @-@ Corps , ever since the Insurrection of Women , are disbanded ;
gone to their homes ; gone , many of them , across the Rhine towards
Coblentz and Exiled Princes : brave Miomandre and brave Tardivet , these
faithful Two , have received , in nocturnal interview with both Majesties ,
their viaticum of gold louis , of heartfelt thanks from a Queen &apos;s lips ,
though unluckily &apos; his Majesty stood , back to fire , not speaking ; &apos;
( Campan , ii . 109 @-@ 11 . ) and do now dine through the Provinces ; recounting
hairsbreadth escapes , insurrectionary horrors . Great horrors ; to be
swallowed yet of greater . But on the whole what a falling off from the
old splendour of Versailles ! Here in this poor Tuileries , a National
Brewer @-@ Colonel , sonorous Santerre , parades officially behind her
Majesty &apos;s chair . Our high dignitaries , all fled over the Rhine : nothing
now to be gained at Court ; but hopes , for which life itself must be
risked ! Obscure busy men frequent the back stairs ; with hearsays , wind
projects , un fruitful fanfaronades . Young Royalists , at the Theatre
de Vaudeville , &apos; sing couplets ; &apos; if that could do any thing . Royalists
enough , Captains on furlough , burnt @-@ out Seigneurs , may likewise be met
with , &apos; in the Cafe de Valois , and at Meot the Restaurateur &apos;s . &apos; There
they fan one another into high loyal glow ; drink , in such wine as can
be procured , confusion to Sansculottism ; shew purchased dirks , of
an improved structure , made to order ; and , greatly daring , dine .
( Dampmartin , ii . 129 . ) It is in these places , in these months , that the
epithet Sansculotte first gets applied to indigent Patriotism ; in
the last age we had Gilbert Sansculotte , the indigent Poet . ( Mercier ,
Nouveau Paris , iii . 204 . ) Destitute @-@ of @-@ Breeches : a mournful Destitution ;
which however , if Twenty millions share it , may become more effective
than most Possessions !

Meanwhile , amid this vague dim whirl of fanfaronades , wind @-@ projects ,
poniards made to order , there does disclose itself one punctum @-@ saliens
of life and feasibility : the finger of Mirabeau ! Mirabeau and the Queen
of France have met ; have parted with mutual trust ! It is strange ;
secret as the Mysteries ; but it is indubitable . Mirabeau took horse , one
evening ; and rode westward , unattended , -- to see Friend Claviere in that
country house of his ? Before getting to Claviere &apos;s , the much @-@ musing
horseman struck aside to a back gate of the Garden of Saint @-@ Cloud : some
Duke d &apos;Aremberg , or the like , was there to introduce him ; the Queen was
not far : on a &apos; round knoll , rond point , the highest of the Garden of
Saint @-@ Cloud , &apos; he beheld the Queen &apos;s face ; spake with her , alone , under
the void canopy of Night . What an interview ; fateful secret for us ,
after all searching ; like the colloquies of the gods ! ( Campan , ii .
c . 17 . ) She called him &apos; a Mirabeau : &apos; elsewhere we read that she &apos; was
charmed with him , &apos; the wild submitted Titan ; as indeed it is among
the honourable tokens of this high ill @-@ fated heart that no mind of any
endowment , no Mirabeau , nay no Barnave , no Dumouriez , ever came face
to face with her but , in spite of all prepossessions , she was forced to
recognise it , to draw nigh to it , with trust . High imperial heart ; with
the instinctive attraction towards all that had any height ! &quot; You know
not the Queen , &quot; said Mirabeau once in confidence ; &quot; her force of mind is
prodigious ; she is a man for courage . &quot; ( Dumont , p . 211 . ) -- And so ,
under the void Night , on the crown of that knoll , she has spoken with
a Mirabeau : he has kissed loyally the queenly hand , and said with
enthusiasm : &quot; Madame , the Monarchy is saved ! &quot; -- Possible ? The Foreign
Powers , mysteriously sounded , gave favourable guarded response ;
( Correspondence Secrete ( in Hist . Parl. viii . 169 @-@ 73 ) . ) Bouille is at
Metz , and could find forty @-@ thousand sure Germans . With a Mirabeau for
head , and a Bouille for hand , something verily is possible , -- if Fate
intervene not .

But figure under what thousandfold wrappages , and cloaks of darkness ,
Royalty , meditating these things , must involve itself . There are men
with &apos; Tickets of Entrance ; &apos; there are chivalrous consultings , mysterious
plottings . Consider also whether , involve as it like , plotting Royalty
can escape the glance of Patriotism ; lynx @-@ eyes , by the ten thousand
fixed on it , which see in the dark ! Patriotism knows much : know the
dirks made to order , and can specify the shops ; knows Sieur Motier &apos;s
legions of mouchards ; the Tickets of Entree , and men in black ; and how
plan of evasion succeeds plan , -- or may be supposed to succeed it . Then
conceive the couplets chanted at the Theatre de Vaudeville ; or worse ,
the whispers , significant nods of traitors in moustaches . Conceive ,
on the other hand , the loud cry of alarm that came through the
Hundred @-@ and @-@ Thirty Journals ; the Dionysius &apos; -Ear of each of the
Forty @-@ eight Sections , wakeful night and day .

Patriotism is patient of much ; not patient of all . The Cafe de Procope
has sent , visibly along the streets , a Deputation of Patriots , &apos; to
expostulate with bad Editors , &apos; by trustful word of mouth : singular to
see and hear . The bad Editors promise to amend , but do not . Deputations
for change of Ministry were many ; Mayor Bailly joining even with
Cordelier Danton in such : and they have prevailed . With what profit ? Of
Quacks , willing or constrained to be Quacks , the race is everlasting :
Ministers Duportail and Dutertre will have to manage much as Ministers
Latour @-@ du @-@ Pin and Cice did . So welters the confused world .

But now , beaten on for ever by such inextricable contradictory
influences and evidences , what is the indigent French Patriot , in these
unhappy days , to believe , and walk by ? Uncertainty all ; except that he
is wretched , indigent ; that a glorious Revolution , the wonder of the
Universe , has hitherto brought neither Bread nor Peace ; being marred
by traitors , difficult to discover . Traitors that dwell in the dark ,
invisible there ; -- or seen for moments , in pallid dubious twilight ,
stealthily vanishing thither ! Preternatural Suspicion once more rules
the minds of men .

&apos;Nobody here , &apos; writes Carra of the Annales Patriotiques , so early as
the first of February , &apos; can entertain a doubt of the constant obstinate
project these people have on foot to get the King away ; or of the
perpetual succession of manoeuvres they employ for that . &apos; Nobody : the
watchful Mother of Patriotism deputed two Members to her Daughter at
Versailles , to examine how the matter looked there . Well , and there ?
Patriotic Carra continues : &apos; The Report of these two deputies we
all heard with our own ears last Saturday . They went with others of
Versailles , to inspect the King &apos;s Stables , also the stables of the
whilom Gardes du Corps ; they found there from seven to eight hundred
horses standing always saddled and bridled , ready for the road at a
moment &apos;s notice . The same deputies , moreover , saw with their own two
eyes several Royal Carriages , which men were even then busy loading with
large well @-@ stuffed luggage @-@ bags , &apos; leather cows , as we call them ,
&apos;vaches de cuir ; the Royal Arms on the panels almost entirely effaced . &apos; 
Momentous enough ! Also , &apos; on the same day the whole Marechaussee , or
Cavalry Police , did assemble with arms , horses and baggage , &apos; -- and
disperse again . They want the King over the marches , that so Emperor
Leopold and the German Princes , whose troops are ready , may have a
pretext for beginning : &apos; this , &apos; adds Carra , &apos; is the word of the riddle :
this is the reason why our fugitive Aristocrats are now making levies
of men on the frontiers ; expecting that , one of these mornings , the
Executive Chief Magistrate will be brought over to them , and the civil
war commence . &apos; ( Carra &apos;s Newspaper , 1st Feb. 1791 ( in Hist . Parl. ix .
39 ) . )

If indeed the Executive Chief Magistrate , bagged , say in one of these
leather cows , were once brought safe over to them ! But the strangest
thing of all is that Patriotism , whether barking at a venture , or guided
by some instinct of preternatural sagacity , is actually barking
aright this time ; at something , not at nothing . Bouille &apos;s Secret
Correspondence , since made public , testifies as much .

Nay , it is undeniable , visible to all , that Mesdames the King &apos;s Aunts
are taking steps for departure : asking passports of the Ministry ,
safe @-@ conducts of the Municipality ; which Marat warns all men to beware
of . They will carry gold with them , &apos; these old Beguines ; &apos; nay they will
carry the little Dauphin , &apos; having nursed a changeling , for some time , to
leave in his stead ! &apos; Besides , they are as some light substance flung up ,
to shew how the wind sits ; a kind of proof @-@ kite you fly off to ascertain
whether the grand paper @-@ kite , Evasion of the King , may mount !

In these alarming circumstances , Patriotism is not wanting to itself .
Municipality deputes to the King ; Sections depute to the Municipality ;
a National Assembly will soon stir . Meanwhile , behold , on the 19th
of February 1791 , Mesdames , quitting Bellevue and Versailles with all
privacy , are off ! Towards Rome , seemingly ; or one knows not whither .
They are not without King &apos;s passports , countersigned ; and what is more
to the purpose , a serviceable Escort . The Patriotic Mayor or Mayorlet of
the Village of Moret tried to detain them ; but brisk Louis de Narbonne ,
of the Escort , dashed off at hand @-@ gallop ; returned soon with thirty
dragoons , and victoriously cut them out . And so the poor ancient
women go their way ; to the terror of France and Paris , whose nervous
excitability is become extreme . Who else would hinder poor Loque
and Graille , now grown so old , and fallen into such unexpected
circumstances , when gossip itself turning only on terrors and horrors
is no longer pleasant to the mind , and you cannot get so much as an
orthodox confessor in peace , -- from going what way soever the hope of any
solacement might lead them ?

They go , poor ancient dames , -- whom the heart were hard that does
not pity : they go ; with palpitations , with unmelodious suppressed
screechings ; all France , screeching and cackling , in loud unsuppressed
terror , behind and on both hands of them : such mutual suspicion is
among men . At Arnay le Duc , above halfway to the frontiers , a Patriotic
Municipality and Populace again takes courage to stop them : Louis
Narbonne must now back to Paris , must consult the National Assembly .
National Assembly answers , not without an effort , that Mesdames may
go . Whereupon Paris rises worse than ever , screeching half @-@ distracted .
Tuileries and precincts are filled with women and men , while the
National Assembly debates this question of questions ; Lafayette
is needed at night for dispersing them , and the streets are to be
illuminated . Commandant Berthier , a Berthier before whom are great
things unknown , lies for the present under blockade at Bellevue in
Versailles . By no tactics could he get Mesdames &apos; Luggage stirred from
the Courts there ; frantic Versaillese women came screaming about him ;
his very troops cut the waggon @-@ traces ; he retired to the interior ,
waiting better times . ( Campan , ii . 132 . )

Nay , in these same hours , while Mesdames hardly cut out from Moret by
the sabre &apos;s edge , are driving rapidly , to foreign parts , and not yet
stopped at Arnay , their august nephew poor Monsieur , at Paris has dived
deep into his cellars of the Luxembourg for shelter ; and according to
Montgaillard can hardly be persuaded up again . Screeching multitudes
environ that Luxembourg of his : drawn thither by report of his
departure : but , at sight and sound of Monsieur , they become crowing
multitudes ; and escort Madame and him to the Tuileries with vivats .
( Montgaillard , ii . 282 ; Deux Amis , vi. c . 1 . ) It is a state of nervous
excitability such as few Nations know .



Chapter 2.3.V.

The Day of Poniards .

Or , again , what means this visible reparation of the Castle of
Vincennes ? Other Jails being all crowded with prisoners , new space is
wanted here : that is the Municipal account . For in such changing of
Judicatures , Parlements being abolished , and New Courts but just set up ,
prisoners have accumulated . Not to say that in these times of discord
and club @-@ law , offences and committals are , at any rate , more numerous .
Which Municipal account , does it not sufficiently explain the
phenomenon ? Surely , to repair the Castle of Vincennes was of all
enterprises that an enlightened Municipality could undertake , the most
innocent .

Not so however does neighbouring Saint @-@ Antoine look on it : Saint @-@ Antoine
to whom these peaked turrets and grim donjons , all @-@ too near her own
dark dwelling , are of themselves an offence . Was not Vincennes a kind of
minor Bastille ? Great Diderot and Philosophes have lain in durance here ;
great Mirabeau , in disastrous eclipse , for forty @-@ two months . And now
when the old Bastille has become a dancing @-@ ground ( had any one the mirth
to dance ) , and its stones are getting built into the Pont Louis @-@ Seize ,
does this minor , comparative insignificance of a Bastille flank
itself with fresh @-@ hewn mullions , spread out tyrannous wings ; menacing
Patriotism ? New space for prisoners : and what prisoners ? A d &apos;Orleans ,
with the chief Patriots on the tip of the Left ? It is said , there runs
&apos;a subterranean passage &apos; all the way from the Tuileries hither . Who
knows ? Paris , mined with quarries and catacombs , does hang wondrous over
the abyss ; Paris was once to be blown up , -- though the powder , when
we went to look , had got withdrawn . A Tuileries , sold to Austria and
Coblentz , should have no subterranean passage . Out of which might not
Coblentz or Austria issue , some morning ; and , with cannon of long range ,
&apos;foudroyer , &apos; bethunder a patriotic Saint @-@ Antoine into smoulder and ruin !

So meditates the benighted soul of Saint @-@ Antoine , as it sees the aproned
workmen , in early spring , busy on these towers . An official @-@ speaking
Municipality , a Sieur Motier with his legions of mouchards , deserve no
trust at all . Were Patriot Santerre , indeed , Commander ! But the sonorous
Brewer commands only our own Battalion : of such secrets he can explain
nothing , knows nothing , perhaps suspects much . And so the work goes
on ; and afflicted benighted Saint @-@ Antoine hears rattle of hammers , sees
stones suspended in air . ( Montgaillard , ii . 285 . )

Saint @-@ Antoine prostrated the first great Bastille : will it falter over
this comparative insignificance of a Bastille ? Friends , what if we took
pikes , firelocks , sledgehammers ; and helped ourselves ! -- Speedier is no
remedy ; nor so certain . On the 28th day of February , Saint @-@ Antoine turns
out , as it has now often done ; and , apparently with little superfluous
tumult , moves eastward to that eye @-@ sorrow of Vincennes . With grave voice
of authority , no need of bullying and shouting , Saint @-@ Antoine signifies
to parties concerned there that its purpose is , To have this
suspicious Stronghold razed level with the general soil of the country .
Remonstrance may be proffered , with zeal : but it avails not . The outer
gate goes up , drawbridges tumble ; iron window @-@ stanchions , smitten
out with sledgehammers , become iron @-@ crowbars : it rains furniture ,
stone @-@ masses , slates : with chaotic clatter and rattle , Demolition
clatters down . And now hasty expresses rush through the agitated
streets , to warn Lafayette , and the Municipal and Departmental
Authorities ; Rumour warns a National Assembly , a Royal Tuileries , and
all men who care to hear it : That Saint @-@ Antoine is up ; that Vincennes ,
and probably the last remaining Institution of the Country , is coming
down . ( Deux Amis , vi . 11 @-@ 15 ; Newspapers ( in Hist . Parl. ix . 111 @-@ 17 ) . )

Quick , then ! Let Lafayette roll his drums and fly eastward ; for to all
Constitutional Patriots this is again bad news . And you , ye Friends of
Royalty , snatch your poniards of improved structure , made to order ; your
sword @-@ canes , secret arms , and tickets of entry ; quick , by backstairs
passages , rally round the Son of Sixty Kings . An effervescence probably
got up by d &apos;Orleans and Company , for the overthrow of Throne and Altar :
it is said her Majesty shall be put in prison , put out of the way ; what
then will his Majesty be ? Clay for the Sansculottic Potter ! Or were
it impossible to fly this day ; a brave Noblesse suddenly all rallying ?
Peril threatens , hope invites : Dukes de Villequier , de Duras , Gentlemen
of the Chamber give tickets and admittance ; a brave Noblesse is suddenly
all rallying . Now were the time to &apos; fall sword in hand on those gentry
there , &apos; could it be done with effect .

The Hero of two Worlds is on his white charger ; blue Nationals , horse
and foot , hurrying eastward : Santerre , with the Saint @-@ Antoine Battalion ,
is already there , -- apparently indisposed to act . Heavy @-@ laden Hero of two
Worlds , what tasks are these ! The jeerings , provocative gambollings of
that Patriot Suburb , which is all out on the streets now , are hard to
endure ; unwashed Patriots jeering in sulky sport ; one unwashed Patriot
&apos;seizing the General by the boot &apos; to unhorse him . Santerre , ordered
to fire , makes answer obliquely , &quot; These are the men that took the
Bastille ; &quot; and not a trigger stirs ! Neither dare the Vincennes
Magistracy give warrant of arrestment , or the smallest countenance :
wherefore the General &apos; will take it on himself &apos; to arrest . By
promptitude , by cheerful adroitness , patience and brisk valour without
limits , the riot may be again bloodlessly appeased .

Meanwhile , the rest of Paris , with more or less unconcern , may mind the
rest of its business : for what is this but an effervescence , of which
there are now so many ? The National Assembly , in one of its stormiest
moods , is debating a Law against Emigration ; Mirabeau declaring aloud ,
&quot; I swear beforehand that I will not obey it . &quot; Mirabeau is often at the
Tribune this day ; with endless impediments from without ; with the old
unabated energy from within . What can murmurs and clamours , from Left
or from Right , do to this man ; like Teneriffe or Atlas unremoved ? With
clear thought ; with strong bass @-@ voice , though at first low , uncertain ,
he claims audience , sways the storm of men : anon the sound of him waxes ,
softens ; he rises into far @-@ sounding melody of strength , triumphant ,
which subdues all hearts ; his rude @-@ seamed face , desolate fire @-@ scathed ,
becomes fire @-@ lit , and radiates : once again men feel , in these beggarly
ages , what is the potency and omnipotency of man &apos;s word on the souls of
men . &quot; I will triumph or be torn in fragments , &quot; he was once heard to
say . &quot; Silence , &quot; he cries now , in strong word of command , in imperial
consciousness of strength , &quot; Silence , the thirty voices , Silence
aux trente voix ! &quot; -- and Robespierre and the Thirty Voices die into
mutterings ; and the Law is once more as Mirabeau would have it .

How different , at the same instant , is General Lafayette &apos;s street
eloquence ; wrangling with sonorous Brewers , with an ungrammatical
Saint @-@ Antoine ! Most different , again , from both is the Cafe @-@ de @-@ Valois
eloquence , and suppressed fanfaronade , of this multitude of men with
Tickets of Entry ; who are now inundating the Corridors of the Tuileries .
Such things can go on simultaneously in one City . How much more in
one Country ; in one Planet with its discrepancies , every Day a mere
crackling infinitude of discrepancies -- which nevertheless do yield some
coherent net @-@ product , though an infinitesimally small one !

Be this as it may . Lafayette has saved Vincennes ; and is marching
homewards with some dozen of arrested demolitionists . Royalty is not
yet saved ; -- nor indeed specially endangered . But to the King &apos;s
Constitutional Guard , to these old Gardes Francaises , or Centre
Grenadiers , as it chanced to be , this affluence of men with Tickets of
Entry is becoming more and more unintelligible . Is his Majesty verily
for Metz , then ; to be carried off by these men , on the spur of the
instant ? That revolt of Saint @-@ Antoine got up by traitor Royalists for a
stalking @-@ horse ? Keep a sharp outlook , ye Centre Grenadiers on duty
here : good never came from the &apos; men in black . &apos; Nay they have cloaks ,
redingotes ; some of them leather @-@ breeches , boots , -- as if for instant
riding ! Or what is this that sticks visible from the lapelle of
Chevalier de Court ? ( Weber , ii . 286 . ) Too like the handle of some
cutting or stabbing instrument ! He glides and goes ; and still the
dudgeon sticks from his left lapelle . &quot; Hold , Monsieur ! &quot; -- a Centre
Grenadier clutches him ; clutches the protrusive dudgeon , whisks it out
in the face of the world : by Heaven , a very dagger ; hunting @-@ knife , or
whatsoever you call it ; fit to drink the life of Patriotism !

So fared it with Chevalier de Court , early in the day ; not without
noise ; not without commentaries . And now this continually increasing
multitude at nightfall ? Have they daggers too ? Alas , with them too ,
after angry parleyings , there has begun a groping and a rummaging ;
all men in black , spite of their Tickets of Entry , are clutched by the
collar , and groped . Scandalous to think of ; for always , as the dirk ,
sword @-@ cane , pistol , or were it but tailor &apos;s bodkin , is found on him , and
with loud scorn drawn forth from him , he , the hapless man in black , is
flung all too rapidly down stairs . Flung ; and ignominiously descends ,
head foremost ; accelerated by ignominious shovings from sentry after
sentry ; nay , as is written , by smitings , twitchings , -- spurnings , a
posteriori , not to be named . In this accelerated way , emerges , uncertain
which end uppermost , man after man in black , through all issues , into
the Tuileries Garden . Emerges , alas , into the arms of an indignant
multitude , now gathered and gathering there , in the hour of dusk , to see
what is toward , and whether the Hereditary Representative is carried
off or not . Hapless men in black ; at last convicted of poniards made to
order ; convicted &apos; Chevaliers of the Poniard ! &apos; Within is as the burning
ship ; without is as the deep sea . Within is no help ; his Majesty ,
looking forth , one moment , from his interior sanctuaries , coldly bids
all visitors &apos; give up their weapons ; &apos; and shuts the door again . The
weapons given up form a heap : the convicted Chevaliers of the poniard
keep descending pellmell , with impetuous velocity ; and at the bottom
of all staircases , the mixed multitude receives them , hustles , buffets ,
chases and disperses them . ( Hist . Parl. ix . 139 @-@ 48 . )

Such sight meets Lafayette , in the dusk of the evening , as he returns ,
successful with difficulty at Vincennes : Sansculotte Scylla hardly
weathered , here is Aristocrat Charybdis gurgling under his lee ! The
patient Hero of two Worlds almost loses temper . He accelerates , does
not retard , the flying Chevaliers ; delivers , indeed , this or the other
hunted Loyalist of quality , but rates him in bitter words , such as
the hour suggested ; such as no saloon could pardon . Hero ill @-@ bested ;
hanging , so to speak , in mid @-@ air ; hateful to Rich divinities above ;
hateful to Indigent mortals below ! Duke de Villequier , Gentleman of the
Chamber , gets such contumelious rating , in presence of all people there ,
that he may see good first to exculpate himself in the Newspapers ; then ,
that not prospering , to retire over the Frontiers , and begin plotting
at Brussels . ( Montgaillard , ii . 286 . ) His Apartment will stand vacant ;
usefuller , as we may find , than when it stood occupied .

So fly the Chevaliers of the Poniard ; hunted of Patriotic men ,
shamefully in the thickening dusk . A dim miserable business ; born of
darkness ; dying away there in the thickening dusk and dimness ! In the
midst of which , however , let the reader discern clearly one figure
running for its life : Crispin @-@ Cataline d &apos;Espremenil , -- for the last time ,
or the last but one . It is not yet three years since these same Centre
Grenadiers , Gardes Francaises then , marched him towards the Calypso
Isles , in the gray of the May morning ; and he and they have got thus
far . Buffeted , beaten down , delivered by popular Petion , he might well
answer bitterly : &quot; And I too , Monsieur , have been carried on the People &apos;s
shoulders . &quot; ( See Mercier , ii . 40 , 202 . ) A fact which popular Petion , if
he like , can meditate .

But happily , one way and another , the speedy night covers up this
ignominious Day of Poniards ; and the Chevaliers escape , though
maltreated , with torn coat @-@ skirts and heavy hearts , to their respective
dwelling @-@ houses . Riot twofold is quelled ; and little blood shed , if it
be not insignificant blood from the nose : Vincennes stands undemolished ,
reparable ; and the Hereditary Representative has not been stolen , nor
the Queen smuggled into Prison . A Day long remembered : commented on with
loud hahas and deep grumblings ; with bitter scornfulness of triumph ,
bitter rancour of defeat . Royalism , as usual , imputes it to d &apos;Orleans
and the Anarchists intent on insulting Majesty : Patriotism , as usual ,
to Royalists , and even Constitutionalists , intent on stealing Majesty to
Metz : we , also as usual , to Preternatural Suspicion , and Phoebus Apollo
having made himself like the Night .

Thus however has the reader seen , in an unexpected arena , on this last
day of February 1791 , the Three long @-@ contending elements of French
Society , dashed forth into singular comico @-@ tragical collision ; acting
and reacting openly to the eye . Constitutionalism , at once quelling
Sansculottic riot at Vincennes , and Royalist treachery from the
Tuileries , is great , this day , and prevails . As for poor Royalism ,
tossed to and fro in that manner , its daggers all left in a heap , what
can one think of it ? Every dog , the Adage says , has its day : has it ; has
had it ; or will have it . For the present , the day is Lafayette &apos;s and
the Constitution &apos;s . Nevertheless Hunger and Jacobinism , fast growing
fanatical , still work ; their @-@ day , were they once fanatical , will come .
Hitherto , in all tempests , Lafayette , like some divine Sea @-@ ruler , raises
his serene head : the upper Aeolus &apos;s blasts fly back to their caves , like
foolish unbidden winds : the under sea @-@ billows they had vexed into froth
allay themselves . But if , as we often write , the submarine Titanic
Fire @-@ powers came into play , the Ocean bed from beneath being burst ? If
they hurled Poseidon Lafayette and his Constitution out of Space ; and ,
in the Titanic melee , sea were mixed with sky ?



Chapter 2.3.VI.

Mirabeau .

The spirit of France waxes ever more acrid , fever @-@ sick : towards the
final outburst of dissolution and delirium . Suspicion rules all minds :
contending parties cannot now commingle ; stand separated sheer asunder ,
eying one another , in most aguish mood , of cold terror or hot rage .
Counter @-@ Revolution , Days of Poniards , Castries Duels ; Flight of
Mesdames , of Monsieur and Royalty ! Journalism shrills ever louder its
cry of alarm . The sleepless Dionysius &apos;s Ear of the Forty @-@ eight Sections ,
how feverishly quick has it grown ; convulsing with strange pangs the
whole sick Body , as in such sleeplessness and sickness , the ear will do !

Since Royalists get Poniards made to order , and a Sieur Motier is no
better than he should be , shall not Patriotism too , even of the indigent
sort , have Pikes , secondhand Firelocks , in readiness for the worst ?
The anvils ring , during this March month , with hammering of Pikes . A
Constitutional Municipality promulgated its Placard , that no citizen
except the &apos; active or cash @-@ citizen &apos; was entitled to have arms ; but there
rose , instantly responsive , such a tempest of astonishment from Club and
Section , that the Constitutional Placard , almost next morning , had
to cover itself up , and die away into inanity , in a second improved
edition . ( Ordonnance du 17 Mars 1791 ( Hist . Parl. ix . 257 ) . ) So the
hammering continues ; as all that it betokens does .

Mark , again , how the extreme tip of the Left is mounting in favour ,
if not in its own National Hall , yet with the Nation , especially with
Paris . For in such universal panic of doubt , the opinion that is sure of
itself , as the meagrest opinion may the soonest be , is the one to which
all men will rally . Great is Belief , were it never so meagre ; and leads
captive the doubting heart ! Incorruptible Robespierre has been elected
Public Accuser in our new Courts of Judicature ; virtuous Petion , it
is thought , may rise to be Mayor . Cordelier Danton , called also by
triumphant majorities , sits at the Departmental Council @-@ table ; colleague
there of Mirabeau . Of incorruptible Robespierre it was long ago
predicted that he might go far , mean meagre mortal though he was ; for
Doubt dwelt not in him .

Under which circumstances ought not Royalty likewise to cease doubting ,
and begin deciding and acting ? Royalty has always that sure trump @-@ card
in its hand : Flight out of Paris . Which sure trump @-@ card , Royalty , as we
see , keeps ever and anon clutching at , grasping ; and swashes it forth
tentatively ; yet never tables it , still puts it back again . Play it , O
Royalty ! If there be a chance left , this seems it , and verily the last
chance ; and now every hour is rendering this a doubtfuller . Alas , one
would so fain both fly and not fly ; play one &apos;s card and have it to play .
Royalty , in all human likelihood , will not play its trump @-@ card till the
honours , one after one , be mainly lost ; and such trumping of it prove to
be the sudden finish of the game !

Here accordingly a question always arises ; of the prophetic sort ; which
cannot now be answered . Suppose Mirabeau , with whom Royalty takes deep
counsel , as with a Prime Minister that cannot yet legally avow himself
as such , had got his arrangements completed ? Arrangements he has ;
far @-@ stretching plans that dawn fitfully on us , by fragments , in the
confused darkness . Thirty Departments ready to sign loyal Addresses , of
prescribed tenor : King carried out of Paris , but only to Compiegne and
Rouen , hardly to Metz , since , once for all , no Emigrant rabble shall
take the lead in it : National Assembly consenting , by dint of loyal
Addresses , by management , by force of Bouille , to hear reason , and
follow thither ! ( See Fils Adoptif , vii . 1 . 6 ; Dumont , c . 11 , 12 , 14 . )
Was it so , on these terms , that Jacobinism and Mirabeau were then to
grapple , in their Hercules @-@ and @-@ Typhon duel ; death inevitable for the one
or the other ? The duel itself is determined on , and sure : but on
what terms ; much more , with what issue , we in vain guess . It is vague
darkness all : unknown what is to be ; unknown even what has already been .
The giant Mirabeau walks in darkness , as we said ; companionless , on
wild ways : what his thoughts during these months were , no record of
Biographer , not vague Fils Adoptif , will now ever disclose .

To us , endeavouring to cast his horoscope , it of course remains doubly
vague . There is one Herculean man , in internecine duel with him , there
is Monster after Monster . Emigrant Noblesse return , sword on thigh ,
vaunting of their Loyalty never sullied ; descending from the air , like
Harpy @-@ swarms with ferocity , with obscene greed . Earthward there is the
Typhon of Anarchy , Political , Religious ; sprawling hundred @-@ headed , say
with Twenty @-@ five million heads ; wide as the area of France ; fierce as
Frenzy ; strong in very Hunger . With these shall the Serpent @-@ queller do
battle continually , and expect no rest .

As for the King , he as usual will go wavering chameleonlike ; changing
colour and purpose with the colour of his environment ; -- good for no
Kingly use . On one royal person , on the Queen only , can Mirabeau
perhaps place dependance . It is possible , the greatness of this man , not
unskilled too in blandishments , courtiership , and graceful adroitness ,
might , with most legitimate sorcery , fascinate the volatile Queen ,
and fix her to him . She has courage for all noble daring ; an eye and a
heart : the soul of Theresa &apos;s Daughter . &apos; Faut il @-@ donc , Is it fated then , &apos;
she passionately writes to her Brother , &apos; that I with the blood I am come
of , with the sentiments I have , must live and die among such mortals ? &apos;
( Fils Adoptif , ubi supra . ) Alas , poor Princess , Yes . &apos; She is the only
man , &apos; as Mirabeau observes , &apos; whom his Majesty has about him . &apos; Of one
other man Mirabeau is still surer : of himself . There lies his resources ;
sufficient or insufficient .

Dim and great to the eye of Prophecy looks the future ! A perpetual
life @-@ and @-@ death battle ; confusion from above and from below ; -- mere
confused darkness for us ; with here and there some streak of faint lurid
light . We see King perhaps laid aside ; not tonsured , tonsuring is out
of fashion now ; but say , sent away any whither , with handsome annual
allowance , and stock of smith @-@ tools . We see a Queen and Dauphin , Regent
and Minor ; a Queen &apos; mounted on horseback , &apos; in the din of battles , with
Moriamur pro rege nostro ! &apos; Such a day , &apos; Mirabeau writes , &apos; may come . &apos; 

Din of battles , wars more than civil , confusion from above and from
below : in such environment the eye of Prophecy sees Comte de Mirabeau ,
like some Cardinal de Retz , stormfully maintain himself ; with head
all @-@ devising , heart all @-@ daring , if not victorious , yet unvanquished ,
while life is left him . The specialties and issues of it , no eye of
Prophecy can guess at : it is clouds , we repeat , and tempestuous night ;
and in the middle of it , now visible , far darting , now labouring in
eclipse , is Mirabeau indomitably struggling to be Cloud @-@ Compeller ! -- One
can say that , had Mirabeau lived , the History of France and of the World
had been different . Further , that the man would have needed , as few men
ever did , the whole compass of that same &apos; Art of Daring , Art d &apos;Oser , &apos;
which he so prized ; and likewise that he , above all men then
living , would have practised and manifested it . Finally , that some
substantiality , and no empty simulacrum of a formula , would have been
the result realised by him : a result you could have loved , a result
you could have hated ; by no likelihood , a result you could only have
rejected with closed lips , and swept into quick forgetfulness for ever .
Had Mirabeau lived one other year !



Chapter 2.3.VII.

Death of Mirabeau .

But Mirabeau could not live another year , any more than he could live
another thousand years . Men &apos;s years are numbered , and the tale of
Mirabeau &apos;s was now complete . Important , or unimportant ; to be mentioned
in World @-@ History for some centuries , or not to be mentioned there beyond
a day or two , -- it matters not to peremptory Fate . From amid the press
of ruddy busy Life , the Pale Messenger beckons silently : wide @-@ spreading
interests , projects , salvation of French Monarchies , what thing soever
man has on hand , he must suddenly quit it all , and go . Wert thou saving
French Monarchies ; wert thou blacking shoes on the Pont Neuf ! The most
important of men cannot stay ; did the World &apos;s History depend on an hour ,
that hour is not to be given . Whereby , indeed , it comes that these same
would @-@ have @-@ beens are mostly a vanity ; and the World &apos;s History could
never in the least be what it would , or might , or should , by any manner
of potentiality , but simply and altogether what it is .

The fierce wear and tear of such an existence has wasted out the giant
oaken strength of Mirabeau . A fret and fever that keeps heart and brain
on fire : excess of effort , of excitement ; excess of all kinds : labour
incessant , almost beyond credibility ! &apos; If I had not lived with him , &apos;
says Dumont , &apos; I should never have known what a man can make of one day ;
what things may be placed within the interval of twelve hours . A day
for this man was more than a week or a month is for others : the mass of
things he guided on together was prodigious ; from the scheming to the
executing not a moment lost . &apos; &quot; Monsieur le Comte , &quot; said his Secretary to
him once , &quot; what you require is impossible . &quot; -- &quot; Impossible ! &quot; answered he
starting from his chair , &quot; Ne me dites jamais ce bete de mot , Never name
to me that blockhead of a word . &quot; ( Dumont , p . 311 . ) And then the social
repasts ; the dinner which he gives as Commandant of National Guards ,
which &apos; costs five hundred pounds ; &apos; alas , and &apos; the Sirens of the Opera ; &apos;
and all the ginger that is hot in the mouth : -- down what a course is this
man hurled ! Cannot Mirabeau stop ; cannot he fly , and save himself alive ?
No ! There is a Nessus &apos; Shirt on this Hercules ; he must storm and burn
there , without rest , till he be consumed . Human strength , never
so Herculean , has its measure . Herald shadows flit pale across the
fire @-@ brain of Mirabeau ; heralds of the pale repose . While he tosses and
storms , straining every nerve , in that sea of ambition and confusion ,
there comes , sombre and still , a monition that for him the issue of it
will be swift death .

In January last , you might see him as President of the Assembly ; &apos; his
neck wrapt in linen cloths , at the evening session : &apos; there was sick heat
of the blood , alternate darkening and flashing in the eye @-@ sight ; he had
to apply leeches , after the morning labour , and preside bandaged . &apos; At
parting he embraced me , &apos; says Dumont , &apos; with an emotion I had never seen
in him : &quot; I am dying , my friend ; dying as by slow fire ; we shall perhaps
not meet again . When I am gone , they will know what the value of me was .
The miseries I have held back will burst from all sides on France . &quot; &apos;
( Dumont , p . 267 . ) Sickness gives louder warning ; but cannot be listened
to . On the 27th day of March , proceeding towards the Assembly , he had to
seek rest and help in Friend de Lamarck &apos;s , by the road ; and lay
there , for an hour , half @-@ fainted , stretched on a sofa . To the Assembly
nevertheless he went , as if in spite of Destiny itself ; spoke , loud and
eager , five several times ; then quitted the Tribune -- for ever . He steps
out , utterly exhausted , into the Tuileries Gardens ; many people press
round him , as usual , with applications , memorials ; he says to the Friend
who was with him : Take me out of this !

And so , on the last day of March 1791 , endless anxious multitudes beset
the Rue de la Chaussee d &apos;Antin ; incessantly inquiring : within doors
there , in that House numbered in our time &apos; 42 , &apos; the over wearied giant
has fallen down , to die . ( Fils Adoptif , viii . 420 @-@ 79 . ) Crowds , of all
parties and kinds ; of all ranks from the King to the meanest man ! The
King sends publicly twice a @-@ day to inquire ; privately besides : from
the world at large there is no end of inquiring . &apos; A written bulletin is
handed out every three hours , &apos; is copied and circulated ; in the end ,
it is printed . The People spontaneously keep silence ; no carriage shall
enter with its noise : there is crowding pressure ; but the Sister of
Mirabeau is reverently recognised , and has free way made for her .
The People stand mute , heart @-@ stricken ; to all it seems as if a great
calamity were nigh : as if the last man of France , who could have swayed
these coming troubles , lay there at hand @-@ grips with the unearthly Power .

The silence of a whole People , the wakeful toil of Cabanis , Friend and
Physician , skills not : on Saturday , the second day of April , Mirabeau
feels that the last of the Days has risen for him ; that , on this day ,
he has to depart and be no more . His death is Titanic , as his life has
been . Lit up , for the last time , in the glare of coming dissolution , the
mind of the man is all glowing and burning ; utters itself in sayings ,
such as men long remember . He longs to live , yet acquiesces in death ,
argues not with the inexorable . His speech is wild and wondrous :
unearthly Phantasms dancing now their torch @-@ dance round his soul ; the
soul itself looking out , fire @-@ radiant , motionless , girt together for
that great hour ! At times comes a beam of light from him on the world
he is quitting . &quot; I carry in my heart the death @-@ dirge of the French
Monarchy ; the dead remains of it will now be the spoil of the factious . &quot;
Or again , when he heard the cannon fire , what is characteristic too :
&quot; Have we the Achilles &apos; Funeral already ? &quot; So likewise , while some friend
is supporting him : &quot; Yes , support that head ; would I could bequeath it
thee ! &quot; For the man dies as he has lived ; self @-@ conscious , conscious of a
world looking on . He gazes forth on the young Spring , which for him will
never be Summer . The Sun has risen ; he says : &quot; Si ce n &apos;est pas la Dieu ,
c &apos;est du moins son cousin germain . &quot; ( Fils Adoptif , viii . 450 ; Journal
de la maladie et de la mort de Mirabeau , par P.J.G. Cabanis ( Paris ,
1803 ) . ) -- Death has mastered the outworks ; power of speech is gone ;
the citadel of the heart still holding out : the moribund giant ,
passionately , by sign , demands paper and pen ; writes his passionate
demand for opium , to end these agonies . The sorrowful Doctor shakes his
head : Dormir &apos; To sleep , &apos; writes the other , passionately pointing at it !
So dies a gigantic Heathen and Titan ; stumbling blindly , undismayed ,
down to his rest . At half @-@ past eight in the morning , Dr. Petit , standing
at the foot of the bed , says &quot; Il ne souffre plus . &quot; His suffering and his
working are now ended .

Even so , ye silent Patriot multitudes , all ye men of France ; this man
is rapt away from you . He has fallen suddenly , without bending till he
broke ; as a tower falls , smitten by sudden lightning . His word ye shall
hear no more , his guidance follow no more . -- The multitudes depart ,
heartstruck ; spread the sad tidings . How touching is the loyalty of men
to their Sovereign Man ! All theatres , public amusements close ; no joyful
meeting can be held in these nights , joy is not for them : the People
break in upon private dancing @-@ parties , and sullenly command that they
cease . Of such dancing @-@ parties apparently but two came to light ; and
these also have gone out . The gloom is universal : never in this City was
such sorrow for one death ; never since that old night when Louis XII .
departed , &apos; and the Crieurs des Corps went sounding their bells , and
crying along the streets : Le bon roi Louis , pere du peuple , est mort ,
The good King Louis , Father of the People , is dead ! &apos; ( Henault , Abrege
Chronologique , p . 429 . ) King Mirabeau is now the lost King ; and one may
say with little exaggeration , all the People mourns for him .

For three days there is low wide moan : weeping in the National Assembly
itself . The streets are all mournful ; orators mounted on the bournes ,
with large silent audience , preaching the funeral sermon of the dead .
Let no coachman whip fast , distractively with his rolling wheels , or
almost at all , through these groups ! His traces may be cut ; himself and
his fare , as incurable Aristocrats , hurled sulkily into the kennels . The
bourne @-@ stone orators speak as it is given them ; the Sansculottic People ,
with its rude soul , listens eager , -- as men will to any Sermon , or Sermo ,
when it is a spoken Word meaning a Thing , and not a Babblement meaning
No @-@ thing . In the Restaurateur &apos;s of the Palais Royal , the waiter remarks ,
&quot; Fine weather , Monsieur : &quot; -- &quot; Yes , my friend , &quot; answers the ancient Man of
Letters , &quot; very fine ; but Mirabeau is dead . &quot; Hoarse rhythmic threnodies
comes also from the throats of balladsingers ; are sold on gray @-@ white
paper at a sou each . ( Fils Adoptif , viii. l . 19 ; Newspapers and Excerpts
( in Hist . Parl. ix . 366 @-@ 402 ) . ) But of Portraits , engraved , painted ,
hewn , and written ; of Eulogies , Reminiscences , Biographies , nay
Vaudevilles , Dramas and Melodramas , in all Provinces of France , there
will , through these coming months , be the due immeasurable crop ; thick
as the leaves of Spring . Nor , that a tincture of burlesque might be in
it , is Gobel &apos;s Episcopal Mandement wanting ; goose Gobel , who has just
been made Constitutional Bishop of Paris . A Mandement wherein ca ira
alternates very strangely with Nomine Domini , and you are , with a grave
countenance , invited to &apos; rejoice at possessing in the midst of you a
body of Prelates created by Mirabeau , zealous followers of his doctrine ,
faithful imitators of his virtues . &apos; ( Hist . Parl. ix . 405 . ) So speaks ,
and cackles manifold , the Sorrow of France ; wailing articulately ,
inarticulately , as it can , that a Sovereign Man is snatched away . In
the National Assembly , when difficult questions are astir , all eyes will
&apos;turn mechanically to the place where Mirabeau sat , &apos; -- and Mirabeau is
absent now .

On the third evening of the lamentation , the fourth of April , there is
solemn Public Funeral ; such as deceased mortal seldom had . Procession of
a league in length ; of mourners reckoned loosely at a hundred thousand !
All roofs are thronged with onlookers , all windows , lamp @-@ irons , branches
of trees . &apos; Sadness is painted on every countenance ; many persons weep . &apos; 
There is double hedge of National Guards ; there is National Assembly in
a body ; Jacobin Society , and Societies ; King &apos;s Ministers , Municipals ,
and all Notabilities , Patriot or Aristocrat . Bouille is noticeable
there , &apos; with his hat on ; &apos; say , hat drawn over his brow , hiding many
thoughts ! Slow @-@ wending , in religious silence , the Procession of a league
in length , under the level sun @-@ rays , for it is five o &apos;clock , moves and
marches : with its sable plumes ; itself in a religious silence ; but , by
fits , with the muffled roll of drums , by fits with some long @-@ drawn
wail of music , and strange new clangour of trombones , and metallic
dirge @-@ voice ; amid the infinite hum of men . In the Church of
Saint @-@ Eustache , there is funeral oration by Cerutti ; and discharge of
fire @-@ arms , which &apos; brings down pieces of the plaster . &apos; Thence , forward
again to the Church of Sainte @-@ Genevieve ; which has been consecrated , by
supreme decree , on the spur of this time , into a Pantheon for the Great
Men of the Fatherland , Aux Grands Hommes la Patrie reconnaissante .
Hardly at midnight is the business done ; and Mirabeau left in his dark
dwelling : first tenant of that Fatherland &apos;s Pantheon .

Tenant , alas , with inhabits but at will , and shall be cast out ! For , in
these days of convulsion and disjection , not even the dust of the dead
is permitted to rest . Voltaire &apos;s bones are , by and by , to be carried
from their stolen grave in the Abbey of Scellieres , to an eager stealing
grave , in Paris his birth @-@ city : all mortals processioning and perorating
there ; cars drawn by eight white horses , goadsters in classical costume ,
with fillets and wheat @-@ ears enough ; -- though the weather is of the
wettest . ( Moniteur , du 13 Juillet 1791 . ) Evangelist Jean Jacques , too ,
as is most proper , must be dug up from Ermenonville , and processioned ,
with pomp , with sensibility , to the Pantheon of the Fatherland . ( Ibid .
du 18 Septembre , 1794 . See also du 30 Aout , &amp; c . 1791 . ) He and others :
while again Mirabeau , we say , is cast forth from it , happily incapable
of being replaced ; and rests now , irrecognisable , reburied hastily at
dead of night , in the central &apos; part of the Churchyard Sainte @-@ Catherine ,
in the Suburb Saint @-@ Marceau , &apos; to be disturbed no further .

So blazes out , farseen , a Man &apos;s Life , and becomes ashes and a caput
mortuum , in this World @-@ Pyre , which we name French Revolution : not the
first that consumed itself there ; nor , by thousands and many millions ,
the last ! A man who &apos; had swallowed all formulas ; &apos; who , in these strange
times and circumstances , felt called to live Titanically , and also to
die so . As he , for his part had swallowed all formulas , what Formula is
there , never so comprehensive , that will express truly the plus and the
minus , give us the accurate net @-@ result of him ? There is hitherto none
such . Moralities not a few must shriek condemnatory over this Mirabeau ;
the Morality by which he could be judged has not yet got uttered in the
speech of men . We shall say this of him , again : That he is a Reality ,
and no Simulacrum : a living son of Nature our general Mother ; not a
hollow Artfice , and mechanism of Conventionalities , son of nothing ,
brother to nothing . In which little word , let the earnest man , walking
sorrowful in a world mostly of &apos; Stuffed Clothes @-@ suits , &apos; that chatter and
grin meaningless on him , quite ghastly to the earnest soul , -- think what
significance there is !

Of men who , in such sense , are alive , and see with eyes , the number is
now not great : it may be well , if in this huge French Revolution itself ,
with its all @-@ developing fury , we find some Three . Mortals driven rabid
we find ; sputtering the acridest logic ; baring their breast to the
battle @-@ hail , their neck to the guillotine ; of whom it is so painful to
say that they too are still , in good part , manufactured Formalities , not
Facts but Hearsays !

Honour to the strong man , in these ages , who has shaken himself loose
of shams , and is something . For in the way of being worthy , the first
condition surely is that one be . Let Cant cease , at all risks and at all
costs : till Cant cease , nothing else can begin . Of human Criminals , in
these centuries , writes the Moralist , I find but one unforgivable : the
Quack . &apos; Hateful to God , &apos; as divine Dante sings , &apos; and to the Enemies of
God ,

&apos;A Dio spiacente ed a &apos; nemici sui ! &apos;

But whoever will , with sympathy , which is the first essential towards
insight , look at this questionable Mirabeau , may find that there
lay verily in him , as the basis of all , a Sincerity , a great free
Earnestness ; nay call it Honesty , for the man did before all things see ,
with that clear flashing vision , into what was , into what existed as
fact ; and did , with his wild heart , follow that and no other . Whereby on
what ways soever he travels and struggles , often enough falling , he
is still a brother man . Hate him not ; thou canst not hate him ! Shining
through such soil and tarnish , and now victorious effulgent , and
oftenest struggling eclipsed , the light of genius itself is in this
man ; which was never yet base and hateful : but at worst was lamentable ,
loveable with pity . They say that he was ambitious , that he wanted to be
Minister . It is most true ; and was he not simply the one man in France
who could have done any good as Minister ? Not vanity alone , not pride
alone ; far from that ! Wild burstings of affection were in this great
heart ; of fierce lightning , and soft dew of pity . So sunk , bemired in
wretchedest defacements , it may be said of him , like the Magdalen of
old , that he loved much : his Father the harshest of old crabbed men he
loved with warmth , with veneration .

Be it that his falls and follies are manifold , -- as himself often
lamented even with tears . ( Dumont , p . 287 . ) Alas , is not the Life of
every such man already a poetic Tragedy ; made up &apos; of Fate and of one &apos;s
own Deservings , &apos; of Schicksal und eigene Schuld ; full of the elements of
Pity and Fear ? This brother man , if not Epic for us , is Tragic ; if not
great , is large ; large in his qualities , world @-@ large in his destinies .
Whom other men , recognising him as such , may , through long times ,
remember , and draw nigh to examine and consider : these , in their several
dialects , will say of him and sing of him , -- till the right thing be
said ; and so the Formula that can judge him be no longer an undiscovered
one .

Here then the wild Gabriel Honore drops from the tissue of our History ;
not without a tragic farewell . He is gone : the flower of the wild
Riquetti or Arrighetti kindred ; which seems as if in him , with one last
effort , it had done its best , and then expired , or sunk down to the
undistinguished level . Crabbed old Marquis Mirabeau , the Friend of Men ,
sleeps sound . The Bailli Mirabeau , worthy uncle , will soon die forlorn ,
alone . Barrel @-@ Mirabeau , already gone across the Rhine , his Regiment
of Emigrants will drive nigh desperate . &apos; Barrel @-@ Mirabeau , &apos; says a
biographer of his , &apos; went indignantly across the Rhine , and drilled
Emigrant Regiments . But as he sat one morning in his tent , sour of
stomach doubtless and of heart , meditating in Tartarean humour on the
turn things took , a certain Captain or Subaltern demanded admittance on
business . Such Captain is refused ; he again demands , with refusal ; and
then again , till Colonel Viscount Barrel @-@ Mirabeau , blazing up into a
mere burning brandy barrel , clutches his sword , and tumbles out on this
canaille of an intruder , -- alas , on the canaille of an intruder &apos;s sword &apos;s
point , who had drawn with swift dexterity ; and dies , and the Newspapers
name it apoplexy and alarming accident . &apos; So die the Mirabeaus .

New Mirabeaus one hears not of : the wild kindred , as we said , is gone
out with this its greatest . As families and kindreds sometimes
do ; producing , after long ages of unnoted notability , some living
quintescence of all the qualities they had , to flame forth as a man
world @-@ noted ; after whom they rest as if exhausted ; the sceptre passing
to others . The chosen Last of the Mirabeaus is gone ; the chosen man of
France is gone . It was he who shook old France from its basis ; and , as
if with his single hand , has held it toppling there , still unfallen .
What things depended on that one man ! He is as a ship suddenly shivered
on sunk rocks : much swims on the waste waters , far from help .

The French Monarchy may now therefore be considered as , in all human
probability , lost ; as struggling henceforth in blindness as well as
weakness , the last light of reasonable guidance having gone out . What
remains of resources their poor Majesties will waste still further , in
uncertain loitering and wavering . Mirabeau himself had to complain that
they only gave him half confidence , and always had some plan within his
plan . Had they fled frankly with him , to Rouen or anywhither , long ago !
They may fly now with chance immeasurably lessened ; which will go on
lessening towards absolute zero . Decide , O Queen ; poor Louis can
decide nothing : execute this Flight @-@ project , or at least abandon
it . Correspondence with Bouille there has been enough ; what profits
consulting , and hypothesis , while all around is in fierce activity of
practice ? The Rustic sits waiting till the river run dry : alas with you
it is not a common river , but a Nile Inundation ; snow melting in the
unseen mountains ; till all , and you where you sit , be submerged .

Many things invite to flight . The voice Journals invites ; Royalist
Journals proudly hinting it as a threat , Patriot Journals rabidly
denouncing it as a terror . Mother Society , waxing more and more
emphatic , invites ; -- so emphatic that , as was prophesied , Lafayette and
your limited Patriots have ere long to branch off from her , and form
themselves into Feuillans ; with infinite public controversy ; the victory
in which , doubtful though it look , will remain with the unlimited
Mother . Moreover , ever since the Day of Poniards , we have seen
unlimited Patriotism openly equipping itself with arms . Citizens denied
&apos;activity , &apos; which is facetiously made to signify a certain weight of
purse , cannot buy blue uniforms , and be Guardsmen ; but man is greater
than blue cloth ; man can fight , if need be , in multiform cloth , or even
almost without cloth -- as Sansculotte . So Pikes continued to be hammered ,
whether those Dirks of improved structure with barbs be &apos; meant for
the West @-@ India market , &apos; or not meant . Men beat , the wrong way , their
ploughshares into swords . Is there not what we may call an &apos; Austrian
Committee , &apos; Comite Autrichein , sitting daily and nightly in the
Tuileries ? Patriotism , by vision and suspicion , knows it too well ! If
the King fly , will there not be Aristocrat @-@ Austrian Invasion ; butchery ,
replacement of Feudalism ; wars more than civil ? The hearts of men are
saddened and maddened .

Dissident Priests likewise give trouble enough . Expelled from their
Parish Churches , where Constitutional Priests , elected by the Public ,
have replaced them , these unhappy persons resort to Convents of Nuns , or
other such receptacles ; and there , on Sabbath , collecting assemblages of
Anti @-@ Constitutional individuals , who have grown devout all on a sudden ,
( Toulongeon , i . 262 . ) they worship or pretend to worship in their
strait @-@ laced contumacious manner ; to the scandal of Patriotism .
Dissident Priests , passing along with their sacred wafer for the dying ,
seem wishful to be massacred in the streets ; wherein Patriotism will not
gratify them . Slighter palm of martyrdom , however , shall not be denied :
martyrdom not of massacre , yet of fustigation . At the refractory places
of worship , Patriot men appear ; Patriot women with strong hazel wands ,
which they apply . Shut thy eyes , O Reader ; see not this misery , peculiar
to these later times , -- of martyrdom without sincerity , with only cant
and contumacy ! A dead Catholic Church is not allowed to lie dead ; no ,
it is galvanised into the detestablest death @-@ life ; whereat Humanity , we
say , shuts its eyes . For the Patriot women take their hazel wands , and
fustigate , amid laughter of bystanders , with alacrity : broad bottom of
Priests ; alas , Nuns too reversed , and cotillons retrousses ! The
National Guard does what it can : Municipality &apos; invokes the Principles
of Toleration ; &apos; grants Dissident worshippers the Church of the Theatins ;
promising protection . But it is to no purpose : at the door of that
Theatins Church , appears a Placard , and suspended atop , like Plebeian
Consular fasces , -- a Bundle of Rods ! The Principles of Toleration must
do the best they may : but no Dissident man shall worship contumaciously ;
there is a Plebiscitum to that effect ; which , though unspoken , is like
the laws of the Medes and Persians . Dissident contumacious Priests
ought not to be harboured , even in private , by any man : the Club of the
Cordeliers openly denounces Majesty himself as doing it . ( Newspapers of
April and June , 1791 ( in Hist . Parl. ix . 449 ; x , 217 ) . )

Many things invite to flight : but probably this thing above all others ,
that it has become impossible ! On the 15th of April , notice is given
that his Majesty , who has suffered much from catarrh lately , will enjoy
the Spring weather , for a few days , at Saint @-@ Cloud . Out at Saint @-@ Cloud ?
Wishing to celebrate his Easter , his Paques , or Pasch , there ; with
refractory Anti @-@ Constitutional Dissidents ? -- Wishing rather to make off
for Compiegne , and thence to the Frontiers ? As were , in good sooth ,
perhaps feasible , or would once have been ; nothing but some two
chasseurs attending you ; chasseurs easily corrupted ! It is a pleasant
possibility , execute it or not . Men say there are thirty thousand
Chevaliers of the Poniard lurking in the woods there : lurking in the
woods , and thirty thousand , -- for the human Imagination is not fettered .
But now , how easily might these , dashing out on Lafayette , snatch off
the Hereditary Representative ; and roll away with him , after the manner
of a whirlblast , whither they listed ! -- Enough , it were well the King did
not go . Lafayette is forewarned and forearmed : but , indeed , is the risk
his only ; or his and all France &apos;s ?

Monday the eighteenth of April is come ; the Easter Journey to
Saint @-@ Cloud shall take effect . National Guard has got its orders ;
a First Division , as Advanced Guard , has even marched , and probably
arrived . His Majesty &apos;s Maison @-@ bouche , they say , is all busy stewing and
frying at Saint @-@ Cloud ; the King &apos;s Dinner not far from ready there . About
one o &apos;clock , the Royal Carriage , with its eight royal blacks , shoots
stately into the Place du Carrousel ; draws up to receive its royal
burden . But hark ! From the neighbouring Church of Saint @-@ Roch , the
tocsin begins ding @-@ donging . Is the King stolen then ; he is going ; gone ?
Multitudes of persons crowd the Carrousel : the Royal Carriage still
stands there ; -- and , by Heaven &apos;s strength , shall stand !

Lafayette comes up , with aide @-@ de @-@ camps and oratory ; pervading the
groups : &quot; Taisez vous , &quot; answer the groups , &quot; the King shall not go . &quot;
Monsieur appears , at an upper window : ten thousand voices bray and
shriek , &quot; Nous ne voulons pas que le Roi parte . &quot; Their Majesties have
mounted . Crack go the whips ; but twenty Patriot arms have seized each
of the eight bridles : there is rearing , rocking , vociferation ; not the
smallest headway . In vain does Lafayette fret , indignant ; and perorate
and strive : Patriots in the passion of terror , bellow round the Royal
Carriage ; it is one bellowing sea of Patriot terror run frantic . Will
Royalty fly off towards Austria ; like a lit rocket , towards endless
Conflagration of Civil War ? Stop it , ye Patriots , in the name of Heaven !
Rude voices passionately apostrophise Royalty itself . Usher Campan , and
other the like official persons , pressing forward with help or advice ,
are clutched by the sashes , and hurled and whirled , in a confused
perilous manner ; so that her Majesty has to plead passionately from the
carriage @-@ window .

Order cannot be heard , cannot be followed ; National Guards know not how
to act . Centre Grenadiers , of the Observatoire Battalion , are there ;
not on duty ; alas , in quasi @-@ mutiny ; speaking rude disobedient words ;
threatening the mounted Guards with sharp shot if they hurt the people .
Lafayette mounts and dismounts ; runs haranguing , panting ; on the verge
of despair . For an hour and three @-@ quarters ; &apos; seven quarters of an hour , &apos;
by the Tuileries Clock ! Desperate Lafayette will open a passage , were
it by the cannon &apos;s mouth , if his Majesty will order . Their Majesties ,
counselled to it by Royalist friends , by Patriot foes , dismount ;
and retire in , with heavy indignant heart ; giving up the enterprise .
Maison @-@ bouche may eat that cooked dinner themselves ; his Majesty shall
not see Saint @-@ Cloud this day , -- or any day . ( Deux Amis , vi. c . 1 ; Hist .
Parl. ix . 407 @-@ 14 . )

The pathetic fable of imprisonment in one &apos;s own Palace has become a sad
fact , then ? Majesty complains to Assembly ; Municipality deliberates ,
proposes to petition or address ; Sections respond with sullen brevity
of negation . Lafayette flings down his Commission ; appears in civic
pepper @-@ and @-@ salt frock ; and cannot be flattered back again ; -- not in less
than three days ; and by unheard @-@ of entreaty ; National Guards kneeling
to him , and declaring that it is not sycophancy , that they are free
men kneeling here to the Statue of Liberty . For the rest , those
Centre Grenadiers of the Observatoire are disbanded , -- yet indeed are
reinlisted , all but fourteen , under a new name , and with new quarters .
The King must keep his Easter in Paris : meditating much on this singular
posture of things : but as good as determined now to fly from it , desire
being whetted by difficulty .



Chapter 2.4.II.

Easter at Paris .

For above a year , ever since March 1790 , it would seem , there has
hovered a project of Flight before the royal mind ; and ever and anon has
been condensing itself into something like a purpose ; but this or the
other difficulty always vaporised it again . It seems so full of risks ,
perhaps of civil war itself ; above all , it cannot be done without
effort . Somnolent laziness will not serve : to fly , if not in a leather
vache , one must verily stir himself . Better to adopt that Constitution
of theirs ; execute it so as to shew all men that it is inexecutable ?
Better or not so good ; surely it is easier . To all difficulties you need
only say , There is a lion in the path , behold your Constitution will
not act ! For a somnolent person it requires no effort to counterfeit
death , -- as Dame de Stael and Friends of Liberty can see the King &apos;s
Government long doing , faisant le mort .

Nay now , when desire whetted by difficulty has brought the matter to a
head , and the royal mind no longer halts between two , what can come
of it ? Grant that poor Louis were safe with Bouille , what on the whole
could he look for there ? Exasperated Tickets of Entry answer , Much , all .
But cold Reason answers , Little almost nothing . Is not loyalty a law
of Nature ? ask the Tickets of Entry . Is not love of your King , and even
death for him , the glory of all Frenchmen , -- except these few Democrats ?
Let Democrat Constitution @-@ builders see what they will do without
their Keystone ; and France rend its hair , having lost the Hereditary
Representative !

Thus will King Louis fly ; one sees not reasonably towards what . As a
maltreated Boy , shall we say , who , having a Stepmother , rushes sulky
into the wide world ; and will wring the paternal heart ? -- Poor Louis
escapes from known unsupportable evils , to an unknown mixture of good
and evil , coloured by Hope . He goes , as Rabelais did when dying , to seek
a great May @-@ be : je vais chercher un grand Peut @-@ etre ! As not only
the sulky Boy but the wise grown Man is obliged to do , so often , in
emergencies .

For the rest , there is still no lack of stimulants , and stepdame
maltreatments , to keep one &apos;s resolution at the due pitch . Factious
disturbance ceases not : as indeed how can they , unless authoritatively
conjured , in a Revolt which is by nature bottomless ? If the ceasing
of faction be the price of the King &apos;s somnolence , he may awake when he
will , and take wing .

Remark , in any case , what somersets and contortions a dead Catholicism
is making , -- skilfully galvanised : hideous , and even piteous , to
behold ! Jurant and Dissident , with their shaved crowns , argue frothing
everywhere ; or are ceasing to argue , and stripping for battle . In Paris
was scourging while need continued : contrariwise , in the Morbihan
of Brittany , without scourging , armed Peasants are up , roused by
pulpit @-@ drum , they know not why . General Dumouriez , who has got missioned
thitherward , finds all in sour heat of darkness ; finds also that
explanation and conciliation will still do much . ( Deux Amis , v. 410 @-@ 21 ;
Dumouriez , ii. c . 5 . )

But again , consider this : that his Holiness , Pius Sixth , has seen
good to excommunicate Bishop Talleyrand ! Surely , we will say then ,
considering it , there is no living or dead Church in the Earth that has
not the indubitablest right to excommunicate Talleyrand . Pope Pius has
right and might , in his way . But truly so likewise has Father Adam ,
ci @-@ devant Marquis Saint @-@ Huruge , in his way . Behold , therefore , on the
Fourth of May , in the Palais @-@ Royal , a mixed loud @-@ sounding multitude ; in
the middle of whom , Father Adam , bull @-@ voiced Saint @-@ Huruge , in white
hat , towers visible and audible . With him , it is said , walks Journalist
Gorsas , walk many others of the washed sort ; for no authority will
interfere . Pius Sixth , with his plush and tiara , and power of the Keys ,
they bear aloft : of natural size , -- made of lath and combustible gum .
Royou , the King &apos;s Friend , is borne too in effigy ; with a pile of
Newspaper King &apos;s @-@ Friends , condemned numbers of the Ami @-@ du @-@ Roi ; fit
fuel of the sacrifice . Speeches are spoken ; a judgment is held , a doom
proclaimed , audible in bull @-@ voice , towards the four winds . And thus ,
amid great shouting , the holocaust is consummated , under the summer sky ;
and our lath @-@ and @-@ gum Holiness , with the attendant victims , mounts up in
flame , and sinks down in ashes ; a decomposed Pope : and right or might ,
among all the parties , has better or worse accomplished itself , as it
could . ( Hist . Parl. x . 99 @-@ 102 . ) But , on the whole , reckoning from Martin
Luther in the Marketplace of Wittenberg to Marquis Saint @-@ Huruge in this
Palais @-@ Royal of Paris , what a journey have we gone ; into what strange
territories has it carried us ! No Authority can now interfere . Nay
Religion herself , mourning for such things , may after all ask , What have
I to do with them ?

In such extraordinary manner does dead Catholicism somerset and
caper , skilfully galvanised . For , does the reader inquire into the
subject @-@ matter of controversy in this case ; what the difference between
Orthodoxy or My @-@ doxy and Heterodoxy or Thy @-@ doxy might here be ?
My @-@ doxy is that an august National Assembly can equalize the extent of
Bishopricks ; that an equalized Bishop , his Creed and Formularies being
left quite as they were , can swear Fidelity to King , Law and Nation , and
so become a Constitutional Bishop . Thy @-@ doxy , if thou be Dissident ,
is that he cannot ; but that he must become an accursed thing . Human
ill @-@ nature needs but some Homoiousian iota , or even the pretence of one ;
and will flow copiously through the eye of a needle : thus always must
mortals go jargoning and fuming ,


And , like the ancient Stoics in their porches
With fierce dispute maintain their churches .

This Auto @-@ da @-@ fe of Saint @-@ Huruge &apos;s was on the Fourth of May , 1791 .
Royalty sees it ; but says nothing .



Chapter 2.4.III.

Count Fersen .

Royalty , in fact , should , by this time , be far on with its preparations .
Unhappily much preparation is needful : could a Hereditary Representative
be carried in leather vache , how easy were it ! But it is not so .

New clothes are needed , as usual , in all Epic transactions , were it
in the grimmest iron ages ; consider &apos; Queen Chrimhilde , with her sixty
semstresses , &apos; in that iron Nibelungen Song ! No Queen can stir without
new clothes . Therefore , now , Dame Campan whisks assiduous to this
mantua @-@ maker and to that : and there is clipping of frocks and gowns ,
upper clothes and under , great and small ; such a clipping and sewing , as
might have been dispensed with . Moreover , her Majesty cannot go a step
anywhither without her Necessaire ; dear Necessaire , of inlaid ivory and
rosewood ; cunningly devised ; which holds perfumes , toilet @-@ implements ,
infinite small queenlike furnitures : Necessary to terrestrial life . Not
without a cost of some five hundred louis , of much precious time , and
difficult hoodwinking which does not blind , can this same Necessary
of life be forwarded by the Flanders Carriers , -- never to get to hand .
( Campan , ii. c . 18 . ) All which , you would say , augurs ill for the
prospering of the enterprise . But the whims of women and queens must be
humoured .

Bouille , on his side , is making a fortified Camp at Montmedi ; gathering
Royal @-@ Allemand , and all manner of other German and true French Troops
thither , &apos; to watch the Austrians . &apos; His Majesty will not cross the
Frontiers , unless on compulsion . Neither shall the Emigrants be much
employed , hateful as they are to all people . ( Bouille , Memoires , ii. c .
10 . ) Nor shall old war @-@ god Broglie have any hand in the business ; but
solely our brave Bouille ; to whom , on the day of meeting , a Marshal &apos;s
Baton shall be delivered , by a rescued King , amid the shouting of all
the troops . In the meanwhile , Paris being so suspicious , were it
not perhaps good to write your Foreign Ambassadors an ostensible
Constitutional Letter ; desiring all Kings and men to take heed that King
Louis loves the Constitution , that he has voluntarily sworn , and does
again swear , to maintain the same , and will reckon those his enemies who
affect to say otherwise ? Such a Constitutional circular is despatched by
Couriers , is communicated confidentially to the Assembly , and printed in
all Newspapers ; with the finest effect . ( Moniteur , Seance du 23 Avril ,
1791 . ) Simulation and dissimulation mingle extensively in human affairs .

We observe , however , that Count Fersen is often using his Ticket of
Entry ; which surely he has clear right to do . A gallant Soldier and
Swede , devoted to this fair Queen ; -- as indeed the Highest Swede now is .
Has not King Gustav , famed fiery Chevalier du Nord , sworn himself , by
the old laws of chivalry , her Knight ? He will descend on fire @-@ wings , of
Swedish musketry , and deliver her from these foul dragons , -- if , alas ,
the assassin &apos;s pistol intervene not !

But , in fact , Count Fersen does seem a likely young soldier , of alert
decisive ways : he circulates widely , seen , unseen ; and has business on
hand . Also Colonel the Duke de Choiseul , nephew of Choiseul the great ,
of Choiseul the now deceased ; he and Engineer Goguelat are passing and
repassing between Metz and the Tuileries ; and Letters go in cipher , -- one
of them , a most important one , hard to decipher ; Fersen having ciphered
it in haste . ( Choiseul , Relation du Depart de Louis XVI . ( Paris , 1822 ) ,
p . 39 . ) As for Duke de Villequier , he is gone ever since the Day of
Poniards ; but his Apartment is useful for her Majesty .

On the other side , poor Commandment Gouvion , watching at the Tuileries ,
second in National Command , sees several things hard to interpret . It
is the same Gouvion who sat , long months ago , at the Townhall , gazing
helpless into that Insurrection of Women ; motionless , as the brave
stabled steed when conflagration rises , till Usher Maillard snatched his
drum . Sincerer Patriot there is not ; but many a shiftier . He , if Dame
Campan gossip credibly , is paying some similitude of love @-@ court to a
certain false Chambermaid of the Palace , who betrays much to him :
the Necessaire , the clothes , the packing of the jewels , ( Campan , ii .
141 . ) -- could he understand it when betrayed . Helpless Gouvion gazes with
sincere glassy eyes into it ; stirs up his sentries to vigilence ; walks
restless to and fro ; and hopes the best .

But , on the whole , one finds that , in the second week of June , Colonel
de Choiseul is privately in Paris ; having come &apos; to see his children . &apos; 
Also that Fersen has got a stupendous new Coach built , of the kind named
Berline ; done by the first artists ; according to a model : they bring it
home to him , in Choiseul &apos;s presence ; the two friends take a proof @-@ drive
in it , along the streets ; in meditative mood ; then send it up to &apos; Madame
Sullivan &apos;s , in the Rue de Clichy , &apos; far North , to wait there till wanted .
Apparently a certain Russian Baroness de Korff , with Waiting @-@ woman ,
Valet , and two Children , will travel homewards with some state : in
whom these young military gentlemen take interest ? A Passport has been
procured for her ; and much assistance shewn , with Coach @-@ builders
and such like ; -- so helpful polite are young military men . Fersen has
likewise purchased a Chaise fit for two , at least for two waiting @-@ maids ;
further , certain necessary horses : one would say , he is himself quitting
France , not without outlay ? We observe finally that their Majesties ,
Heaven willing , will assist at Corpus @-@ Christi Day , this blessed Summer
Solstice , in Assumption Church , here at Paris , to the joy of all the
world . For which same day , moreover , brave Bouille , at Metz , as we find ,
has invited a party of friends to dinner ; but indeed is gone from home ,
in the interim , over to Montmedi .

These are of the Phenomena , or visual Appearances , of this wide @-@ working
terrestrial world : which truly is all phenomenal , what they call
spectral ; and never rests at any moment ; one never at any moment can
know why .

On Monday night , the Twentieth of June 1791 , about eleven o &apos;clock , there
is many a hackney @-@ coach , and glass @-@ coach ( carrosse de remise ) , still
rumbling , or at rest , on the streets of Paris . But of all Glass @-@ coaches ,
we recommend this to thee , O Reader , which stands drawn up , in the Rue
de l &apos;Echelle , hard by the Carrousel and outgate of the Tuileries ; in the
Rue de l &apos;Echelle that then was ; &apos; opposite Ronsin the saddler &apos;s door , &apos; as
if waiting for a fare there ! Not long does it wait : a hooded Dame , with
two hooded Children has issued from Villequier &apos;s door , where no sentry
walks , into the Tuileries Court @-@ of @-@ Princes ; into the Carrousel ; into
the Rue de l &apos;Echelle ; where the Glass @-@ coachman readily admits them ;
and again waits . Not long ; another Dame , likewise hooded or shrouded ,
leaning on a servant , issues in the same manner , by the Glass @-@ coachman ,
cheerfully admitted . Whither go , so many Dames ? &apos; Tis His Majesty &apos;s
Couchee , Majesty just gone to bed , and all the Palace @-@ world is retiring
home . But the Glass @-@ coachman still waits ; his fare seemingly incomplete .

By and by , we note a thickset Individual , in round hat and peruke ,
arm @-@ and @-@ arm with some servant , seemingly of the Runner or Courier sort ;
he also issues through Villequier &apos;s door ; starts a shoebuckle as he
passes one of the sentries , stoops down to clasp it again ; is however ,
by the Glass @-@ coachman , still more cheerfully admitted . And now , is his
fare complete ? Not yet ; the Glass @-@ coachman still waits . -- Alas ! and the
false Chambermaid has warned Gouvion that she thinks the Royal Family
will fly this very night ; and Gouvion distrusting his own glazed eyes ,
has sent express for Lafayette ; and Lafayette &apos;s Carriage , flaring
with lights , rolls this moment through the inner Arch of the
Carrousel , -- where a Lady shaded in broad gypsy @-@ hat , and leaning on the
arm of a servant , also of the Runner or Courier sort , stands aside
to let it pass , and has even the whim to touch a spoke of it with her
badine , -- light little magic rod which she calls badine , such as the
Beautiful then wore . The flare of Lafayette &apos;s Carriage , rolls past :
all is found quiet in the Court @-@ of @-@ Princes ; sentries at their post ;
Majesties &apos; Apartments closed in smooth rest . Your false Chambermaid must
have been mistaken ? Watch thou , Gouvion , with Argus &apos; vigilance ; for , of
a truth , treachery is within these walls .

But where is the Lady that stood aside in gypsy hat , and touched the
wheel @-@ spoke with her badine ? O Reader , that Lady that touched the
wheel @-@ spoke was the Queen of France ! She has issued safe through
that inner Arch , into the Carrousel itself ; but not into the Rue de
l &apos;Echelle . Flurried by the rattle and rencounter , she took the right
hand not the left ; neither she nor her Courier knows Paris ; he indeed
is no Courier , but a loyal stupid ci @-@ devant Bodyguard disguised as
one . They are off , quite wrong , over the Pont Royal and River ; roaming
disconsolate in the Rue du Bac ; far from the Glass @-@ coachman , who still
waits . Waits , with flutter of heart ; with thoughts -- which he must button
close up , under his jarvie surtout !

Midnight clangs from all the City @-@ steeples ; one precious hour has been
spent so ; most mortals are asleep . The Glass @-@ coachman waits ; and what
mood ! A brother jarvie drives up , enters into conversation ; is answered
cheerfully in jarvie dialect : the brothers of the whip exchange a pinch
of snuff ; ( Weber , ii . 340 @-@ 2 ; Choiseul , p . 44 @-@ 56 . ) decline drinking
together ; and part with good night . Be the Heavens blest ! here at length
is the Queen @-@ lady , in gypsy @-@ hat ; safe after perils ; who has had to
inquire her way . She too is admitted ; her Courier jumps aloft , as
the other , who is also a disguised Bodyguard , has done : and now , O
Glass @-@ coachman of a thousand , -- Count Fersen , for the Reader sees it is
thou , -- drive !

Dust shall not stick to the hoofs of Fersen : crack ! crack ! the
Glass @-@ coach rattles , and every soul breathes lighter . But is Fersen on
the right road ? Northeastward , to the Barrier of Saint @-@ Martin and Metz
Highway , thither were we bound : and lo , he drives right Northward ! The
royal Individual , in round hat and peruke , sits astonished ; but right
or wrong , there is no remedy . Crack , crack , we go incessant , through the
slumbering City . Seldom , since Paris rose out of mud , or the Longhaired
Kings went in Bullock @-@ carts , was there such a drive . Mortals on each
hand of you , close by , stretched out horizontal , dormant ; and we alive
and quaking ! Crack , crack , through the Rue de Grammont ; across the
Boulevard ; up the Rue de la Chaussee d &apos;Antin , -- these windows , all
silent , of Number 42 , were Mirabeau &apos;s . Towards the Barrier not of
Saint @-@ Martin , but of Clichy on the utmost North ! Patience , ye royal
Individuals ; Fersen understands what he is about . Passing up the Rue
de Clichy , he alights for one moment at Madame Sullivan &apos;s : &quot; Did Count
Fersen &apos;s Coachman get the Baroness de Korff &apos;s new Berline ? &quot; -- &quot; Gone with
it an hour @-@ and @-@ half ago , &quot; grumbles responsive the drowsy Porter . -- &quot; C &apos;est
bien . &quot; Yes , it is well ; -- though had not such hour @-@ and half been lost ,
it were still better . Forth therefore , O Fersen , fast , by the Barrier
de Clichy ; then Eastward along the Outward Boulevard , what horses and
whipcord can do !

Thus Fersen drives , through the ambrosial night . Sleeping Paris is now
all on the right hand of him ; silent except for some snoring hum ;
and now he is Eastward as far as the Barrier de Saint @-@ Martin ; looking
earnestly for Baroness de Korff &apos;s Berline . This Heaven &apos;s Berline he
at length does descry , drawn up with its six horses , his own German
Coachman waiting on the box . Right , thou good German : now haste , whither
thou knowest ! -- And as for us of the Glass @-@ coach , haste too , O haste ;
much time is already lost ! The august Glass @-@ coach fare , six Insides ,
hastily packs itself into the new Berline ; two Bodyguard Couriers
behind . The Glass @-@ coach itself is turned adrift , its head towards the
City ; to wander whither it lists , -- and be found next morning tumbled in
a ditch . But Fersen is on the new box , with its brave new hammer @-@ cloths ;
flourishing his whip ; he bolts forward towards Bondy . There a third and
final Bodyguard Courier of ours ought surely to be , with post @-@ horses
ready @-@ ordered . There likewise ought that purchased Chaise , with the two
Waiting @-@ maids and their bandboxes to be ; whom also her Majesty could
not travel without . Swift , thou deft Fersen , and may the Heavens turn it
well !

Once more , by Heaven &apos;s blessing , it is all well . Here is the sleeping
Hamlet of Bondy ; Chaise with Waiting @-@ women ; horses all ready , and
postillions with their churn @-@ boots , impatient in the dewy dawn . Brief
harnessing done , the postillions with their churn @-@ boots vault into the
saddles ; brandish circularly their little noisy whips . Fersen , under his
jarvie @-@ surtout , bends in lowly silent reverence of adieu ; royal hands
wave speechless in expressible response ; Baroness de Korff &apos;s Berline ,
with the Royalty of France , bounds off : for ever , as it proved . Deft
Fersen dashes obliquely Northward , through the country , towards Bougret ;
gains Bougret , finds his German Coachman and chariot waiting there ;
cracks off , and drives undiscovered into unknown space . A deft active
man , we say ; what he undertook to do is nimbly and successfully done .

A so the Royalty of France is actually fled ? This precious night , the
shortest of the year , it flies and drives ! Baroness de Korff is , at
bottom , Dame de Tourzel , Governess of the Royal Children : she who came
hooded with the two hooded little ones ; little Dauphin ; little Madame
Royale , known long afterwards as Duchess d &apos;Angouleme . Baroness de
Korff &apos;s Waiting @-@ maid is the Queen in gypsy @-@ hat . The royal Individual in
round hat and peruke , he is Valet , for the time being . That other hooded
Dame , styled Travelling @-@ companion , is kind Sister Elizabeth ; she had
sworn , long since , when the Insurrection of Women was , that only death
should part her and them . And so they rush there , not too impetuously ,
through the Wood of Bondy : -- over a Rubicon in their own and France &apos;s
History .

Great ; though the future is all vague ! If we reach Bouille ? If we do
not reach him ? O Louis ! and this all round thee is the great slumbering
Earth ( and overhead , the great watchful Heaven ) ; the slumbering Wood
of Bondy , -- where Longhaired Childeric Donothing was struck through with
iron ; ( Henault , Abrege Chronologique , p . 36 . ) not unreasonably . These
peaked stone @-@ towers are Raincy ; towers of wicked d &apos;Orleans . All slumbers
save the multiplex rustle of our new Berline . Loose @-@ skirted scarecrow
of an Herb @-@ merchant , with his ass and early greens , toilsomely plodding ,
seems the only creature we meet . But right ahead the great North @-@ East
sends up evermore his gray brindled dawn : from dewy branch , birds here
and there , with short deep warble , salute the coming Sun . Stars fade
out , and Galaxies ; Street @-@ lamps of the City of God . The Universe , O my
brothers , is flinging wide its portals for the Levee of the GREAT HIGH
KING . Thou , poor King Louis , farest nevertheless , as mortals do , towards
Orient lands of Hope ; and the Tuileries with its Levees , and France and
the Earth itself , is but a larger kind of doghutch , -- occasionally going
rabid .



Chapter 2.4.IV.

Attitude .

But in Paris , at six in the morning ; when some Patriot Deputy , warned by
a billet , awoke Lafayette , and they went to the Tuileries ? -- Imagination
may paint , but words cannot , the surprise of Lafayette ; or with what
bewilderment helpless Gouvion rolled glassy Argus &apos;s eyes , discerning now
that his false Chambermaid told true !

However , it is to be recorded that Paris , thanks to an august National
Assembly , did , on this seeming doomsday , surpass itself . Never ,
according to Historian eye @-@ witnesses , was there seen such an &apos; imposing
attitude . &apos; ( Deux Amis , vi . 67 @-@ 178 ; Toulongeon , ii . 1 @-@ 38 ; Camille ,
Prudhomme and Editors in Hist . Parl. x . 240 @-@ 4 . ) Sections all &apos; in
permanence ; &apos; our Townhall , too , having first , about ten o &apos;clock , fired
three solemn alarm @-@ cannons : above all , our National Assembly ! National
Assembly , likewise permanent , decides what is needful ; with unanimous
consent , for the Cote Droit sits dumb , afraid of the Lanterne . Decides
with a calm promptitude , which rises towards the sublime . One must needs
vote , for the thing is self @-@ evident , that his Majesty has been abducted ,
or spirited away , &apos; enleve , &apos; by some person or persons unknown : in which
case , what will the Constitution have us do ? Let us return to first
principles , as we always say ; &quot; revenons aux principes . &quot;

By first or by second principles , much is promptly decided : Ministers
are sent for , instructed how to continue their functions ; Lafayette is
examined ; and Gouvion , who gives a most helpless account , the best he
can . Letters are found written : one Letter , of immense magnitude ; all
in his Majesty &apos;s hand , and evidently of his Majesty &apos;s own composition ;
addressed to the National Assembly . It details , with earnestness , with a
childlike simplicity , what woes his Majesty has suffered . Woes great and
small : A Necker seen applauded , a Majesty not ; then insurrection ; want
of due cash in Civil List ; general want of cash , furniture and order ;
anarchy everywhere ; Deficit never yet , in the smallest , &apos; choked or
comble : &apos; -- wherefore in brief His Majesty has retired towards a Place of
Liberty ; and , leaving Sanctions , Federation , and what Oaths there may
be , to shift for themselves , does now refer -- to what , thinks an august
Assembly ? To that &apos; Declaration of the Twenty @-@ third of June , &apos; with its
&quot; Seul il fera , He alone will make his People happy . &quot; As if that were not
buried , deep enough , under two irrevocable Twelvemonths , and the wreck
and rubbish of a whole Feudal World ! This strange autograph Letter
the National Assembly decides on printing ; on transmitting to the
Eighty @-@ three Departments , with exegetic commentary , short but pithy .
Commissioners also shall go forth on all sides ; the People be exhorted ;
the Armies be increased ; care taken that the Commonweal suffer no
damage . -- And now , with a sublime air of calmness , nay of indifference ,
we &apos; pass to the order of the day ! &apos;

By such sublime calmness , the terror of the People is calmed . These
gleaming Pike forests , which bristled fateful in the early sun ,
disappear again ; the far @-@ sounding Street @-@ orators cease , or spout milder .
We are to have a civil war ; let us have it then . The King is gone ; but
National Assembly , but France and we remain . The People also takes a
great attitude ; the People also is calm ; motionless as a couchant lion .
With but a few broolings , some waggings of the tail ; to shew what it
will do ! Cazales , for instance , was beset by street @-@ groups , and cries of
Lanterne ; but National Patrols easily delivered him . Likewise all King &apos;s
effigies and statues , at least stucco ones , get abolished . Even King &apos;s
names ; the word Roi fades suddenly out of all shop @-@ signs ; the Royal
Bengal Tiger itself , on the Boulevards , becomes the National Bengal one ,
Tigre National . ( Walpoliana . )

How great is a calm couchant People ! On the morrow , men will say to one
another : &quot; We have no King , yet we slept sound enough . &quot; On the morrow ,
fervent Achille de Chatelet , and Thomas Paine the rebellious Needleman ,
shall have the walls of Paris profusely plastered with their Placard ;
announcing that there must be a Republic ! ( Dumont , c . 16 . ) -- Need we add
that Lafayette too , though at first menaced by Pikes , has taken a great
attitude , or indeed the greatest of all ? Scouts and Aides @-@ de @-@ camp fly
forth , vague , in quest and pursuit ; young Romoeuf towards Valenciennes ,
though with small hope .

Thus Paris ; sublimely calmed , in its bereavement . But from the
Messageries Royales , in all Mail @-@ bags , radiates forth far @-@ darting the
electric news : Our Hereditary Representative is flown . Laugh , black
Royalists : yet be it in your sleeve only ; lest Patriotism notice , and
waxing frantic , lower the Lanterne ! In Paris alone is a sublime National
Assembly with its calmness ; truly , other places must take it as they
can : with open mouth and eyes ; with panic cackling , with wrath , with
conjecture . How each one of those dull leathern Diligences , with its
leathern bag and &apos; The King is fled , &apos; furrows up smooth France as it
goes ; through town and hamlet , ruffles the smooth public mind into
quivering agitation of death @-@ terror ; then lumbers on , as if nothing
had happened ! Along all highways ; towards the utmost borders ; till all
France is ruffled , -- roughened up ( metaphorically speaking ) into one
enormous , desperate @-@ minded , red @-@ guggling Turkey Cock !

For example , it is under cloud of night that the leathern Monster
reaches Nantes ; deep sunk in sleep . The word spoken rouses all Patriot
men : General Dumouriez , enveloped in roquelaures , has to descend from
his bedroom ; finds the street covered with &apos; four or five thousand
citizens in their shirts . &apos; ( Dumouriez , Memoires , ii . 109 . ) Here
and there a faint farthing rushlight , hastily kindled ; and so many
swart @-@ featured haggard faces , with nightcaps pushed back ; and the more
or less flowing drapery of night @-@ shirt : open @-@ mouthed till the General
say his word ! And overhead , as always , the Great Bear is turning so
quiet round Bootes ; steady , indifferent as the leathern Diligence
itself . Take comfort , ye men of Nantes : Bootes and the steady Bear are
turning ; ancient Atlantic still sends his brine , loud @-@ billowing , up your
Loire @-@ stream ; brandy shall be hot in the stomach : this is not the Last
of the Days , but one before the Last . -- The fools ! If they knew what
was doing , in these very instants , also by candle @-@ light , in the far
North @-@ East !

Perhaps we may say the most terrified man in Paris or France is -- who
thinks the Reader ? -- seagreen Robespierre . Double paleness , with the
shadow of gibbets and halters , overcasts the seagreen features : it is
too clear to him that there is to be &apos; a Saint @-@ Bartholomew of Patriots , &apos;
that in four @-@ and @-@ twenty hours he will not be in life . These horrid
anticipations of the soul he is heard uttering at Petion &apos;s ; by a notable
witness . By Madame Roland , namely ; her whom we saw , last year , radiant
at the Lyons Federation ! These four months , the Rolands have been in
Paris ; arranging with Assembly Committees the Municipal affairs of
Lyons , affairs all sunk in debt ; -- communing , the while , as was most
natural , with the best Patriots to be found here , with our Brissots ,
Petions , Buzots , Robespierres ; who were wont to come to us , says the
fair Hostess , four evenings in the week . They , running about , busier
than ever this day , would fain have comforted the seagreen man : spake of
Achille du Chatelet &apos;s Placard ; of a Journal to be called The Republican ;
of preparing men &apos;s minds for a Republic . &quot; A Republic ? &quot; said the
Seagreen , with one of his dry husky unsportful laughs , &quot; What is that ? &quot;
( Madame Roland , ii . 70 . ) O seagreen Incorruptible , thou shalt see !



Chapter 2.4.V.

The New Berline .

But scouts all this while and aide @-@ de @-@ camps , have flown forth faster
than the leathern Diligences . Young Romoeuf , as we said , was off early
towards Valenciennes : distracted Villagers seize him , as a traitor with
a finger of his own in the plot ; drag him back to the Townhall ; to the
National Assembly , which speedily grants a new passport . Nay now , that
same scarecrow of an Herb @-@ merchant with his ass has bethought him of the
grand new Berline seen in the Wood of Bondy ; and delivered evidence of
it : ( Moniteur , &amp; c. in Hist . Parl. x . 244 @-@ 313 . ) Romoeuf , furnished with
new passport , is sent forth with double speed on a hopefuller track ; by
Bondy , Claye , and Chalons , towards Metz , to track the new Berline ; and
gallops a franc etrier .

Miserable new Berline ! Why could not Royalty go in some old Berline
similar to that of other men ? Flying for life , one does not stickle
about his vehicle . Monsieur , in a commonplace travelling @-@ carriage is off
Northwards ; Madame , his Princess , in another , with variation of
route : they cross one another while changing horses , without look of
recognition ; and reach Flanders , no man questioning them . Precisely in
the same manner , beautiful Princess de Lamballe set off , about the same
hour ; and will reach England safe : -- would she had continued there ! The
beautiful , the good , but the unfortunate ; reserved for a frightful end !

All runs along , unmolested , speedy , except only the new Berline . Huge
leathern vehicle ; -- huge Argosy , let us say , or Acapulco @-@ ship ; with its
heavy stern @-@ boat of Chaise @-@ and @-@ pair ; with its three yellow Pilot @-@ boats
of mounted Bodyguard Couriers , rocking aimless round it and ahead of it ,
to bewilder , not to guide ! It lumbers along , lurchingly with stress , at
a snail &apos;s pace ; noted of all the world . The Bodyguard Couriers , in
their yellow liveries , go prancing and clattering ; loyal but stupid ;
unacquainted with all things . Stoppages occur ; and breakages to be
repaired at Etoges . King Louis too will dismount , will walk up hills ,
and enjoy the blessed sunshine : -- with eleven horses and double drink
money , and all furtherances of Nature and Art , it will be found that
Royalty , flying for life , accomplishes Sixty @-@ nine miles in Twenty @-@ two
incessant hours . Slow Royalty ! And yet not a minute of these hours but
is precious : on minutes hang the destinies of Royalty now .

Readers , therefore , can judge in what humour Duke de Choiseul might
stand waiting , in the Village of Pont @-@ de @-@ Sommevelle , some leagues beyond
Chalons , hour after hour , now when the day bends visibly westward .
Choiseul drove out of Paris , in all privity , ten hours before their
Majesties &apos; fixed time ; his Hussars , led by Engineer Goguelat , are here
duly , come &apos; to escort a Treasure that is expected : &apos; but , hour after
hour , is no Baroness de Korff &apos;s Berline . Indeed , over all that
North @-@ east Region , on the skirts of Champagne and of Lorraine , where the
Great Road runs , the agitation is considerable . For all along , from this
Pont @-@ de @-@ Sommevelle Northeastward as far as Montmedi , at Post @-@ villages
and Towns , escorts of Hussars and Dragoons do lounge waiting : a train or
chain of Military Escorts ; at the Montmedi end of it our brave Bouille :
an electric thunder @-@ chain ; which the invisible Bouille , like a Father
Jove , holds in his hand -- for wise purposes ! Brave Bouille has done
what man could ; has spread out his electric thunder @-@ chain of Military
Escorts , onwards to the threshold of Chalons : it waits but for the new
Korff Berline ; to receive it , escort it , and , if need be , bear it off
in whirlwind of military fire . They lie and lounge there , we say ,
these fierce Troopers ; from Montmedi and Stenai , through Clermont ,
Sainte @-@ Menehould to utmost Pont @-@ de @-@ Sommevelle , in all Post @-@ villages ;
for the route shall avoid Verdun and great Towns : they loiter impatient
&apos;till the Treasure arrive . &apos; 

Judge what a day this is for brave Bouille : perhaps the first day of
a new glorious life ; surely the last day of the old ! Also , and
indeed still more , what a day , beautiful and terrible , for your young
full @-@ blooded Captains : your Dandoins , Comte de Damas , Duke de Choiseul ,
Engineer Goguelat , and the like ; entrusted with the secret ! -- Alas , the
day bends ever more westward ; and no Korff Berline comes to sight . It
is four hours beyond the time , and still no Berline . In all
Village @-@ streets , Royalist Captains go lounging , looking often
Paris @-@ ward ; with face of unconcern , with heart full of black care :
rigorous Quartermasters can hardly keep the private dragoons from cafes
and dramshops . ( Declaration du Sieur La Gache du Regiment Royal @-@ Dragoons
in Choiseul , pp. 125 @-@ 39 . ) Dawn on our bewilderment , thou new Berline ;
dawn on us , thou Sun @-@ chariot of a new Berline , with the destinies of
France !

It was of His Majesty &apos;s ordering , this military array of Escorts : a
thing solacing the Royal imagination with a look of security and rescue ;
yet , in reality , creating only alarm , and where there was otherwise no
danger , danger without end . For each Patriot , in these Post @-@ villages ,
asks naturally : This clatter of cavalry , and marching and lounging of
troops , what means it ? To escort a Treasure ? Why escort , when no Patriot
will steal from the Nation ; or where is your Treasure ? -- There has been
such marching and counter @-@ marching : for it is another fatality , that
certain of these Military Escorts came out so early as yesterday ; the
Nineteenth not the Twentieth of the month being the day first appointed ,
which her Majesty , for some necessity or other , saw good to alter . And
now consider the suspicious nature of Patriotism ; suspicious , above
all , of Bouille the Aristocrat ; and how the sour doubting humour has had
leave to accumulate and exacerbate for four @-@ and @-@ twenty hours !

At Pont @-@ de @-@ Sommevelle , these Forty foreign Hussars of Goguelat and Duke
Choiseul are becoming an unspeakable mystery to all men . They lounged
long enough , already , at Sainte @-@ Menehould ; lounged and loitered till our
National Volunteers there , all risen into hot wrath of doubt , &apos; demanded
three hundred fusils of their Townhall , &apos; and got them . At which same
moment too , as it chanced , our Captain Dandoins was just coming in , from
Clermont with his troop , at the other end of the Village . A fresh troop ;
alarming enough ; though happily they are only Dragoons and French ! So
that Goguelat with his Hussars had to ride , and even to do it fast ;
till here at Pont @-@ de @-@ Sommevelle , where Choiseul lay waiting , he found
resting @-@ place . Resting @-@ place , as on burning marle . For the rumour of him
flies abroad ; and men run to and fro in fright and anger : Chalons sends
forth exploratory pickets , coming from Sainte @-@ Menehould , on that . What
is it , ye whiskered Hussars , men of foreign guttural speech ; in the name
of Heaven , what is it that brings you ? A Treasure ? -- exploratory pickets
shake their heads . The hungry Peasants , however , know too well what
Treasure it is : Military seizure for rents , feudalities ; which no
Bailiff could make us pay ! This they know ; -- and set to jingling their
Parish @-@ bell by way of tocsin ; with rapid effect ! Choiseul and Goguelat ,
if the whole country is not to take fire , must needs , be there Berline ,
be there no Berline , saddle and ride .

They mount ; and this Parish tocsin happily ceases . They ride slowly
Eastward , towards Sainte @-@ Menehould ; still hoping the Sun @-@ Chariot of
a Berline may overtake them . Ah me , no Berline ! And near now is that
Sainte @-@ Menehould , which expelled us in the morning , with its &apos; three
hundred National fusils ; &apos; which looks , belike , not too lovingly on
Captain Dandoins and his fresh Dragoons , though only French ; -- which ,
in a word , one dare not enter the second time , under pain of explosion !
With rather heavy heart , our Hussar Party strikes off to the left ;
through byways , through pathless hills and woods , they , avoiding
Sainte @-@ Menehould and all places which have seen them heretofore , will
make direct for the distant Village of Varennes . It is probable they
will have a rough evening @-@ ride .

This first military post , therefore , in the long thunder @-@ chain , has gone
off with no effect ; or with worse , and your chain threatens to entangle
itself ! -- The Great Road , however , is got hushed again into a kind of
quietude , though one of the wakefullest . Indolent Dragoons cannot , by
any Quartermaster , be kept altogether from the dramshop ; where Patriots
drink , and will even treat , eager enough for news . Captains , in a state
near distraction , beat the dusky highway , with a face of indifference ;
and no Sun @-@ Chariot appears . Why lingers it ? Incredible , that with eleven
horses and such yellow Couriers and furtherances , its rate should be
under the weightiest dray @-@ rate , some three miles an hour ! Alas , one
knows not whether it ever even got out of Paris ; -- and yet also one knows
not whether , this very moment , it is not at the Village @-@ end ! One &apos;s heart
flutters on the verge of unutterabilities .

Old @-@ Dragoon Drouet .

In this manner , however , has the Day bent downwards . Wearied mortals
are creeping home from their field @-@ labour ; the village @-@ artisan eats with
relish his supper of herbs , or has strolled forth to the village @-@ street
for a sweet mouthful of air and human news . Still summer @-@ eventide
everywhere ! The great Sun hangs flaming on the utmost North @-@ West ; for it
is his longest day this year . The hill @-@ tops rejoicing will ere long be
at their ruddiest , and blush Good @-@ night . The thrush , in green dells ,
on long @-@ shadowed leafy spray , pours gushing his glad serenade , to the
babble of brooks grown audibler ; silence is stealing over the Earth .
Your dusty Mill of Valmy , as all other mills and drudgeries , may furl
its canvass , and cease swashing and circling . The swenkt grinders in
this Treadmill of an Earth have ground out another Day ; and lounge
there , as we say , in village @-@ groups ; movable , or ranked on social
stone @-@ seats ; ( Rapport de M. Remy in Choiseul , p . 143 . ) their children ,
mischievous imps , sporting about their feet . Unnotable hum of sweet
human gossip rises from this Village of Sainte @-@ Menehould , as from all
other villages . Gossip mostly sweet , unnotable ; for the very Dragoons
are French and gallant ; nor as yet has the Paris @-@ and @-@ Verdun Diligence ,
with its leathern bag , rumbled in , to terrify the minds of men .

One figure nevertheless we do note at the last door of the Village : that
figure in loose @-@ flowing nightgown , of Jean Baptiste Drouet , Master of
the Post here . An acrid choleric man , rather dangerous @-@ looking ; still in
the prime of life , though he has served , in his time as a Conde Dragoon .
This day from an early hour , Drouet got his choler stirred , and has
been kept fretting . Hussar Goguelat in the morning saw good , by way
of thrift , to bargain with his own Innkeeper , not with Drouet regular
Maitre de Poste , about some gig @-@ horse for the sending back of his
gig ; which thing Drouet perceiving came over in red ire , menacing the
Inn @-@ keeper , and would not be appeased . Wholly an unsatisfactory day .
For Drouet is an acrid Patriot too , was at the Paris Feast of Pikes :
and what do these Bouille Soldiers mean ? Hussars , with their gig , and
a vengeance to it ! -- have hardly been thrust out , when Dandoins and
his fresh Dragoons arrive from Clermont , and stroll . For what purpose ?
Choleric Drouet steps out and steps in , with long @-@ flowing nightgown ;
looking abroad , with that sharpness of faculty which stirred choler
gives to man .

On the other hand , mark Captain Dandoins on the street of that same
Village ; sauntering with a face of indifference , a heart eaten of black
care ! For no Korff Berline makes its appearance . The great Sun flames
broader towards setting : one &apos;s heart flutters on the verge of dread
unutterabilities .

By Heaven ! Here is the yellow Bodyguard Courier ; spurring fast , in
the ruddy evening light ! Steady , O Dandoins , stand with inscrutable
indifferent face ; though the yellow blockhead spurs past the Post @-@ house ;
inquires to find it ; and stirs the Village , all delighted with his fine
livery . -- Lumbering along with its mountains of bandboxes , and Chaise
behind , the Korff Berline rolls in ; huge Acapulco @-@ ship with its
Cockboat , having got thus far . The eyes of the Villagers look
enlightened , as such eyes do when a coach @-@ transit , which is an event ,
occurs for them . Strolling Dragoons respectfully , so fine are the yellow
liveries , bring hand to helmet ; and a lady in gipsy @-@ hat responds with a
grace peculiar to her . ( Declaration de la Gache in Choiseul ubi supra . )
Dandoins stands with folded arms , and what look of indifference and
disdainful garrison @-@ air a man can , while the heart is like leaping out
of him . Curled disdainful moustachio ; careless glance , -- which however
surveys the Village @-@ groups , and does not like them . With his eye he
bespeaks the yellow Courier . Be quick , be quick ! Thick @-@ headed Yellow
cannot understand the eye ; comes up mumbling , to ask in words : seen of
the Village !

Nor is Post @-@ master Drouet unobservant , all this while ; but steps out and
steps in , with his long @-@ flowing nightgown , in the level sunlight ; prying
into several things . When a man &apos;s faculties , at the right time ,
are sharpened by choler , it may lead to much . That Lady in slouched
gypsy @-@ hat , though sitting back in the Carriage , does she not resemble
some one we have seen , some time ; -- at the Feast of Pikes , or elsewhere ?
And this Grosse @-@ Tete in round hat and peruke , which , looking rearward ,
pokes itself out from time to time , methinks there are features in
it -- ? Quick , Sieur Guillaume , Clerk of the Directoire , bring me a
new Assignat ! Drouet scans the new Assignat ; compares the Paper @-@ money
Picture with the Gross @-@ Head in round hat there : by Day and Night ! you
might say the one was an attempted Engraving of the other . And this
march of Troops ; this sauntering and whispering , -- I see it !

Drouet Post @-@ master of this Village , hot Patriot , Old Dragoon of Conde ,
consider , therefore , what thou wilt do . And fast : for behold the new
Berline , expeditiously yoked , cracks whipcord , and rolls away ! -- Drouet
dare not , on the spur of the instant , clutch the bridles in his own two
hands ; Dandoins , with broadsword , might hew you off . Our poor Nationals ,
not one of them here , have three hundred fusils but then no powder ;
besides one is not sure , only morally @-@ certain . Drouet , as an adroit
Old @-@ Dragoon of Conde does what is advisablest : privily bespeaks Clerk
Guillaume , Old @-@ Dragoon of Conde he too ; privily , while Clerk Guillaume
is saddling two of the fleetest horses , slips over to the Townhall to
whisper a word ; then mounts with Clerk Guillaume ; and the two bound
eastward in pursuit , to see what can be done .

They bound eastward , in sharp trot ; their moral @-@ certainty permeating
the Village , from the Townhall outwards , in busy whispers . Alas ! Captain
Dandoins orders his Dragoons to mount ; but they , complaining of long
fast , demand bread @-@ and @-@ cheese first ; -- before which brief repast can
be eaten , the whole Village is permeated ; not whispering now , but
blustering and shrieking ! National Volunteers , in hurried muster , shriek
for gunpowder ; Dragoons halt between Patriotism and Rule of the Service ,
between bread and cheese and fixed bayonets : Dandoins hands secretly his
Pocket @-@ book , with its secret despatches , to the rigorous Quartermaster :
the very Ostlers have stable @-@ forks and flails . The rigorous
Quartermaster , half @-@ saddled , cuts out his way with the sword &apos;s edge ,
amid levelled bayonets , amid Patriot vociferations , adjurations ,
flail @-@ strokes ; and rides frantic ; ( Declaration de La Gache in
Choiseul , p . 134 . ) -- few or even none following him ; the rest , so
sweetly constrained consenting to stay there .

And thus the new Berline rolls ; and Drouet and Guillaume gallop
after it , and Dandoins &apos;s Troopers or Trooper gallops after them ;
and Sainte @-@ Menehould , with some leagues of the King &apos;s Highway , is
in explosion ; -- and your Military thunder @-@ chain has gone off in a
self @-@ destructive manner ; one may fear with the frightfullest issues !



Chapter 2.4.VII.

The Night of Spurs .

This comes of mysterious Escorts , and a new Berline with eleven horses :
&apos;he that has a secret should not only hide it , but hide that he has it
to hide . &apos; Your first Military Escort has exploded self @-@ destructive ;
and all Military Escorts , and a suspicious Country will now be up ,
explosive ; comparable not to victorious thunder . Comparable , say rather ,
to the first stirring of an Alpine Avalanche ; which , once stir it , as
here at Sainte @-@ Menehould , will spread , -- all round , and on and on , as far
as Stenai ; thundering with wild ruin , till Patriot Villagers , Peasantry ,
Military Escorts , new Berline and Royalty are down , -- jumbling in the
Abyss !

The thick shades of Night are falling . Postillions crack the whip : the
Royal Berline is through Clermont , where Colonel Comte de Damas got a
word whispered to it ; is safe through , towards Varennes ; rushing at the
rate of double drink @-@ money : an Unknown &apos; Inconnu on horseback&apos;
shrieks earnestly some hoarse whisper , not audible , into the rushing
Carriage @-@ window , and vanishes , left in the night . ( Campan , ii . 159 . )
August Travellers palpitate ; nevertheless overwearied Nature sinks every
one of them into a kind of sleep . Alas , and Drouet and Clerk Guillaume
spur ; taking side @-@ roads , for shortness , for safety ; scattering abroad
that moral @-@ certainty of theirs ; which flies , a bird of the air carrying
it !

And your rigorous Quartermaster spurs ; awakening hoarse trumpet @-@ tone ,
as here at Clermont , calling out Dragoons gone to bed . Brave Colonel de
Damas has them mounted , in part , these Clermont men ; young Cornet
Remy dashes off with a few . But the Patriot Magistracy is out here at
Clermont too ; National Guards shrieking for ball @-@ cartridges ; and the
Village &apos; illuminates itself ; &apos; -- deft Patriots springing out of bed ;
alertly , in shirt or shift , striking a light ; sticking up each his
farthing candle , or penurious oil @-@ cruise , till all glitters and
glimmers ; so deft are they ! A camisado , or shirt @-@ tumult , every where :
stormbell set a @-@ ringing ; village @-@ drum beating furious generale , as
here at Clermont , under illumination ; distracted Patriots pleading and
menacing ! Brave young Colonel de Damas , in that uproar of distracted
Patriotism , speaks some fire @-@ sentences to what Troopers he has :
&quot; Comrades insulted at Sainte @-@ Menehould ; King and Country calling on
the brave ; &quot; then gives the fire @-@ word , Draw swords . Whereupon , alas , the
Troopers only smite their sword @-@ handles , driving them further home ! &quot; To
me , whoever is for the King ! &quot; cries Damas in despair ; and gallops , he
with some poor loyal Two , of the subaltern sort , into the bosom of
the Night . ( Proces @-@ verbal du Directoire de Clermont in Choiseul , p .
189 @-@ 95 . )

Night unexampled in the Clermontais ; shortest of the year ; remarkablest
of the century : Night deserving to be named of Spurs ! Cornet Remy , and
those Few he dashed off with , has missed his road ; is galloping for
hours towards Verdun ; then , for hours , across hedged country , through
roused hamlets , towards Varennes . Unlucky Cornet Remy ; unluckier Colonel
Damas , with whom there ride desperate only some loyal Two ! More ride not
of that Clermont Escort : of other Escorts , in other Villages , not even
Two may ride ; but only all curvet and prance , -- impeded by stormbell and
your Village illuminating itself .

And Drouet rides and Clerk Guillaume ; and the Country runs . -- Goguelat
and Duke Choiseul are plunging through morasses , over cliffs , over
stock and stone , in the shaggy woods of the Clermontais ; by tracks ;
or trackless , with guides ; Hussars tumbling into pitfalls , and lying
&apos;swooned three quarters of an hour , &apos; the rest refusing to march without
them . What an evening @-@ ride from Pont @-@ de @-@ Sommerville ; what a thirty
hours , since Choiseul quitted Paris , with Queen &apos;s @-@ valet Leonard in the
chaise by him ! Black Care sits behind the rider . Thus go they plunging ;
rustle the owlet from his branchy nest ; champ the sweet @-@ scented
forest @-@ herb , queen @-@ of @-@ the @-@ meadows spilling her spikenard ; and frighten
the ear of Night . But hark ! towards twelve o &apos;clock , as one guesses , for
the very stars are gone out : sound of the tocsin from Varennes ? Checking
bridle , the Hussar Officer listens : &quot; Some fire undoubtedly ! &quot; -- yet rides
on , with double breathlessness , to verify .

Yes , gallant friends that do your utmost , it is a certain sort of fire :
difficult to quench . -- The Korff Berline , fairly ahead of all this riding
Avalanche , reached the little paltry Village of Varennes about eleven
o &apos;clock ; hopeful , in spite of that horse @-@ whispering Unknown . Do not all
towns now lie behind us ; Verdun avoided , on our right ? Within wind
of Bouille himself , in a manner ; and the darkest of midsummer nights
favouring us ! And so we halt on the hill @-@ top at the South end of the
Village ; expecting our relay ; which young Bouille , Bouille &apos;s own son ,
with his Escort of Hussars , was to have ready ; for in this Village is no
Post . Distracting to think of : neither horse nor Hussar is here ! Ah ,
and stout horses , a proper relay belonging to Duke Choiseul , do stand at
hay , but in the Upper Village over the Bridge ; and we know not of them .
Hussars likewise do wait , but drinking in the taverns . For indeed it is
six hours beyond the time ; young Bouille , silly stripling , thinking
the matter over for this night , has retired to bed . And so our yellow
Couriers , inexperienced , must rove , groping , bungling , through a Village
mostly asleep : Postillions will not , for any money , go on with the tired
horses ; not at least without refreshment ; not they , let the Valet in
round hat argue as he likes .

Miserable ! &apos; For five @-@ and @-@ thirty minutes &apos; by the King &apos;s watch , the
Berline is at a dead stand ; Round @-@ hat arguing with Churnboots ; tired
horses slobbering their meal @-@ and @-@ water ; yellow Couriers groping ,
bungling ; -- young Bouille asleep , all the while , in the Upper Village ,
and Choiseul &apos;s fine team standing there at hay . No help for it ; not
with a King &apos;s ransom : the horses deliberately slobber , Round @-@ hat argues ,
Bouille sleeps . And mark now , in the thick night , do not two Horsemen ,
with jaded trot , come clank @-@ clanking ; and start with half @-@ pause , if
one noticed them , at sight of this dim mass of a Berline , and its dull
slobbering and arguing ; then prick off faster , into the Village ? It
is Drouet , he and Clerk Guillaume ! Still ahead , they two , of the whole
riding hurlyburly ; unshot , though some brag of having chased them .
Perilous is Drouet &apos;s errand also ; but he is an Old @-@ Dragoon , with his
wits shaken thoroughly awake .

The Village of Varennes lies dark and slumberous ; a most unlevel
Village , of inverse saddle @-@ shape , as men write . It sleeps ; the rushing
of the River Aire singing lullaby to it . Nevertheless from the Golden
Arms , Bras d &apos;Or Tavern , across that sloping marketplace , there still
comes shine of social light ; comes voice of rude drovers , or the like ,
who have not yet taken the stirrup @-@ cup ; Boniface Le Blanc , in white
apron , serving them : cheerful to behold . To this Bras d &apos;Or , Drouet
enters , alacrity looking through his eyes : he nudges Boniface , in all
privacy , &quot; Camarade , es tu bon Patriote , Art thou a good Patriot ? &quot; -- &quot; Si
je suis ! &quot; answers Boniface . -- &quot; In that case , &quot; eagerly whispers
Drouet -- what whisper is needful , heard of Boniface alone . ( Deux Amis ,
vi . 139 @-@ 78 . )

And now see Boniface Le Blanc bustling , as he never did for the jolliest
toper . See Drouet and Guillaume , dexterous Old @-@ Dragoons , instantly down
blocking the Bridge , with a &apos; furniture waggon they find there , &apos; with
whatever waggons , tumbrils , barrels , barrows their hands can lay hold
of ; -- till no carriage can pass . Then swiftly , the Bridge once blocked ,
see them take station hard by , under Varennes Archway : joined by Le
Blanc , Le Blanc &apos;s Brother , and one or two alert Patriots he has roused .
Some half @-@ dozen in all , with National Muskets , they stand close , waiting
under the Archway , till that same Korff Berline rumble up .

It rumbles up : Alte la ! lanterns flash out from under coat @-@ skirts ,
bridles chuck in strong fists , two National Muskets level
themselves fore and aft through the two Coach @-@ doors : &quot; Mesdames , your
Passports ? &quot; -- Alas ! Alas ! Sieur Sausse , Procureur of the
Township , Tallow @-@ chandler also and Grocer is there , with official
grocer @-@ politeness ; Drouet with fierce logic and ready wit : -- The
respected Travelling Party , be it Baroness de Korff &apos;s , or persons of
still higher consequence , will perhaps please to rest itself in M.
Sausse &apos;s till the dawn strike up !

O Louis ; O hapless Marie @-@ Antoinette , fated to pass thy life with such
men ! Phlegmatic Louis , art thou but lazy semi @-@ animate phlegm then , to
the centre of thee ? King , Captain @-@ General , Sovereign Frank ! If thy
heart ever formed , since it began beating under the name of heart , any
resolution at all , be it now then , or never in this world : &quot; Violent
nocturnal individuals , and if it were persons of high consequence ?
And if it were the King himself ? Has the King not the power , which all
beggars have , of travelling unmolested on his own Highway ? Yes : it is
the King ; and tremble ye to know it ! The King has said , in this one
small matter ; and in France , or under God &apos;s Throne , is no power that
shall gainsay . Not the King shall ye stop here under this your miserable
Archway ; but his dead body only , and answer it to Heaven and Earth . To
me , Bodyguards : Postillions , en avant ! &quot; -- One fancies in that case
the pale paralysis of these two Le Blanc musketeers ; the drooping of
Drouet &apos;s under @-@ jaw ; and how Procureur Sausse had melted like tallow
in furnace @-@ heat : Louis faring on ; in some few steps awakening
Young Bouille , awakening relays and hussars : triumphant entry , with
cavalcading high @-@ brandishing Escort , and Escorts , into Montmedi ; and the
whole course of French History different !

Alas , it was not in the poor phlegmatic man . Had it been in him , French
History had never come under this Varennes Archway to decide itself . -- He
steps out ; all step out . Procureur Sausse gives his grocer @-@ arms to the
Queen and Sister Elizabeth ; Majesty taking the two children by the hand .
And thus they walk , coolly back , over the Marketplace , to Procureur
Sausse &apos;s ; mount into his small upper story ; where straightway his
Majesty &apos; demands refreshments . &apos; Demands refreshments , as is written ;
gets bread @-@ and @-@ cheese with a bottle of Burgundy ; and remarks , that it is
the best Burgundy he ever drank !

Meanwhile , the Varennes Notables , and all men , official , and
non @-@ official , are hastily drawing on their breeches ; getting their
fighting @-@ gear . Mortals half @-@ dressed tumble out barrels , lay felled
trees ; scouts dart off to all the four winds , -- the tocsin begins
clanging , &apos; the Village illuminates itself . &apos; Very singular : how these
little Villages do manage , so adroit are they , when startled in midnight
alarm of war . Like little adroit municipal rattle @-@ snakes , suddenly
awakened : for their stormbell rattles and rings ; their eyes glisten
luminous ( with tallow @-@ light ) , as in rattle @-@ snake ire ; and the Village
will sting ! Old @-@ Dragoon Drouet is our engineer and generalissimo ;
valiant as a Ruy Diaz : -- Now or never , ye Patriots , for the Soldiery is
coming ; massacre by Austrians , by Aristocrats , wars more than civil ,
it all depends on you and the hour ! -- National Guards rank themselves ,
half @-@ buttoned : mortals , we say , still only in breeches , in
under @-@ petticoat , tumble out barrels and lumber , lay felled trees for
barricades : the Village will sting . Rabid Democracy , it would seem , is
not confined to Paris , then ? Ah no , whatsoever Courtiers might talk ; too
clearly no . This of dying for one &apos;s King is grown into a dying for one &apos;s
self , against the King , if need be .

And so our riding and running Avalanche and Hurlyburly has reached the
Abyss , Korff Berline foremost ; and may pour itself thither , and jumble :
endless ! For the next six hours , need we ask if there was a clattering
far and wide ? Clattering and tocsining and hot tumult , over all the
Clermontais , spreading through the Three Bishopricks : Dragoon and Hussar
Troops galloping on roads and no @-@ roads ; National Guards arming and
starting in the dead of night ; tocsin after tocsin transmitting the
alarm . In some forty minutes , Goguelat and Choiseul , with their wearied
Hussars , reach Varennes . Ah , it is no fire then ; or a fire difficult to
quench ! They leap the tree @-@ barricades , in spite of National serjeant ;
they enter the village , Choiseul instructing his Troopers how the matter
really is ; who respond interjectionally , in their guttural dialect ,
&quot; Der Konig ; die Koniginn ! &quot; and seem stanch . These now , in their stanch
humour , will , for one thing , beset Procureur Sausse &apos;s house . Most
beneficial : had not Drouet stormfully ordered otherwise ; and even
bellowed , in his extremity , &quot; Cannoneers to your guns ! &quot; -- two old
honey @-@ combed Field @-@ pieces , empty of all but cobwebs ; the rattle whereof ,
as the Cannoneers with assured countenance trundled them up , did
nevertheless abate the Hussar ardour , and produce a respectfuller
ranking further back . Jugs of wine , handed over the ranks , for the
German throat too has sensibility , will complete the business . When
Engineer Goguelat , some hour or so afterwards , steps forth , the response
to him is -- a hiccuping Vive la Nation !

What boots it ? Goguelat , Choiseul , now also Count Damas , and all the
Varennes Officiality are with the King ; and the King can give no order ,
form no opinion ; but sits there , as he has ever done , like clay on
potter &apos;s wheel ; perhaps the absurdest of all pitiable and pardonable
clay @-@ figures that now circle under the Moon . He will go on , next
morning , and take the National Guard with him ; Sausse permitting !
Hapless Queen : with her two children laid there on the mean bed , old
Mother Sausse kneeling to Heaven , with tears and an audible prayer , to
bless them ; imperial Marie @-@ Antoinette near kneeling to Son Sausse and
Wife Sausse , amid candle @-@ boxes and treacle @-@ barrels , -- in vain ! There
are Three @-@ thousand National Guards got in ; before long they will count
Ten @-@ thousand ; tocsins spreading like fire on dry heath , or far faster .

Young Bouille , roused by this Varennes tocsin , has taken horse ,
and -- fled towards his Father . Thitherward also rides , in an almost
hysterically desperate manner , a certain Sieur Aubriot , Choiseul &apos;s
Orderly ; swimming dark rivers , our Bridge being blocked ; spurring as if
the Hell @-@ hunt were at his heels . ( Rapport de M. Aubriot Choiseul , p .
150 @-@ 7 . ) Through the village of Dun , he , galloping still on , scatters the
alarm ; at Dun , brave Captain Deslons and his Escort of a Hundred , saddle
and ride . Deslons too gets into Varennes ; leaving his Hundred outside ,
at the tree @-@ barricade ; offers to cut King Louis out , if he will order
it : but unfortunately &quot; the work will prove hot ; &quot; whereupon King Louis
has &quot; no orders to give . &quot; ( Extrait d &apos;un Rapport de M. Deslons , Choiseul ,
p . 164 @-@ 7 . )

And so the tocsin clangs , and Dragoons gallop ; and can do nothing ,
having gallopped : National Guards stream in like the gathering of
ravens : your exploding Thunder @-@ chain , falling Avalanche , or what else we
liken it to , does play , with a vengeance , -- up now as far as Stenai
and Bouille himself . ( Bouille , ii . 74 @-@ 6 . ) Brave Bouille , son of the
whirlwind , he saddles Royal Allemand ; speaks fire @-@ words , kindling
heart and eyes ; distributes twenty @-@ five gold @-@ louis a company : -- Ride ,
Royal @-@ Allemand , long @-@ famed : no Tuileries Charge and Necker @-@ Orleans
Bust @-@ Procession ; a very King made captive , and world all to win ! -- Such
is the Night deserving to be named of Spurs .

At six o &apos;clock two things have happened . Lafayette &apos;s Aide @-@ de @-@ camp ,
Romoeuf , riding a franc etrier , on that old Herb @-@ merchant &apos;s route ,
quickened during the last stages , has got to Varennes ; where the Ten
thousand now furiously demand , with fury of panic terror , that Royalty
shall forthwith return Paris @-@ ward , that there be not infinite bloodshed .
Also , on the other side , &apos; English Tom , &apos; Choiseul &apos;s jokei , flying
with that Choiseul relay , has met Bouille on the heights of Dun ; the
adamantine brow flushed with dark thunder ; thunderous rattle of Royal
Allemand at his heels . English Tom answers as he can the brief question ,
How it is at Varennes ? -- then asks in turn what he , English Tom , with M.
de Choiseul &apos;s horses , is to do , and whither to ride ? -- To the Bottomless
Pool ! answers a thunder @-@ voice ; then again speaking and spurring , orders
Royal Allemand to the gallop ; and vanishes , swearing ( en jurant ) .
( Declaration du Sieur Thomas in Choiseul , p . 188 . ) &apos; Tis the last of
our brave Bouille . Within sight of Varennes , he having drawn bridle ,
calls a council of officers ; finds that it is in vain . King Louis has
departed , consenting : amid the clangour of universal stormbell ; amid
the tramp of Ten thousand armed men , already arrived ; and say , of Sixty
thousand flocking thither . Brave Deslons , even without &apos; orders , &apos; darted
at the River Aire with his Hundred ! ( Weber , ii . 386 . ) swam one branch
of it , could not the other ; and stood there , dripping and panting ,
with inflated nostril ; the Ten thousand answering him with a shout of
mockery , the new Berline lumbering Paris @-@ ward its weary inevitable way .
No help , then in Earth ; nor in an age , not of miracles , in Heaven !

That night , &apos; Marquis de Bouille and twenty @-@ one more of us rode over the
Frontiers ; the Bernardine monks at Orval in Luxemburg gave us supper and
lodging . &apos; ( Aubriot , ut supra , p . 158 . ) With little of speech , Bouille
rides ; with thoughts that do not brook speech . Northward , towards
uncertainty , and the Cimmerian Night : towards West @-@ Indian Isles , for
with thin Emigrant delirium the son of the whirlwind cannot act ; towards
England , towards premature Stoical death ; not towards France any
more . Honour to the Brave ; who , be it in this quarrel or in that , is
a substance and articulate @-@ speaking piece of Human Valour , not a
fanfaronading hollow Spectrum and squeaking and gibbering Shadow ! One of
the few Royalist Chief @-@ actors this Bouille , of whom so much can be said .

The brave Bouille too , then , vanishes from the tissue of our Story .
Story and tissue , faint ineffectual Emblem of that grand Miraculous
Tissue , and Living Tapestry named French Revolution , which did weave
itself then in very fact , &apos; on the loud @-@ sounding &apos; LOOM OF TIME ! &apos; The old
Brave drop out from it , with their strivings ; and new acrid Drouets , of
new strivings and colour , come in : -- as is the manner of that weaving .



Chapter 2.4.VIII.

The Return .

So then our grand Royalist Plot , of Flight to Metz , has executed itself .
Long hovering in the background , as a dread royal ultimatum , it has
rushed forward in its terrors : verily to some purpose . How many Royalist
Plots and Projects , one after another , cunningly @-@ devised , that were to
explode like powder @-@ mines and thunderclaps ; not one solitary Plot
of which has issued otherwise ! Powder @-@ mine of a Seance Royale on the
Twenty @-@ third of June 1789 , which exploded as we then said , &apos; through the
touchhole ; &apos; which next , your wargod Broglie having reloaded it , brought
a Bastille about your ears . Then came fervent Opera @-@ Repast , with
flourishing of sabres , and O Richard , O my King ; which , aided by Hunger ,
produces Insurrection of Women , and Pallas Athene in the shape of
Demoiselle Theroigne . Valour profits not ; neither has fortune smiled on
Fanfaronade . The Bouille Armament ends as the Broglie one had done . Man
after man spends himself in this cause , only to work it quicker ruin ; it
seems a cause doomed , forsaken of Earth and Heaven .

On the Sixth of October gone a year , King Louis , escorted by Demoiselle
Theroigne and some two hundred thousand , made a Royal Progress and
Entrance into Paris , such as man had never witnessed : we prophesied him
Two more such ; and accordingly another of them , after this Flight to
Metz , is now coming to pass . Theroigne will not escort here , neither
does Mirabeau now &apos; sit in one of the accompanying carriages . &apos; Mirabeau
lies dead , in the Pantheon of Great Men . Theroigne lies living , in dark
Austrian Prison ; having gone to Liege , professionally , and been seized
there . Bemurmured now by the hoarse @-@ flowing Danube ; the light of her
Patriot Supper @-@ Parties gone quite out ; so lies Theroigne : she shall
speak with the Kaiser face to face , and return . And France lies how !
Fleeting Time shears down the great and the little ; and in two years
alters many things .

But at all events , here , we say , is a second Ignominious Royal
Procession , though much altered ; to be witnessed also by its hundreds of
thousands . Patience , ye Paris Patriots ; the Royal Berline is returning .
Not till Saturday : for the Royal Berline travels by slow stages ; amid
such loud @-@ voiced confluent sea of National Guards , sixty thousand as
they count ; amid such tumult of all people . Three National @-@ Assembly
Commissioners , famed Barnave , famed Petion , generally @-@ respectable
Latour @-@ Maubourg , have gone to meet it ; of whom the two former ride in
the Berline itself beside Majesty , day after day . Latour , as a mere
respectability , and man of whom all men speak well , can ride in the
rear , with Dame Tourzel and the Soubrettes .

So on Saturday evening , about seven o &apos;clock , Paris by hundreds of
thousands is again drawn up : not now dancing the tricolor joy @-@ dance
of hope ; nor as yet dancing in fury @-@ dance of hate and revenge ; but in
silence , with vague look of conjecture and curiosity mostly scientific .
A Sainte @-@ Antoine Placard has given notice this morning that &apos; whosoever
insults Louis shall be caned , whosoever applauds him shall be hanged . &apos; 
Behold then , at last , that wonderful New Berline ; encircled by blue
National sea with fixed bayonets , which flows slowly , floating it
on , through the silent assembled hundreds of thousands . Three yellow
Couriers sit atop bound with ropes ; Petion , Barnave , their Majesties ,
with Sister Elizabeth , and the Children of France , are within .

Smile of embarrassment , or cloud of dull sourness , is on the broad
phlegmatic face of his Majesty : who keeps declaring to the successive
Official @-@ persons , what is evident , &quot; Eh bien , me voila , Well , here you
have me ; &quot; and what is not evident , &quot; I do assure you I did not mean to
pass the frontiers ; &quot; and so forth : speeches natural for that poor Royal
man ; which Decency would veil . Silent is her Majesty , with a look of
grief and scorn ; natural for that Royal Woman . Thus lumbers and
creeps the ignominious Royal Procession , through many streets , amid a
silent @-@ gazing people : comparable , Mercier thinks , ( Nouveau Paris , iii .
22 . ) to some Procession de Roi de Bazoche ; or say , Procession of
King Crispin , with his Dukes of Sutor @-@ mania and royal blazonry of
Cordwainery . Except indeed that this is not comic ; ah no , it is
comico @-@ tragic ; with bound Couriers , and a Doom hanging over it ; most
fantastic , yet most miserably real . Miserablest flebile ludibrium of a
Pickleherring Tragedy ! It sweeps along there , in most ungorgeous pall ,
through many streets , in the dusty summer evening ; gets itself at length
wriggled out of sight ; vanishing in the Tuileries Palace -- towards its
doom , of slow torture , peine forte et dure .

Populace , it is true , seizes the three rope @-@ bound yellow Couriers ; will
at least massacre them . But our august Assembly , which is sitting at
this great moment , sends out Deputation of rescue ; and the whole is
got huddled up . Barnave , &apos; all dusty , &apos; is already there , in the National
Hall ; making brief discreet address and report . As indeed , through the
whole journey , this Barnave has been most discreet , sympathetic ; and has
gained the Queen &apos;s trust , whose noble instinct teaches her always who
is to be trusted . Very different from heavy Petion ; who , if Campan speak
truth , ate his luncheon , comfortably filled his wine @-@ glass , in the Royal
Berline ; flung out his chicken @-@ bones past the nose of Royalty itself ;
and , on the King &apos;s saying &quot; France cannot be a Republic , &quot; answered &quot; No ,
it is not ripe yet . &quot; Barnave is henceforth a Queen &apos;s adviser , if advice
could profit : and her Majesty astonishes Dame Campan by signifying
almost a regard for Barnave : and that , in a day of retribution and Royal
triumph , Barnave shall not be executed . ( Campan , ii. c . 18 . )

On Monday night Royalty went ; on Saturday evening it returns : so
much , within one short week , has Royalty accomplished for itself . The
Pickleherring Tragedy has vanished in the Tuileries Palace , towards
&apos;pain strong and hard . &apos; Watched , fettered , and humbled , as Royalty never
was . Watched even in its sleeping @-@ apartments and inmost recesses : for it
has to sleep with door set ajar , blue National Argus watching , his eye
fixed on the Queen &apos;s curtains ; nay , on one occasion , as the Queen cannot
sleep , he offers to sit by her pillow , and converse a little ! ( Ibid. ii .
149 . )



Chapter 2.4.IX.

Sharp Shot .

In regard to all which , this most pressing question arises : What is
to be done with it ? &quot; Depose it ! &quot; resolutely answer Robespierre and the
thoroughgoing few . For truly , with a King who runs away , and needs to be
watched in his very bedroom that he may stay and govern you , what other
reasonable thing can be done ? Had Philippe d &apos;Orleans not been a caput
mortuum ! But of him , known as one defunct , no man now dreams . &quot; Depose it
not ; say that it is inviolable , that it was spirited away , was enleve ;
at any cost of sophistry and solecism , reestablish it ! &quot; so answer with
loud vehemence all manner of Constitutional Royalists ; as all your Pure
Royalists do naturally likewise , with low vehemence , and rage compressed
by fear , still more passionately answer . Nay Barnave and the two
Lameths , and what will follow them , do likewise answer so . Answer , with
their whole might : terror @-@ struck at the unknown Abysses on the verge
of which , driven thither by themselves mainly , all now reels , ready to
plunge .

By mighty effort and combination this latter course , of reestablish it ,
is the course fixed on ; and it shall by the strong arm , if not by
the clearest logic , be made good . With the sacrifice of all their
hard @-@ earned popularity , this notable Triumvirate , says Toulongeon , &apos; set
the Throne up again , which they had so toiled to overturn : as one might
set up an overturned pyramid , on its vertex ; to stand so long as it is
held . &apos; 

Unhappy France ; unhappy in King , Queen , and Constitution ; one knows
not in which unhappiest ! Was the meaning of our so glorious French
Revolution this , and no other , That when Shams and Delusions , long
soul @-@ killing , had become body @-@ killing , and got the length of Bankruptcy
and Inanition , a great People rose and , with one voice , said , in the
Name of the Highest : Shams shall be no more ? So many sorrows and bloody
horrors , endured , and to be yet endured through dismal coming centuries ,
were they not the heavy price paid and payable for this same : Total
Destruction of Shams from among men ? And now , O Barnave Triumvirate ! is
it in such double @-@ distilled Delusion , and Sham even of a Sham , that
an Effort of this kind will rest acquiescent ? Messieurs of the popular
Triumvirate : Never ! But , after all , what can poor popular Triumvirates
and fallible august Senators do ? They can , when the Truth is all
too @-@ horrible , stick their heads ostrich @-@ like into what sheltering
Fallacy is nearest : and wait there , a posteriori !

Readers who saw the Clermontais and Three @-@ Bishopricks gallop , in the
Night of Spurs ; Diligences ruffling up all France into one terrific
terrified Cock of India ; and the Town of Nantes in its shirt , -- may fancy
what an affair to settle this was . Robespierre , on the extreme Left ,
with perhaps Petion and lean old Goupil , for the very Triumvirate has
defalcated , are shrieking hoarse ; drowned in Constitutional clamour .
But the debate and arguing of a whole Nation ; the bellowings through
all Journals , for and against ; the reverberant voice of Danton ;
the Hyperion @-@ shafts of Camille ; the porcupine @-@ quills of implacable
Marat : -- conceive all this .

Constitutionalists in a body , as we often predicted , do now recede
from the Mother Society , and become Feuillans ; threatening her with
inanition , the rank and respectability being mostly gone . Petition after
Petition , forwarded by Post , or borne in Deputation , comes praying for
Judgment and Decheance , which is our name for Deposition ; praying , at
lowest , for Reference to the Eighty @-@ three Departments of France . Hot
Marseillese Deputation comes declaring , among other things : &quot; Our Phocean
Ancestors flung a Bar of Iron into the Bay at their first landing ; this
Bar will float again on the Mediterranean brine before we consent to be
slaves . &quot; All this for four weeks or more , while the matter still hangs
doubtful ; Emigration streaming with double violence over the frontiers ;
( Bouille , ii . 101 . ) France seething in fierce agitation of this question
and prize @-@ question : What is to be done with the fugitive Hereditary
Representative ?

Finally , on Friday the 15th of July 1791 , the National Assembly decides ;
in what negatory manner we know . Whereupon the Theatres all close , the
Bourne @-@ stones and Portable @-@ chairs begin spouting , Municipal Placards
flaming on the walls , and Proclamations published by sound of trumpet ,
&apos;invite to repose ; &apos; with small effect . And so , on Sunday the 17th , there
shall be a thing seen , worthy of remembering . Scroll of a Petition ,
drawn up by Brissots , Dantons , by Cordeliers , Jacobins ; for the thing
was infinitely shaken and manipulated , and many had a hand in it : such
Scroll lies now visible , on the wooden framework of the Fatherland &apos;s
Altar , for signature . Unworking Paris , male and female , is crowding
thither , all day , to sign or to see . Our fair Roland herself the eye of
History can discern there , &apos; in the morning ; &apos; ( Madame Roland , ii . 74 . )
not without interest . In few weeks the fair Patriot will quit Paris ; yet
perhaps only to return .

But , what with sorrow of baulked Patriotism , what with closed theatres ,
and Proclamations still publishing themselves by sound of trumpet , the
fervour of men &apos;s minds , this day , is great . Nay , over and above , there
has fallen out an incident , of the nature of Farce @-@ Tragedy and Riddle ;
enough to stimulate all creatures . Early in the day , a Patriot ( or some
say , it was a Patriotess , and indeed Truth is undiscoverable ) , while
standing on the firm deal @-@ board of Fatherland &apos;s Altar , feels suddenly ,
with indescribable torpedo @-@ shock of amazement , his bootsole pricked
through from below ; he clutches up suddenly this electrified bootsole
and foot ; discerns next instant -- the point of a gimlet or brad @-@ awl
playing up , through the firm deal @-@ board , and now hastily drawing itself
back ! Mystery , perhaps Treason ? The wooden frame @-@ work is impetuously
broken up ; and behold , verily a mystery ; never explicable fully to the
end of the world ! Two human individuals , of mean aspect , one of them
with a wooden leg , lie ensconced there , gimlet in hand : they must have
come in overnight ; they have a supply of provisions , -- no &apos; barrel of
gunpowder &apos; that one can see ; they affect to be asleep ; look blank
enough , and give the lamest account of themselves . &quot; Mere curiosity ; they
were boring up to get an eye @-@ hole ; to see , perhaps &apos; with lubricity , &apos;
whatsoever , from that new point of vision , could be seen : &quot; -- little that
was edifying , one would think ! But indeed what stupidest thing may not
human Dulness , Pruriency , Lubricity , Chance and the Devil , choosing Two
out of Half @-@ a @-@ million idle human heads , tempt them to ? ( Hist . Parl. xi .
104 @-@ 7 . )

Sure enough , the two human individuals with their gimlet are there .
Ill @-@ starred pair of individuals ! For the result of it all is that
Patriotism , fretting itself , in this state of nervous excitability ,
with hypotheses , suspicions and reports , keeps questioning these two
distracted human individuals , and again questioning them ; claps them
into the nearest Guardhouse , clutches them out again ; one hypothetic
group snatching them from another : till finally , in such extreme state
of nervous excitability , Patriotism hangs them as spies of Sieur Motier ;
and the life and secret is choked out of them forevermore . Forevermore ,
alas ! Or is a day to be looked for when these two evidently mean
individuals , who are human nevertheless , will become Historical Riddles ;
and , like him of the Iron Mask ( also a human individual , and evidently
nothing more ) , -- have their Dissertations ? To us this only is certain ,
that they had a gimlet , provisions and a wooden leg ; and have died there
on the Lanterne , as the unluckiest fools might die .

And so the signature goes on , in a still more excited manner . And
Chaumette , for Antiquarians possess the very Paper to this hour , ( Ibid .
xi . 113 , &amp; c . ) -- has signed himself &apos; in a flowing saucy hand slightly
leaned ; &apos; and Hebert , detestable Pere Duchene , as if &apos; an inked spider had
dropped on the paper ; &apos; Usher Maillard also has signed , and many Crosses ,
which cannot write . And Paris , through its thousand avenues , is welling
to the Champ @-@ de @-@ Mars and from it , in the utmost excitability of humour ;
central Fatherland &apos;s Altar quite heaped with signing Patriots and
Patriotesses ; the Thirty @-@ benches and whole internal Space crowded with
onlookers , with comers and goers ; one regurgitating whirlpool of men and
women in their Sunday clothes . All which a Constitutional Sieur Motier
sees ; and Bailly , looking into it with his long visage made still
longer . Auguring no good ; perhaps Decheance and Deposition after all !
Stop it , ye Constitutional Patriots ; fire itself is quenchable , yet only
quenchable at first !

Stop it , truly : but how stop it ? Have not the first Free People of the
Universe a right to petition ? -- Happily , if also unhappily , here is one
proof of riot : these two human individuals , hanged at the Lanterne .
Proof , O treacherous Sieur Motier ? Were they not two human individuals
sent thither by thee to be hanged ; to be a pretext for thy bloody
Drapeau Rouge ? This question shall many a Patriot , one day , ask ; and
answer affirmatively , strong in Preternatural Suspicion .

Enough , towards half past seven in the evening , the mere natural eye
can behold this thing : Sieur Motier , with Municipals in scarf , with blue
National Patrollotism , rank after rank , to the clang of drums ; wending
resolutely to the Champ @-@ de @-@ Mars ; Mayor Bailly , with elongated visage ,
bearing , as in sad duty bound , the Drapeau Rouge ! Howl of angry derision
rises in treble and bass from a hundred thousand throats , at the sight
of Martial Law ; which nevertheless waving its Red sanguinary Flag ,
advances there , from the Gros @-@ Caillou Entrance ; advances , drumming
and waving , towards Altar of Fatherland . Amid still wilder howls , with
objurgation , obtestation ; with flights of pebbles and mud , saxa et
faeces ; with crackle of a pistol @-@ shot ; -- finally with volley @-@ fire of
Patrollotism ; levelled muskets ; roll of volley on volley ! Precisely
after one year and three days , our sublime Federation Field is wetted ,
in this manner , with French blood .

Some &apos; Twelve unfortunately shot , &apos; reports Bailly , counting by units ; but
Patriotism counts by tens and even by hundreds . Not to be forgotten ,
nor forgiven ! Patriotism flies , shrieking , execrating . Camille ceases
Journalising , this day ; great Danton with Camille and Freron have taken
wing , for their life ; Marat burrows deep in the Earth , and is silent .
Once more Patrollotism has triumphed : one other time ; but it is the
last .

This was the Royal Flight to Varennes . Thus was the Throne overturned
thereby ; but thus also was it victoriously set up again -- on its vertex ;
and will stand while it can be held .

PARLIAMENT FIRST


Chapter 2.5.I.

Grande Acceptation .

In the last nights of September , when the autumnal equinox is past ,
and grey September fades into brown October , why are the Champs Elysees
illuminated ; why is Paris dancing , and flinging fire @-@ works ? They are
gala @-@ nights , these last of September ; Paris may well dance , and the
Universe : the Edifice of the Constitution is completed ! Completed ; nay
revised , to see that there was nothing insufficient in it ; solemnly
proferred to his Majesty ; solemnly accepted by him , to the sound
of cannon @-@ salvoes , on the fourteenth of the month . And now by such
illumination , jubilee , dancing and fire @-@ working , do we joyously handsel
the new Social Edifice , and first raise heat and reek there , in the name
of Hope .

The Revision , especially with a throne standing on its vertex , has
been a work of difficulty , of delicacy . In the way of propping and
buttressing , so indispensable now , something could be done ; and yet ,
as is feared , not enough . A repentant Barnave Triumvirate , our Rabauts ,
Duports , Thourets , and indeed all Constitutional Deputies did strain
every nerve : but the Extreme Left was so noisy ; the People were so
suspicious , clamorous to have the work ended : and then the loyal Right
Side sat feeble petulant all the while , and as it were , pouting and
petting ; unable to help , had they even been willing ; the two Hundred and
Ninety had solemnly made scission , before that : and departed , shaking
the dust off their feet . To such transcendency of fret , and desperate
hope that worsening of the bad might the sooner end it and bring back
the good , had our unfortunate loyal Right Side now come ! ( Toulongeon ,
ii . 56 , 59 . )

However , one finds that this and the other little prop has been added ,
where possibility allowed . Civil @-@ list and Privy @-@ purse were from of old
well cared for . King &apos;s Constitutional Guard , Eighteen hundred loyal men
from the Eighty @-@ three Departments , under a loyal Duke de Brissac ; this ,
with trustworthy Swiss besides , is of itself something . The old loyal
Bodyguards are indeed dissolved , in name as well as in fact ; and gone
mostly towards Coblentz . But now also those Sansculottic violent Gardes
Francaises , or Centre Grenadiers , shall have their mittimus : they do
ere long , in the Journals , not without a hoarse pathos , publish their
Farewell ; &apos; wishing all Aristocrats the graves in Paris which to us are
denied . &apos; ( Hist . Parl. xiii . 73 . ) They depart , these first Soldiers of
the Revolution ; they hover very dimly in the distance for about another
year ; till they can be remodelled , new @-@ named , and sent to fight the
Austrians ; and then History beholds them no more . A most notable Corps
of men ; which has its place in World @-@ History ; -- though to us , so is
History written , they remain mere rubrics of men ; nameless ; a shaggy
Grenadier Mass , crossed with buff @-@ belts . And yet might we not ask : What
Argonauts , what Leonidas &apos; Spartans had done such a work ? Think of
their destiny : since that May morning , some three years ago , when they ,
unparticipating , trundled off d &apos;Espremenil to the Calypso Isles ; since
that July evening , some two years ago , when they , participating and
sacreing with knit brows , poured a volley into Besenval &apos;s Prince de
Lambesc ! History waves them her mute adieu .

So that the Sovereign Power , these Sansculottic Watchdogs , more like
wolves , being leashed and led away from his Tuileries , breathes
freer . The Sovereign Power is guarded henceforth by a loyal Eighteen
hundred , -- whom Contrivance , under various pretexts , may gradually swell
to Six thousand ; who will hinder no Journey to Saint @-@ Cloud . The sad
Varennes business has been soldered up ; cemented , even in the blood of
the Champ @-@ de @-@ Mars , these two months and more ; and indeed ever since ,
as formerly , Majesty has had its privileges , its &apos; choice of residence , &apos;
though , for good reasons , the royal mind &apos; prefers continuing in Paris . &apos; 
Poor royal mind , poor Paris ; that have to go mumming ; enveloped in
speciosities , in falsehood which knows itself false ; and to enact
mutually your sorrowful farce @-@ tragedy , being bound to it ; and on the
whole , to hope always , in spite of hope !

Nay , now that his Majesty has accepted the Constitution , to the sound of
cannon @-@ salvoes , who would not hope ? Our good King was misguided but he
meant well . Lafayette has moved for an Amnesty , for universal forgiving
and forgetting of Revolutionary faults ; and now surely the glorious
Revolution cleared of its rubbish , is complete ! Strange enough , and
touching in several ways , the old cry of Vive le Roi once more rises
round King Louis the Hereditary Representative . Their Majesties went
to the Opera ; gave money to the Poor : the Queen herself , now when the
Constitution is accepted , hears voice of cheering . Bygone shall be
bygone ; the New Era shall begin ! To and fro , amid those lamp @-@ galaxies
of the Elysian Fields , the Royal Carriage slowly wends and rolls ; every
where with vivats , from a multitude striving to be glad . Louis
looks out , mainly on the variegated lamps and gay human groups , with
satisfaction enough for the hour . In her Majesty &apos;s face , &apos; under
that kind graceful smile a deep sadness is legible . &apos; ( De Stael ,
Considerations , i. c . 23 . ) Brilliancies , of valour and of wit , stroll
here observant : a Dame de Stael , leaning most probably on the arm of
her Narbonne . She meets Deputies ; who have built this Constitution ; who
saunter here with vague communings , -- not without thoughts whether it
will stand . But as yet melodious fiddlestrings twang and warble every
where , with the rhythm of light fantastic feet ; long lamp @-@ galaxies
fling their coloured radiance ; and brass @-@ lunged Hawkers elbow and bawl ,
&quot; Grande Acceptation , Constitution Monarchique : &quot; it behoves the Son of
Adam to hope . Have not Lafayette , Barnave , and all Constitutionalists
set their shoulders handsomely to the inverted pyramid of a throne ?
Feuillans , including almost the whole Constitutional Respectability
of France , perorate nightly from their tribune ; correspond through all
Post @-@ offices ; denouncing unquiet Jacobinism ; trusting well that its time
is nigh done . Much is uncertain , questionable : but if the Hereditary
Representative be wise and lucky , may one not , with a sanguine Gaelic
temper , hope that he will get in motion better or worse ; that what is
wanting to him will gradually be gained and added ?

For the rest , as we must repeat , in this building of the Constitutional
Fabric , especially in this Revision of it , nothing that one could
think of to give it new strength , especially to steady it , to give it
permanence , and even eternity , has been forgotten . Biennial Parliament ,
to be called Legislative , Assemblee Legislative ; with Seven Hundred
and Forty @-@ five Members , chosen in a judicious manner by the &apos; active
citizens &apos; alone , and even by electing of electors still more active :
this , with privileges of Parliament shall meet , self @-@ authorized if need
be , and self @-@ dissolved ; shall grant money @-@ supplies and talk ; watch over
the administration and authorities ; discharge for ever the functions
of a Constitutional Great Council , Collective Wisdom , and National
Palaver , -- as the Heavens will enable . Our First biennial Parliament ,
which indeed has been a @-@ choosing since early in August , is now as good
as chosen . Nay it has mostly got to Paris : it arrived gradually ; -- not
without pathetic greeting to its venerable Parent , the now moribund
Constituent ; and sat there in the Galleries , reverently listening ; ready
to begin , the instant the ground were clear .

Then as to changes in the Constitution itself ? This , impossible for any
Legislative , or common biennial Parliament , and possible solely for some
resuscitated Constituent or National Convention , -- is evidently one of
the most ticklish points . The august moribund Assembly debated it for
four entire days . Some thought a change , or at least reviewal and new
approval , might be admissible in thirty years ; some even went lower ,
down to twenty , nay to fifteen . The august Assembly had once decided for
thirty years ; but it revoked that , on better thoughts ; and did not
fix any date of time , but merely some vague outline of a posture of
circumstances , and on the whole left the matter hanging . ( Choix de
Rapports , &amp; c . ( Paris , 1825 ) , vi . 239 @-@ 317 . ) Doubtless a National
Convention can be assembled even within the thirty years : yet one may
hope , not ; but that Legislatives , biennial Parliaments of the common
kind , with their limited faculty , and perhaps quiet successive additions
thereto , may suffice , for generations , or indeed while computed Time
runs .

Furthermore , be it noted that no member of this Constituent has been ,
or could be , elected to the new Legislative . So noble @-@ minded were
these Law @-@ makers ! cry some : and Solon @-@ like would banish themselves . So
splenetic ! cry more : each grudging the other , none daring to be outdone
in self @-@ denial by the other . So unwise in either case ! answer all
practical men . But consider this other self @-@ denying ordinance , That none
of us can be King &apos;s Minister , or accept the smallest Court Appointment ,
for the space of four , or at lowest ( and on long debate and Revision ) ,
for the space of two years ! So moves the incorruptible seagreen
Robespierre ; with cheap magnanimity he ; and none dare be outdone by him .
It was such a law , not so superfluous then , that sent Mirabeau to the
Gardens of Saint @-@ Cloud , under cloak of darkness , to that colloquy of
the gods ; and thwarted many things . Happily and unhappily there is no
Mirabeau now to thwart .

Welcomer meanwhile , welcome surely to all right hearts , is Lafayette &apos;s
chivalrous Amnesty . Welcome too is that hard @-@ wrung Union of Avignon ;
which has cost us , first and last , &apos; thirty sessions of debate , &apos; and so
much else : may it at length prove lucky ! Rousseau &apos;s statue is decreed :
virtuous Jean @-@ Jacques , Evangelist of the Contrat Social . Not Drouet of
Varennes ; nor worthy Lataille , master of the old world @-@ famous Tennis
Court in Versailles , is forgotten ; but each has his honourable mention ,
and due reward in money . ( Moniteur in Hist . Parl. xi . 473 . ) Whereupon ,
things being all so neatly winded up , and the Deputations , and Messages ,
and royal and other Ceremonials having rustled by ; and the King having
now affectionately perorated about peace and tranquilisation ,
and members having answered &quot; Oui ! oui ! &quot; with effusion , even with
tears , -- President Thouret , he of the Law Reforms , rises , and , with
a strong voice , utters these memorable last @-@ words : &quot; The National
Constituent Assembly declares that it has finished its mission ; and that
its sittings are all ended . &quot; Incorruptible Robespierre , virtuous Petion
are borne home on the shoulders of the people ; with vivats heaven @-@ high .
The rest glide quietly to their respective places of abode . It is
the last afternoon of September , 1791 ; on the morrow morning the new
Legislative will begin .

So , amid glitter of illuminated streets and Champs Elysees , and crackle
of fireworks and glad deray , has the first National Assembly vanished ;
dissolving , as they well say , into blank Time ; and is no more . National
Assembly is gone , its work remaining ; as all Bodies of men go , and as
man himself goes : it had its beginning , and must likewise have its end .
A Phantasm @-@ Reality born of Time , as the rest of us are ; flitting ever
backwards now on the tide of Time : to be long remembered of men . Very
strange Assemblages , Sanhedrims , Amphictyonics , Trades Unions , Ecumenic
Councils , Parliaments and Congresses , have met together on this
Planet , and dispersed again ; but a stranger Assemblage than this august
Constituent , or with a stranger mission , perhaps never met there . Seen
from the distance , this also will be a miracle . Twelve Hundred human
individuals , with the Gospel of Jean @-@ Jacques Rousseau in their pocket ,
congregating in the name of Twenty @-@ five Millions , with full assurance of
faith , to &apos; make the Constitution : &apos; such sight , the acme and main product
of the Eighteenth Century , our World can witness once only . For Time is
rich in wonders , in monstrosities most rich ; and is observed never to
repeat himself , or any of his Gospels : -- surely least of all , this Gospel
according to Jean @-@ Jacques . Once it was right and indispensable , since
such had become the Belief of men ; but once also is enough .

They have made the Constitution , these Twelve Hundred Jean @-@ Jacques
Evangelists ; not without result . Near twenty @-@ nine months they sat ,
with various fortune ; in various capacity ; -- always , we may say , in that
capacity of carborne Caroccio , and miraculous Standard of the Revolt of
Men , as a Thing high and lifted up ; whereon whosoever looked might hope
healing . They have seen much : cannons levelled on them ; then suddenly ,
by interposition of the Powers , the cannons drawn back ; and a war @-@ god
Broglie vanishing , in thunder not his own , amid the dust and downrushing
of a Bastille and Old Feudal France . They have suffered somewhat : Royal
Session , with rain and Oath of the Tennis @-@ Court ; Nights of Pentecost ;
Insurrections of Women . Also have they not done somewhat ? Made the
Constitution , and managed all things the while ; passed , in these
twenty @-@ nine months , &apos; twenty @-@ five hundred Decrees , &apos; which on the average
is some three for each day , including Sundays ! Brevity , one finds , is
possible , at times : had not Moreau de St. Mery to give three thousand
orders before rising from his seat ? -- There was valour ( or value ) in
these men ; and a kind of faith , -- were it only faith in this , That
cobwebs are not cloth ; that a Constitution could be made . Cobwebs
and chimeras ought verily to disappear ; for a Reality there is . Let
formulas , soul @-@ killing , and now grown body @-@ killing , insupportable ,
begone , in the name of Heaven and Earth ! -- Time , as we say , brought forth
these Twelve Hundred ; Eternity was before them , Eternity behind : they
worked , as we all do , in the confluence of Two Eternities ; what work was
given them . Say not that it was nothing they did . Consciously they
did somewhat ; unconsciously how much ! They had their giants and their
dwarfs , they accomplished their good and their evil ; they are gone ,
and return no more . Shall they not go with our blessing , in these
circumstances ; with our mild farewell ?

By post , by diligence , on saddle or sole ; they are gone : towards the
four winds ! Not a few over the marches , to rank at Coblentz . Thither
wended Maury , among others ; but in the end towards Rome , -- to be clothed
there in red Cardinal plush ; in falsehood as in a garment ; pet son ( her
last @-@ born ? ) of the Scarlet Woman . Talleyrand @-@ Perigord , excommunicated
Constitutional Bishop , will make his way to London ; to be Ambassador ,
spite of the Self @-@ denying Law ; brisk young Marquis Chauvelin acting
as Ambassador &apos;s @-@ Cloak . In London too , one finds Petion the virtuous ;
harangued and haranguing , pledging the wine @-@ cup with Constitutional
Reform Clubs , in solemn tavern @-@ dinner . Incorruptible Robespierre retires
for a little to native Arras : seven short weeks of quiet ; the last
appointed him in this world . Public Accuser in the Paris Department ,
acknowledged highpriest of the Jacobins ; the glass of incorruptible thin
Patriotism , for his narrow emphasis is loved of all the narrow , -- this
man seems to be rising , somewhither ? He sells his small heritage at
Arras ; accompanied by a Brother and a Sister , he returns , scheming out
with resolute timidity a small sure destiny for himself and them , to
his old lodging , at the Cabinet @-@ maker &apos;s , in the Rue St. Honore : -- O
resolute @-@ tremulous incorruptible seagreen man , towards what a destiny !

Lafayette , for his part , will lay down the command . He retires
Cincinnatus @-@ like to his hearth and farm ; but soon leaves them again . Our
National Guard , however , shall henceforth have no one Commandant ; but
all Colonels shall command in succession , month about . Other Deputies we
have met , or Dame de Stael has met , &apos; sauntering in a thoughtful manner ; &apos;
perhaps uncertain what to do . Some , as Barnave , the Lameths , and
their Duport , will continue here in Paris : watching the new biennial
Legislative , Parliament the First ; teaching it to walk , if so might be ;
and the Court to lead it .

Thus these : sauntering in a thoughtful manner ; travelling by post
or diligence , -- whither Fate beckons . Giant Mirabeau slumbers in the
Pantheon of Great Men : and France ? and Europe ? -- The brass @-@ lunged Hawkers
sing &quot; Grand Acceptation , Monarchic Constitution &quot; through these gay
crowds : the Morrow , grandson of Yesterday , must be what it can , as
To @-@ day its father is . Our new biennial Legislative begins to constitute
itself on the first of October , 1791 .



Chapter 2.5.II.

The Book of the Law .

If the august Constituent Assembly itself , fixing the regards of
the Universe , could , at the present distance of time and place , gain
comparatively small attention from us , how much less can this poor
Legislative ! It has its Right Side and its Left ; the less Patriotic and
the more , for Aristocrats exist not here or now : it spouts and speaks :
listens to Reports , reads Bills and Laws ; works in its vocation , for a
season : but the history of France , one finds , is seldom or never there .
Unhappy Legislative , what can History do with it ; if not drop a tear
over it , almost in silence ? First of the two @-@ year Parliaments of France ,
which , if Paper Constitution and oft @-@ repeated National Oath could avail
aught , were to follow in softly @-@ strong indissoluble sequence while Time
ran , -- it had to vanish dolefully within one year ; and there came no
second like it . Alas ! your biennial Parliaments in endless indissoluble
sequence ; they , and all that Constitutional Fabric , built with such
explosive Federation Oaths , and its top @-@ stone brought out with dancing
and variegated radiance , went to pieces , like frail crockery , in the
crash of things ; and already , in eleven short months , were in that Limbo
near the Moon , with the ghosts of other Chimeras . There , except for rare
specific purposes , let them rest , in melancholy peace .

On the whole , how unknown is a man to himself ; or a public Body of men
to itself ! Aesop &apos;s fly sat on the chariot @-@ wheel , exclaiming , What a dust
I do raise ! Great Governors , clad in purple with fasces and insignia ,
are governed by their valets , by the pouting of their women and
children ; or , in Constitutional countries , by the paragraphs of their
Able Editors . Say not , I am this or that ; I am doing this or that ! For
thou knowest it not , thou knowest only the name it as yet goes by . A
purple Nebuchadnezzar rejoices to feel himself now verily Emperor
of this great Babylon which he has builded ; and is a nondescript
biped @-@ quadruped , on the eve of a seven @-@ years course of grazing ! These
Seven Hundred and Forty @-@ five elected individuals doubt not but they are
the First biennial Parliament , come to govern France by parliamentary
eloquence : and they are what ? And they have come to do what ? Things
foolish and not wise !

It is much lamented by many that this First Biennial had no members
of the old Constituent in it , with their experience of parties and
parliamentary tactics ; that such was their foolish Self @-@ denying Law .
Most surely , old members of the Constituent had been welcome to us here .
But , on the other hand , what old or what new members of any Constituent
under the Sun could have effectually profited ? There are First biennial
Parliaments so postured as to be , in a sense , beyond wisdom ; where
wisdom and folly differ only in degree , and wreckage and dissolution are
the appointed issue for both .

Old @-@ Constituents , your Barnaves , Lameths and the like , for whom a
special Gallery has been set apart , where they may sit in honour
and listen , are in the habit of sneering at these new Legislators ;
( Dumouriez , ii . 150 , &amp; c . ) but let not us ! The poor Seven Hundred and
Forty @-@ five , sent together by the active citizens of France , are what
they could be ; do what is fated them . That they are of Patriot temper we
can well understand . Aristocrat Noblesse had fled over the marches , or
sat brooding silent in their unburnt Chateaus ; small prospect had they
in Primary Electoral Assemblies . What with Flights to Varennes , what
with Days of Poniards , with plot after plot , the People are left to
themselves ; the People must needs choose Defenders of the People , such
as can be had . Choosing , as they also will ever do , &apos; if not the ablest
man , yet the man ablest to be chosen ! &apos; Fervour of character , decided
Patriot @-@ Constitutional feeling ; these are qualities : but free
utterance , mastership in tongue @-@ fence ; this is the quality of qualities .
Accordingly one finds , with little astonishment , in this First Biennial ,
that as many as Four hundred Members are of the Advocate or Attorney
species . Men who can speak , if there be aught to speak : nay here are
men also who can think , and even act . Candour will say of this ill @-@ fated
First French Parliament that it wanted not its modicum of talent , its
modicum of honesty ; that it , neither in the one respect nor in the
other , sank below the average of Parliaments , but rose above the
average . Let average Parliaments , whom the world does not guillotine ,
and cast forth to long infamy , be thankful not to themselves but to
their stars !

France , as we say , has once more done what it could : fervid men have
come together from wide separation ; for strange issues . Fiery Max Isnard
is come , from the utmost South @-@ East ; fiery Claude Fauchet , Te @-@ Deum
Fauchet Bishop of Calvados , from the utmost North @-@ West . No Mirabeau now
sits here , who had swallowed formulas : our only Mirabeau now is
Danton , working as yet out of doors ; whom some call &apos; Mirabeau of the
Sansculottes . &apos; 

Nevertheless we have our gifts , -- especially of speech and logic . An
eloquent Vergniaud we have ; most mellifluous yet most impetuous of
public speakers ; from the region named Gironde , of the Garonne : a
man unfortunately of indolent habits ; who will sit playing with your
children , when he ought to be scheming and perorating . Sharp bustling
Guadet ; considerate grave Censonne ; kind @-@ sparkling mirthful young Ducos ;
Valaze doomed to a sad end : all these likewise are of that Gironde ,
or Bourdeaux region : men of fervid Constitutional principles ; of quick
talent , irrefragable logic , clear respectability ; who will have the
Reign of Liberty establish itself , but only by respectable methods .
Round whom others of like temper will gather ; known by and by as
Girondins , to the sorrowing wonder of the world . Of which sort note
Condorcet , Marquis and Philosopher ; who has worked at much , at Paris
Municipal Constitution , Differential Calculus , Newspaper Chronique de
Paris , Biography , Philosophy ; and now sits here as two @-@ years Senator :
a notable Condorcet , with stoical Roman face , and fiery heart ; &apos; volcano
hid under snow ; &apos; styled likewise , in irreverent language , &apos; mouton
enrage , &apos; peaceablest of creatures bitten rabid ! Or note , lastly ,
Jean @-@ Pierre Brissot ; whom Destiny , long working noisily with him , has
hurled hither , say , to have done with him . A biennial Senator he too ;
nay , for the present , the king of such . Restless , scheming , scribbling
Brissot ; who took to himself the style de Warville , heralds know not
in the least why ; -- unless it were that the father of him did , in an
unexceptionable manner , perform Cookery and Vintnery in the Village of
Ouarville ? A man of the windmill species , that grinds always , turning
towards all winds ; not in the steadiest manner .

In all these men there is talent , faculty to work ; and they will do it :
working and shaping , not without effect , though alas not in marble , only
in quicksand ! -- But the highest faculty of them all remains yet to be
mentioned ; or indeed has yet to unfold itself for mention : Captain
Hippolyte Carnot , sent hither from the Pas de Calais ; with his cold
mathematical head , and silent stubbornness of will : iron Carnot ,
far @-@ planning , imperturbable , unconquerable ; who , in the hour of need ,
shall not be found wanting . His hair is yet black ; and it shall grow
grey , under many kinds of fortune , bright and troublous ; and with iron
aspect this man shall face them all .

Nor is Cote Droit , and band of King &apos;s friends , wanting : Vaublanc , Dumas ,
Jaucourt the honoured Chevalier ; who love Liberty , yet with Monarchy
over it ; and speak fearlessly according to that faith ; -- whom the
thick @-@ coming hurricanes will sweep away . With them , let a new military
Theodore Lameth be named ; -- were it only for his two Brothers &apos; sake , who
look down on him , approvingly there , from the Old @-@ Constituents &apos; Gallery .
Frothy professing Pastorets , honey @-@ mouthed conciliatory Lamourettes ,
and speechless nameless individuals sit plentiful , as Moderates , in the
middle . Still less is a Cote Gauche wanting : extreme Left ; sitting on
the topmost benches , as if aloft on its speculatory Height or Mountain ,
which will become a practical fulminatory Height , and make the name of
Mountain famous @-@ infamous to all times and lands .

Honour waits not on this Mountain ; nor as yet even loud dishonour . Gifts
it boasts not , nor graces , of speaking or of thinking ; solely this one
gift of assured faith , of audacity that will defy the Earth and
the Heavens . Foremost here are the Cordelier Trio : hot Merlin from
Thionville , hot Bazire , Attorneys both ; Chabot , disfrocked Capuchin ,
skilful in agio . Lawyer Lacroix , who wore once as subaltern the single
epaulette , has loud lungs and a hungry heart . There too is Couthon ,
little dreaming what he is ; -- whom a sad chance has paralysed in the
lower extremities . For , it seems , he sat once a whole night , not warm in
his true love &apos;s bower ( who indeed was by law another &apos;s ) , but sunken to
the middle in a cold peat @-@ bog , being hunted out ; quaking for his life ,
in the cold quaking morass ; ( Dumouriez , ii . 370 . ) and goes now on
crutches to the end . Cambon likewise , in whom slumbers undeveloped such
a finance @-@ talent for printing of Assignats ; Father of Paper @-@ money ; who ,
in the hour of menace , shall utter this stern sentence , &apos; War to the
Manorhouse , peace to the Hut , Guerre aux Chateaux , paix aux Chaumieres ! &apos;
( Choix de Rapports , xi . 25 . ) Lecointre , the intrepid Draper of
Versailles , is welcome here ; known since the Opera @-@ Repast and
Insurrection of Women . Thuriot too ; Elector Thuriot , who stood in the
embrasures of the Bastille , and saw Saint @-@ Antoine rising in mass ; who
has many other things to see . Last and grimmest of all note old Ruhl ,
with his brown dusky face and long white hair ; of Alsatian Lutheran
breed ; a man whom age and book @-@ learning have not taught ; who , haranguing
the old men of Rheims , shall hold up the Sacred Ampulla ( Heaven @-@ sent ,
wherefrom Clovis and all Kings have been anointed ) as a mere worthless
oil @-@ bottle , and dash it to sherds on the pavement there ; who ,
alas , shall dash much to sherds , and finally his own wild head , by
pistol @-@ shot , and so end it .

Such lava welters redhot in the bowels of this Mountain ; unknown to the
world and to itself ! A mere commonplace Mountain hitherto ; distinguished
from the Plain chiefly by its superior barrenness , its baldness of look :
at the utmost it may , to the most observant , perceptibly smoke . For as
yet all lies so solid , peaceable ; and doubts not , as was said , that
it will endure while Time runs . Do not all love Liberty and the
Constitution ? All heartily ; -- and yet with degrees . Some , as Chevalier
Jaucourt and his Right Side , may love Liberty less than Royalty , were
the trial made ; others , as Brissot and his Left Side , may love it more
than Royalty . Nay again of these latter some may love Liberty more than
Law itself ; others not more . Parties will unfold themselves ; no mortal
as yet knows how . Forces work within these men and without : dissidence
grows opposition ; ever widening ; waxing into incompatibility and
internecine feud : till the strong is abolished by a stronger ; himself in
his turn by a strongest ! Who can help it ? Jaucourt and his Monarchists ,
Feuillans , or Moderates ; Brissot and his Brissotins , Jacobins , or
Girondins ; these , with the Cordelier Trio , and all men , must work what
is appointed them , and in the way appointed them .

And to think what fate these poor Seven Hundred and Forty @-@ five are
assembled , most unwittingly , to meet ! Let no heart be so hard as not to
pity them . Their soul &apos;s wish was to live and work as the First of the
French Parliaments : and make the Constitution march . Did they not , at
their very instalment , go through the most affecting Constitutional
ceremony , almost with tears ? The Twelve Eldest are sent solemnly to
fetch the Constitution itself , the printed book of the Law . Archivist
Camus , an Old @-@ Constituent appointed Archivist , he and the Ancient
Twelve , amid blare of military pomp and clangour , enter , bearing the
divine Book : and President and all Legislative Senators , laying
their hand on the same , successively take the Oath , with cheers and
heart @-@ effusion , universal three @-@ times @-@ three . ( Moniteur , Seance du 4
Octobre 1791 . ) In this manner they begin their Session . Unhappy mortals !
For , that same day , his Majesty having received their Deputation
of welcome , as seemed , rather drily , the Deputation cannot but feel
slighted , cannot but lament such slight : and thereupon our cheering
swearing First Parliament sees itself , on the morrow , obliged to explode
into fierce retaliatory sputter , of anti @-@ royal Enactment as to how
they , for their part , will receive Majesty ; and how Majesty shall not
be called Sire any more , except they please : and then , on the following
day , to recal this Enactment of theirs , as too hasty , and a mere sputter
though not unprovoked .

An effervescent well @-@ intentioned set of Senators ; too combustible , where
continual sparks are flying ! Their History is a series of sputters and
quarrels ; true desire to do their function , fatal impossibility to
do it . Denunciations , reprimandings of King &apos;s Ministers , of traitors
supposed and real ; hot rage and fulmination against fulminating
Emigrants ; terror of Austrian Kaiser , of &apos; Austrian Committee &apos; in the
Tuileries itself : rage and haunting terror , haste and dim desperate
bewilderment ! -- Haste , we say ; and yet the Constitution had provided
against haste . No Bill can be passed till it have been printed , till
it have been thrice read , with intervals of eight days ; -- &apos; unless
the Assembly shall beforehand decree that there is urgency . &apos; Which ,
accordingly , the Assembly , scrupulous of the Constitution , never omits
to do : Considering this , and also considering that , and then that other ,
the Assembly decrees always &apos; qu &apos;il y a urgence ; &apos; and thereupon &apos; the
Assembly , having decreed that there is urgence , &apos; is free to decree -- what
indispensable distracted thing seems best to it . Two thousand and odd
decrees , as men reckon , within Eleven months ! ( Montgaillard , iii .
1 . 237 . ) The haste of the Constituent seemed great ; but this is
treble @-@ quick . For the time itself is rushing treble @-@ quick ; and they
have to keep pace with that . Unhappy Seven Hundred and Forty @-@ five :
true @-@ patriotic , but so combustible ; being fired , they must needs fling
fire : Senate of touchwood and rockets , in a world of smoke @-@ storm , with
sparks wind @-@ driven continually flying !

Or think , on the other hand , looking forward some months , of that scene
they call Baiser de Lamourette ! The dangers of the country are now grown
imminent , immeasurable ; National Assembly , hope of France , is divided
against itself . In such extreme circumstances , honey @-@ mouthed Abbe
Lamourette , new Bishop of Lyons , rises , whose name , l &apos;amourette ,
signifies the sweetheart , or Delilah doxy , -- he rises , and , with pathetic
honied eloquence , calls on all august Senators to forget mutual griefs
and grudges , to swear a new oath , and unite as brothers . Whereupon they
all , with vivats , embrace and swear ; Left Side confounding itself with
Right ; barren Mountain rushing down to fruitful Plain , Pastoret into the
arms of Condorcet , injured to the breast of injurer , with tears ; and all
swearing that whosoever wishes either Feuillant Two @-@ Chamber Monarchy
or Extreme @-@ Jacobin Republic , or any thing but the Constitution and that
only , shall be anathema marantha . ( Moniteur , Seance du 6 Juillet 1792 . )
Touching to behold ! For , literally on the morrow morning , they must
again quarrel , driven by Fate ; and their sublime reconcilement is called
derisively Baiser de L &apos;amourette , or Delilah Kiss .

Like fated Eteocles @-@ Polynices Brothers , embracing , though in vain ;
weeping that they must not love , that they must hate only , and die by
each other &apos;s hands ! Or say , like doomed Familiar Spirits ; ordered , by
Art Magic under penalties , to do a harder than twist ropes of sand : &apos; to
make the Constitution march . &apos; If the Constitution would but march ! Alas ,
the Constitution will not stir . It falls on its face ; they tremblingly
lift it on end again : march , thou gold Constitution ! The Constitution
will not march . -- &quot; He shall march , by -- ! &quot; said kind Uncle Toby , and even
swore . The Corporal answered mournfully : &quot; He will never march in this
world . &quot;

A constitution , as we often say , will march when it images , if not the
old Habits and Beliefs of the Constituted ; then accurately their Rights ,
or better indeed , their Mights ; -- for these two , well @-@ understood , are
they not one and the same ? The old Habits of France are gone : her new
Rights and Mights are not yet ascertained , except in Paper @-@ theorem ;
nor can be , in any sort , till she have tried . Till she have measured
herself , in fell death @-@ grip , and were it in utmost preternatural spasm
of madness , with Principalities and Powers , with the upper and the
under , internal and external ; with the Earth and Tophet and the very
Heaven ! Then will she know . -- Three things bode ill for the marching of
this French Constitution : the French People ; the French King ; thirdly
the French Noblesse and an assembled European World .



Chapter 2.5.III.

Avignon .

But quitting generalities , what strange Fact is this , in the far
South @-@ West , towards which the eyes of all men do now , in the end of
October , bend themselves ? A tragical combustion , long smoking and
smouldering unluminous , has now burst into flame there .

Hot is that Southern Provencal blood : alas , collisions , as was once
said , must occur in a career of Freedom ; different directions will
produce such ; nay different velocities in the same direction will ! To
much that went on there History , busied elsewhere , would not specially
give heed : to troubles of Uzez , troubles of Nismes , Protestant and
Catholic , Patriot and Aristocrat ; to troubles of Marseilles , Montpelier ,
Arles ; to Aristocrat Camp of Jales , that wondrous real @-@ imaginary Entity ,
now fading pale @-@ dim , then always again glowing forth deep @-@ hued ( in the
Imagination mainly ) ; -- ominous magical , &apos; an Aristocrat picture of war
done naturally ! &apos; All this was a tragical deadly combustion , with
plot and riot , tumult by night and by day ; but a dark combustion , not
luminous , not noticed ; which now , however , one cannot help noticing .

Above all places , the unluminous combustion in Avignon and the Comtat
Venaissin was fierce . Papal Avignon , with its Castle rising sheer
over the Rhone @-@ stream ; beautifullest Town , with its purple vines
and gold @-@ orange groves : why must foolish old rhyming Rene , the last
Sovereign of Provence , bequeath it to the Pope and Gold Tiara , not
rather to Louis Eleventh with the Leaden Virgin in his hatband ? For good
and for evil ! Popes , Anti @-@ popes , with their pomp , have dwelt in that
Castle of Avignon rising sheer over the Rhone @-@ stream : there Laura
de Sade went to hear mass ; her Petrarch twanging and singing by the
Fountain of Vaucluse hard by , surely in a most melancholy manner . This
was in the old days .

And now in these new days , such issues do come from a squirt of the pen
by some foolish rhyming Rene , after centuries , this is what we have :
Jourdan Coupe @-@ tete , leading to siege and warfare an Army , from three
to fifteen thousand strong , called the Brigands of Avignon ; which title
they themselves accept , with the addition of an epithet , &apos; The brave
Brigands of Avignon ! &apos; It is even so . Jourdan the Headsman fled hither
from that Chatelet Inquest , from that Insurrection of Women ; and began
dealing in madder ; but the scene was rife in other than dye @-@ stuffs ; so
Jourdan shut his madder shop , and has risen , for he was the man to do
it . The tile @-@ beard of Jourdan is shaven off ; his fat visage has got
coppered and studded with black carbuncles ; the Silenus trunk is
swollen with drink and high living : he wears blue National uniform with
epaulettes , &apos; an enormous sabre , two horse @-@ pistols crossed in his belt ,
and other two smaller , sticking from his pockets ; &apos; styles himself
General , and is the tyrant of men . ( Dampmartin , Evenemens , i . 267 . )
Consider this one fact , O Reader ; and what sort of facts must have
preceded it , must accompany it ! Such things come of old Rene ; and of the
question which has risen , Whether Avignon cannot now cease wholly to be
Papal and become French and free ?

For some twenty @-@ five months the confusion has lasted . Say three months
of arguing ; then seven of raging ; then finally some fifteen months now
of fighting , and even of hanging . For already in February 1790 , the
Papal Aristocrats had set up four gibbets , for a sign ; but the People
rose in June , in retributive frenzy ; and , forcing the public Hangman to
act , hanged four Aristocrats , on each Papal gibbet a Papal Haman . Then
were Avignon Emigrations , Papal Aristocrats emigrating over the Rhone
River ; demission of Papal Consul , flight , victory : re @-@ entrance of
Papal Legate , truce , and new onslaught ; and the various turns of war .
Petitions there were to National Assembly ; Congresses of Townships ;
three @-@ score and odd Townships voting for French Reunion , and the
blessings of Liberty ; while some twelve of the smaller , manipulated by
Aristocrats , gave vote the other way : with shrieks and discord ! Township
against Township , Town against Town : Carpentras , long jealous of
Avignon , is now turned out in open war with it ; -- and Jourdan Coupe @-@ tete ,
your first General being killed in mutiny , closes his dye @-@ shop ; and does
there visibly , with siege @-@ artillery , above all with bluster and tumult ,
with the &apos; brave Brigands of Avignon , &apos; beleaguer the rival Town , for two
months , in the face of the world !

Feats were done , doubt it not , far @-@ famed in Parish History ; but to
Universal History unknown . Gibbets we see rise , on the one side and on
the other ; and wretched carcasses swinging there , a dozen in the row ;
wretched Mayor of Vaison buried before dead . ( Barbaroux , Memoires , p .
26 . ) The fruitful seedfield , lie unreaped , the vineyards trampled down ;
there is red cruelty , madness of universal choler and gall . Havoc and
anarchy everywhere ; a combustion most fierce , but unlucent , not to be
noticed here ! -- Finally , as we saw , on the 14th of September last , the
National Constituent Assembly , having sent Commissioners and heard them ;
( Lescene Desmaisons : Compte rendu a l &apos;Assemblee Nationale , 10 Septembre
1791 ( Choix des Rapports , vii . 273 @-@ 93 ) . ) having heard Petitions , held
Debates , month after month ever since August 1789 ; and on the whole
&apos;spent thirty sittings &apos; on this matter , did solemnly decree that Avignon
and the Comtat were incorporated with France , and His Holiness the Pope
should have what indemnity was reasonable .

And so hereby all is amnestied and finished ? Alas , when madness of
choler has gone through the blood of men , and gibbets have swung on this
side and on that , what will a parchment Decree and Lafayette Amnesty do ?
Oblivious Lethe flows not above ground ! Papal Aristocrats and Patriot
Brigands are still an eye @-@ sorrow to each other ; suspected , suspicious ,
in what they do and forbear . The august Constituent Assembly is gone but
a fortnight , when , on Sunday the Sixteenth morning of October 1791 , the
unquenched combustion suddenly becomes luminous ! For Anti @-@ constitutional
Placards are up , and the Statue of the Virgin is said to have shed
tears , and grown red . ( Proces @-@ verbal de la Commune d &apos;Avignon , &amp; c. in
Hist . Parl. xii . 419 @-@ 23 . ) Wherefore , on that morning , Patriot l &apos;Escuyer ,
one of our &apos; six leading Patriots , &apos; having taken counsel with his
brethren and General Jourdan , determines on going to Church , in company
with a friend or two : not to hear mass , which he values little ; but to
meet all the Papalists there in a body , nay to meet that same weeping
Virgin , for it is the Cordeliers Church ; and give them a word of
admonition . Adventurous errand ; which has the fatallest issue ! What
L &apos;Escuyer &apos;s word of admonition might be no History records ; but the
answer to it was a shrieking howl from the Aristocrat Papal worshippers ,
many of them women . A thousand @-@ voiced shriek and menace ; which as
L &apos;Escuyer did not fly , became a thousand @-@ handed hustle and jostle ; a
thousand @-@ footed kick , with tumblings and tramplings , with the pricking
of semstresses stilettos , scissors , and female pointed instruments .
Horrible to behold ; the ancient Dead , and Petrarchan Laura , sleeping
round it there ; ( Ugo Foscolo , Essay on Petrarch , p . 35 . ) high Altar and
burning tapers looking down on it ; the Virgin quite tearless , and of the
natural stone @-@ colour ! -- L &apos;Escuyer &apos;s friend or two rush off , like Job &apos;s
Messengers , for Jourdan and the National Force . But heavy Jourdan will
seize the Town @-@ Gates first ; does not run treble @-@ fast , as he might :
on arriving at the Cordeliers Church , the Church is silent , vacant ;
L &apos;Escuyer , all alone , lies there , swimming in his blood , at the foot of
the high Altar ; pricked with scissors ; trodden , massacred ; -- gives one
dumb sob , and gasps out his miserable life for evermore .

Sight to stir the heart of any man ; much more of many men , self @-@ styled
Brigands of Avignon ! The corpse of L &apos;Escuyer , stretched on a bier ,
the ghastly head girt with laurel , is borne through the streets ; with
many @-@ voiced unmelodious Nenia ; funeral @-@ wail still deeper than it is
loud ! The copper @-@ face of Jourdan , of bereft Patriotism , has grown black .
Patriot Municipality despatches official Narrative and tidings to Paris ;
orders numerous or innumerable arrestments for inquest and perquisition .
Aristocrats male and female are haled to the Castle ; lie crowded in
subterranean dungeons there , bemoaned by the hoarse rushing of the
Rhone ; cut out from help .

So lie they ; waiting inquest and perquisition . Alas ! with a Jourdan
Headsman for Generalissimo , with his copper @-@ face grown black , and armed
Brigand Patriots chanting their Nenia , the inquest is likely to be
brief . On the next day and the next , let Municipality consent or not , a
Brigand Court @-@ Martial establishes itself in the subterranean stories of
the Castle of Avignon ; Brigand Executioners , with naked sabre , waiting
at the door , for a Brigand verdict . Short judgment , no appeal ! There is
Brigand wrath and vengeance ; not unrefreshed by brandy . Close by is the
Dungeon of the Glaciere , or Ice @-@ Tower : there may be deeds done -- ? For
which language has no name ! -- Darkness and the shadow of horrid cruelty
envelopes these Castle Dungeons , that Glaciere Tower : clear only that
many have entered , that few have returned . Jourdan and the Brigands ,
supreme now over Municipals , over all Authorities Patriot or Papal ,
reign in Avignon , waited on by Terror and Silence .

The result of all which is that , on the 15th of November 1791 , we behold
Friend Dampmartin , and subalterns beneath him , and General Choisi above
him , with Infantry and Cavalry , and proper cannon @-@ carriages rattling in
front , with spread banners , to the sound of fife and drum , wend , in a
deliberate formidable manner , towards that sheer Castle Rock , towards
those broad Gates of Avignon ; three new National @-@ Assembly Commissioners
following at safe distance in the rear . ( Dampmartin , i . 251 @-@ 94 . )
Avignon , summoned in the name of Assembly and Law , flings its Gates wide
open ; Choisi with the rest , Dampmartin and the Bons Enfans , &apos; Good Boys
of Baufremont , &apos; so they name these brave Constitutional Dragoons , known
to them of old , -- do enter , amid shouts and scattered flowers . To the joy
of all honest persons ; to the terror only of Jourdan Headsman and the
Brigands . Nay next we behold carbuncled swollen Jourdan himself shew
copper @-@ face , with sabre and four pistols ; affecting to talk high :
engaging , meanwhile , to surrender the Castle that instant . So the Choisi
Grenadiers enter with him there . They start and stop , passing that
Glaciere , snuffing its horrible breath ; with wild yell , with cries of
&quot; Cut the Butcher down ! &quot; -- and Jourdan has to whisk himself through secret
passages , and instantaneously vanish .

Be the mystery of iniquity laid bare then ! A Hundred and Thirty Corpses ,
of men , nay of women and even children ( for the trembling mother ,
hastily seized , could not leave her infant ) , lie heaped in that
Glaciere ; putrid , under putridities : the horror of the world . For three
days there is mournful lifting out , and recognition ; amid the cries and
movements of a passionate Southern people , now kneeling in prayer , now
storming in wild pity and rage : lastly there is solemn sepulture , with
muffled drums , religious requiem , and all the people &apos;s wail and tears .
Their Massacred rest now in holy ground ; buried in one grave .

And Jourdan Coupe @-@ tete ? Him also we behold again , after a day or two :
in flight , through the most romantic Petrarchan hill @-@ country ; vehemently
spurring his nag ; young Ligonnet , a brisk youth of Avignon , with Choisi
Dragoons , close in his rear ! With such swollen mass of a rider no nag
can run to advantage . The tired nag , spur @-@ driven , does take the River
Sorgue ; but sticks in the middle of it ; firm on that chiaro fondo di
Sorga ; and will proceed no further for spurring ! Young Ligonnet dashes
up ; the Copper @-@ face menaces and bellows , draws pistol , perhaps even
snaps it ; is nevertheless seized by the collar ; is tied firm , ancles
under horse &apos;s belly , and ridden back to Avignon , hardly to be saved from
massacre on the streets there . ( Dampmartin , ubi supra . )

Such is the combustion of Avignon and the South @-@ West , when it becomes
luminous ! Long loud debate is in the august Legislative , in the
Mother @-@ Society as to what now shall be done with it . Amnesty , cry
eloquent Vergniaud and all Patriots : let there be mutual pardon and
repentance , restoration , pacification , and if so might any how be , an
end ! Which vote ultimately prevails . So the South @-@ West smoulders and
welters again in an &apos; Amnesty , &apos; or Non @-@ remembrance , which alas cannot
but remember , no Lethe flowing above ground ! Jourdan himself remains
unchanged ; gets loose again as one not yet gallows @-@ ripe ; nay , as we
transciently discern from the distance , is &apos; carried in triumph through
the cities of the South . &apos; ( Deux Amis vii . ( Paris , 1797 ) , pp. 59 @-@ 71 . )
What things men carry !

With which transient glimpse , of a Copper @-@ faced Portent faring in this
manner through the cities of the South , we must quit these regions ; -- and
let them smoulder . They want not their Aristocrats ; proud old Nobles ,
not yet emigrated . Arles has its &apos; Chiffonne , &apos; so , in symbolical cant ,
they name that Aristocrat Secret @-@ Association ; Arles has its pavements
piled up , by and by , into Aristocrat barricades . Against which Rebecqui ,
the hot @-@ clear Patriot , must lead Marseilles with cannon . The Bar of
Iron has not yet risen to the top in the Bay of Marseilles ; neither
have these hot Sons of the Phoceans submitted to be slaves . By clear
management and hot instance , Rebecqui dissipates that Chiffonne , without
bloodshed ; restores the pavement of Arles . He sails in Coast @-@ barks , this
Rebecqui , scrutinising suspicious Martello @-@ towers , with the keen eye of
Patriotism ; marches overland with despatch , singly , or in force ; to City
after City ; dim scouring far and wide ; ( Barbaroux , p . 21 ; Hist . Parl .
xiii . 421 @-@ 4 . ) -- argues , and if it must be , fights . For there is much
to do ; Jales itself is looking suspicious . So that Legislator Fauchet ,
after debate on it , has to propose Commissioners and a Camp on the Plain
of Beaucaire : with or without result .

Of all which , and much else , let us note only this small consequence ,
that young Barbaroux , Advocate , Town @-@ Clerk of Marseilles , being charged
to have these things remedied , arrived at Paris in the month of February
1792 . The beautiful and brave : young Spartan , ripe in energy , not ripe
in wisdom ; over whose black doom there shall flit nevertheless a certain
ruddy fervour , streaks of bright Southern tint , not wholly swallowed of
Death ! Note also that the Rolands of Lyons are again in Paris ; for the
second and final time . King &apos;s Inspectorship is abrogated at Lyons , as
elsewhere : Roland has his retiring @-@ pension to claim , if attainable ; has
Patriot friends to commune with ; at lowest , has a book to publish . That
young Barbaroux and the Rolands came together ; that elderly Spartan
Roland liked , or even loved the young Spartan , and was loved by him , one
can fancy : and Madame -- ? Breathe not , thou poison @-@ breath , Evil @-@ speech !
That soul is taintless , clear , as the mirror @-@ sea . And yet if they too
did look into each other &apos;s eyes , and each , in silence , in tragical
renunciance , did find that the other was all too lovely ? Honi soit !
She calls him &apos; beautiful as Antinous : &apos; he &apos; will speak elsewhere of that
astonishing woman . &apos; -- A Madame d &apos;Udon ( or some such name , for Dumont does
not recollect quite clearly ) gives copious Breakfast to the Brissotin
Deputies and us Friends of Freedom , at her house in the Place Vendome ;
with temporary celebrity , with graces and wreathed smiles ; not without
cost . There , amid wide babble and jingle , our plan of Legislative Debate
is settled for the day , and much counselling held . Strict Roland is seen
there , but does not go often . ( Dumont , Souvenirs , p . 374 . )



Chapter 2.5.IV.

No Sugar .

Such are our inward troubles ; seen in the Cities of the South ; extant ,
seen or unseen , in all cities and districts , North as well as South . For
in all are Aristocrats , more or less malignant ; watched by Patriotism ;
which again , being of various shades , from light Fayettist @-@ Feuillant
down to deep @-@ sombre Jacobin , has to watch itself !

Directories of Departments , what we call County Magistracies , being
chosen by Citizens of a too &apos; active &apos; class , are found to pull one way ;
Municipalities , Town Magistracies , to pull the other way . In all places
too are Dissident Priests ; whom the Legislative will have to deal
with : contumacious individuals , working on that angriest of passions ;
plotting , enlisting for Coblentz ; or suspected of plotting : fuel of
a universal unconstitutional heat . What to do with them ? They may be
conscientious as well as contumacious : gently they should be dealt with ,
and yet it must be speedily . In unilluminated La Vendee the simple are
like to be seduced by them ; many a simple peasant , a Cathelineau the
wool @-@ dealer wayfaring meditative with his wool @-@ packs , in these hamlets ,
dubiously shakes his head ! Two Assembly Commissioners went thither last
Autumn ; considerate Gensonne , not yet called to be a Senator ; Gallois ,
an editorial man . These Two , consulting with General Dumouriez , spake
and worked , softly , with judgment ; they have hushed down the irritation ,
and produced a soft Report , -- for the time .

The General himself doubts not in the least but he can keep peace there ;
being an able man . He passes these frosty months among the pleasant
people of Niort , occupies &apos; tolerably handsome apartments in the Castle
of Niort , &apos; and tempers the minds of men . ( Dumouriez , ii . 129 . ) Why is
there but one Dumouriez ? Elsewhere you find South or North , nothing but
untempered obscure jarring ; which breaks forth ever and anon into open
clangour of riot . Southern Perpignan has its tocsin , by torch light ;
with rushing and onslaught : Northern Caen not less , by daylight ; with
Aristocrats ranged in arms at Places of Worship ; Departmental compromise
proving impossible ; breaking into musketry and a Plot discovered ! ( Hist .
Parl. xii . 131 , 141 ; xiii . 114 , 417 . ) Add Hunger too : for Bread , always
dear , is getting dearer : not so much as Sugar can be had ; for good
reasons . Poor Simoneau , Mayor of Etampes , in this Northern region ,
hanging out his Red Flag in some riot of grains , is trampled to death by
a hungry exasperated People . What a trade this of Mayor , in these times !
Mayor of Saint @-@ Denis hung at the Lanterne , by Suspicion and Dyspepsia ,
as we saw long since ; Mayor of Vaison , as we saw lately , buried before
dead ; and now this poor Simoneau , the Tanner , of Etampes , -- whom legal
Constitutionalism will not forget .

With factions , suspicions , want of bread and sugar , it is verily what
they call dechire , torn asunder this poor country : France and all that
is French . For , over seas too come bad news . In black Saint @-@ Domingo ,
before that variegated Glitter in the Champs Elysees was lit for an
Accepted Constitution , there had risen , and was burning contemporary
with it , quite another variegated Glitter and nocturnal Fulgor , had
we known it : of molasses and ardent @-@ spirits ; of sugar @-@ boileries ,
plantations , furniture , cattle and men : skyhigh ; the Plain of Cap
Francais one huge whirl of smoke and flame !

What a change here , in these two years ; since that first &apos; Box of
Tricolor Cockades &apos; got through the Custom @-@ house , and atrabiliar Creoles
too rejoiced that there was a levelling of Bastilles ! Levelling is
comfortable , as we often say : levelling , yet only down to oneself . Your
pale @-@ white Creoles , have their grievances : -- and your yellow Quarteroons ?
And your dark @-@ yellow Mulattoes ? And your Slaves soot @-@ black ? Quarteroon
Oge , Friend of our Parisian Brissotin Friends of the Blacks , felt , for
his share too , that Insurrection was the most sacred of duties . So the
tricolor Cockades had fluttered and swashed only some three months on
the Creole hat , when Oge &apos;s signal @-@ conflagrations went aloft ; with the
voice of rage and terror . Repressed , doomed to die , he took black powder
or seedgrains in the hollow of his hand , this Oge ; sprinkled a film
of white ones on the top , and said to his Judges , &quot; Behold they are
white ; &quot; -- then shook his hand , and said &quot; Where are the Whites , Ou sont
les Blancs ? &quot;

So now , in the Autumn of 1791 , looking from the sky @-@ windows of Cap
Francais , thick clouds of smoke girdle our horizon , smoke in the day ,
in the night fire ; preceded by fugitive shrieking white women , by Terror
and Rumour . Black demonised squadrons are massacring and harrying ,
with nameless cruelty . They fight and fire &apos; from behind thickets and
coverts , &apos; for the Black man loves the Bush ; they rush to the attack ,
thousands strong , with brandished cutlasses and fusils , with caperings ,
shoutings and vociferation , -- which , if the White Volunteer Company
stands firm , dwindle into staggerings , into quick gabblement , into panic
flight at the first volley , perhaps before it . ( Deux Amis , x . 157 . ) Poor
Oge could be broken on the wheel ; this fire @-@ whirlwind too can be abated ,
driven up into the Mountains : but Saint @-@ Domingo is shaken , as Oge &apos;s
seedgrains were ; shaking , writhing in long horrid death @-@ throes , it is
Black without remedy ; and remains , as African Haiti , a monition to the
world .

O my Parisian Friends , is not this , as well as Regraters and Feuillant
Plotters , one cause of the astonishing dearth of Sugar ! The Grocer ,
palpitant , with drooping lip , sees his Sugar taxe ; weighed out by Female
Patriotism , in instant retail , at the inadequate rate of twenty @-@ five
sous , or thirteen pence a pound . &quot; Abstain from it ? &quot; yes , ye Patriot
Sections , all ye Jacobins , abstain ! Louvet and Collot @-@ d &apos;Herbois so
advise ; resolute to make the sacrifice : though &quot; how shall literary men
do without coffee ? &quot; Abstain , with an oath ; that is the surest ! ( Debats
des Jacobins , &amp; c . Hist . Parl. xiii . 171 , 92 @-@ 98 . )

Also , for like reason , must not Brest and the Shipping Interest
languish ? Poor Brest languishes , sorrowing , not without spleen ;
denounces an Aristocrat Bertrand @-@ Moleville traitorous Aristocrat
Marine @-@ Minister . Do not her Ships and King &apos;s Ships lie rotting piecemeal
in harbour ; Naval Officers mostly fled , and on furlough too , with pay ?
Little stirring there ; if it be not the Brest Gallies , whip @-@ driven ,
with their Galley @-@ Slaves , -- alas , with some Forty of our hapless Swiss
Soldiers of Chateau @-@ Vieux , among others ! These Forty Swiss , too mindful
of Nanci , do now , in their red wool caps , tug sorrowfully at the oar ;
looking into the Atlantic brine , which reflects only their own sorrowful
shaggy faces ; and seem forgotten of Hope .

But , on the whole , may we not say , in fugitive language , that the French
Constitution which shall march is very rheumatic , full of shooting
internal pains , in joint and muscle ; and will not march without
difficulty ?



Chapter 2.5.V.

Kings and Emigrants .

Extremely rheumatic Constitutions have been known to march , and keep on
their feet , though in a staggering sprawling manner , for long periods ,
in virtue of one thing only : that the Head were healthy . But this Head
of the French Constitution ! What King Louis is and cannot help being ,
Readers already know . A King who cannot take the Constitution , nor
reject the Constitution : nor do anything at all , but miserably ask , What
shall I do ? A King environed with endless confusions ; in whose own mind
is no germ of order . Haughty implacable remnants of Noblesse struggling
with humiliated repentant Barnave @-@ Lameths : struggling in that obscure
element of fetchers and carriers , of Half @-@ pay braggarts from the Cafe
Valois , of Chambermaids , whisperers , and subaltern officious persons ;
fierce Patriotism looking on all the while , more and more suspicious ,
from without : what , in such struggle , can they do ? At best , cancel
one another , and produce zero . Poor King ! Barnave and your Senatorial
Jaucourts speak earnestly into this ear ; Bertrand @-@ Moleville , and
Messengers from Coblentz , speak earnestly into that : the poor Royal head
turns to the one side and to the other side ; can turn itself fixedly
to no side . Let Decency drop a veil over it : sorrier misery was seldom
enacted in the world . This one small fact , does it not throw the saddest
light on much ? The Queen is lamenting to Madam Campan : &quot; What am I to do ?
When they , these Barnaves , get us advised to any step which the Noblesse
do not like , then I am pouted at ; nobody comes to my card table ; the
King &apos;s Couchee is solitary . &quot; ( Campan , ii . 177 @-@ 202 . ) In such a case of
dubiety , what is one to do ? Go inevitably to the ground !

The King has accepted this Constitution , knowing beforehand that it will
not serve : he studies it , and executes it in the hope mainly that it
will be found inexecutable . King &apos;s Ships lie rotting in harbour , their
officers gone ; the Armies disorganised ; robbers scour the highways ,
which wear down unrepaired ; all Public Service lies slack and waste : the
Executive makes no effort , or an effort only to throw the blame on the
Constitution . Shamming death , &apos; faisant le mort ! &apos; What Constitution ,
use it in this manner , can march ? &apos; Grow to disgust the Nation &apos; it will
truly , ( Bertrand @-@ Moleville , i. c . 4 . ) -- unless you first grow to disgust
the Nation ! It is Bertrand de Moleville &apos;s plan , and his Majesty &apos;s ; the
best they can form .

Or if , after all , this best @-@ plan proved too slow ; proved a failure ?
Provident of that too , the Queen , shrouded in deepest mystery , &apos; writes
all day , in cipher , day after day , to Coblentz ; &apos; Engineer Goguelat , he
of the Night of Spurs , whom the Lafayette Amnesty has delivered from
Prison , rides and runs . Now and then , on fit occasion , a Royal familiar
visit can be paid to that Salle de Manege , an affecting encouraging
Royal Speech ( sincere , doubt it not , for the moment ) can be delivered
there , and the Senators all cheer and almost weep ; -- at the same time
Mallet du Pan has visibly ceased editing , and invisibly bears abroad
a King &apos;s Autograph , soliciting help from the Foreign Potentates .
( Moleville , i . 370 . ) Unhappy Louis , do this thing or else that
other , -- if thou couldst !

The thing which the King &apos;s Government did do was to stagger distractedly
from contradiction to contradiction ; and wedding Fire to Water , envelope
itself in hissing , and ashy steam ! Danton and needy corruptible Patriots
are sopped with presents of cash : they accept the sop : they rise
refreshed by it , and travel their own way . ( Ibid. i. c . 17 . ) Nay , the
King &apos;s Government did likewise hire Hand @-@ clappers , or claqueurs , persons
to applaud . Subterranean Rivarol has Fifteen Hundred men in King &apos;s pay ,
at the rate of some ten thousand pounds sterling , per month ; what he
calls &apos; a staff of genius : &apos; Paragraph @-@ writers , Placard @-@ Journalists ; &apos; two
hundred and eighty Applauders , at three shillings a day : &apos; one of
the strangest Staffs ever commanded by man . The muster @-@ rolls
and account @-@ books of which still exist . ( Montgaillard , iii . 41 . )
Bertrand @-@ Moleville himself , in a way he thinks very dexterous , contrives
to pack the Galleries of the Legislative ; gets Sansculottes hired to go
thither , and applaud at a signal given , they fancying it was Petion that
bid them : a device which was not detected for almost a week . Dexterous
enough ; as if a man finding the Day fast decline should determine on
altering the Clockhands : that is a thing possible for him .

Here too let us note an unexpected apparition of Philippe d &apos;Orleans at
Court : his last at the Levee of any King . D &apos;Orleans , sometime in the
winter months seemingly , has been appointed to that old first @-@ coveted
rank of Admiral , -- though only over ships rotting in port . The wished @-@ for
comes too late ! However , he waits on Bertrand @-@ Moleville to give thanks :
nay to state that he would willingly thank his Majesty in person ; that ,
in spite of all the horrible things men have said and sung , he is far
from being his Majesty &apos;s enemy ; at bottom , how far ! Bertrand delivers
the message , brings about the royal Interview , which does pass to
the satisfaction of his Majesty ; d &apos;Orleans seeming clearly repentant ,
determined to turn over a new leaf . And yet , next Sunday , what do we
see ? &apos; Next Sunday , &apos; says Bertrand , &apos; he came to the King &apos;s Levee ; but the
Courtiers ignorant of what had passed , the crowd of Royalists who were
accustomed to resort thither on that day specially to pay their court ,
gave him the most humiliating reception . They came pressing round him ;
managing , as if by mistake , to tread on his toes , to elbow him towards
the door , and not let him enter again . He went downstairs to her
Majesty &apos;s Apartments , where cover was laid ; so soon as he shewed face ,
sounds rose on all sides , &quot; Messieurs , take care of the dishes , &quot; as if he
had carried poison in his pockets . The insults which his presence every
where excited forced him to retire without having seen the Royal Family :
the crowd followed him to the Queen &apos;s Staircase ; in descending , he
received a spitting ( crachat ) on the head , and some others , on his
clothes . Rage and spite were seen visibly painted on his face : &apos;
( Bertrand @-@ Moleville , i . 177 . ) as indeed how could they miss to be ? He
imputes it all to the King and Queen , who know nothing of it , who are
even much grieved at it ; and so descends , to his Chaos again . Bertrand
was there at the Chateau that day himself , and an eye @-@ witness to these
things .

For the rest , Non @-@ jurant Priests , and the repression of them , will
distract the King &apos;s conscience ; Emigrant Princes and Noblesse will force
him to double @-@ dealing : there must be veto on veto ; amid the ever @-@ waxing
indignation of men . For Patriotism , as we said , looks on from without ,
more and more suspicious . Waxing tempest , blast after blast , of Patriot
indignation , from without ; dim inorganic whirl of Intrigues , Fatuities ,
within ! Inorganic , fatuous ; from which the eye turns away . De Stael
intrigues for her so gallant Narbonne , to get him made War @-@ Minister ;
and ceases not , having got him made . The King shall fly to Rouen ; shall
there , with the gallant Narbonne , properly &apos; modify the Constitution . &apos; 
This is the same brisk Narbonne , who , last year , cut out from their
entanglement , by force of dragoons , those poor fugitive Royal Aunts :
men say he is at bottom their Brother , or even more , so scandalous is
scandal . He drives now , with his de Stael , rapidly to the Armies , to
the Frontier Towns ; produces rose @-@ coloured Reports , not too credible ;
perorates , gesticulates ; wavers poising himself on the top , for a
moment , seen of men ; then tumbles , dismissed , washed away by the
Time @-@ flood .

Also the fair Princess de Lamballe intrigues , bosom friend of her
Majesty : to the angering of Patriotism . Beautiful Unfortunate , why did
she ever return from England ? Her small silver @-@ voice , what can it profit
in that piping of the black World @-@ tornado ? Which will whirl her , poor
fragile Bird of Paradise , against grim rocks . Lamballe and de Stael
intrigue visibly , apart or together : but who shall reckon how many
others , and in what infinite ways , invisibly ! Is there not what one may
call an &apos; Austrian Committee , &apos; sitting invisible in the Tuileries ; centre
of an invisible Anti @-@ National Spiderweb , which , for we sleep among
mysteries , stretches its threads to the ends of the Earth ? Journalist
Carra has now the clearest certainty of it : to Brissotin Patriotism , and
France generally , it is growing more and more probable .

O Reader , hast thou no pity for this Constitution ? Rheumatic shooting
pains in its members ; pressure of hydrocephale and hysteric vapours
on its Brain : a Constitution divided against itself ; which will never
march , hardly even stagger ? Why were not Drouet and Procureur Sausse in
their beds , that unblessed Varennes Night ! Why did they not , in the
name of Heaven , let the Korff Berline go whither it listed ! Nameless
incoherency , incompatibility , perhaps prodigies at which the world still
shudders , had been spared .

But now comes the third thing that bodes ill for the marching of this
French Constitution : besides the French People , and the French King ,
there is thirdly -- the assembled European world ? it has become necessary
now to look at that also . Fair France is so luminous : and round and
round it , is troublous Cimmerian Night . Calonnes , Breteuils hover dim ,
far @-@ flown ; overnetting Europe with intrigues . From Turin to Vienna ;
to Berlin , and utmost Petersburg in the frozen North ! Great Burke has
raised his great voice long ago ; eloquently demonstrating that the end
of an Epoch is come , to all appearance the end of Civilised Time . Him
many answer : Camille Desmoulins , Clootz Speaker of Mankind , Paine the
rebellious Needleman , and honourable Gallic Vindicators in that country
and in this : but the great Burke remains unanswerable ; &apos; The Age of
Chivalry is gone , &apos; and could not but go , having now produced the still
more indomitable Age of Hunger . Altars enough , of the Dubois @-@ Rohan
sort , changing to the Gobel @-@ and @-@ Talleyrand sort , are faring by rapid
transmutation to , shall we say , the right Proprietor of them ? French
Game and French Game @-@ Preservers did alight on the Cliffs of Dover , with
cries of distress . Who will say that the end of much is not come ? A
set of mortals has risen , who believe that Truth is not a printed
Speculation , but a practical Fact ; that Freedom and Brotherhood are
possible in this Earth , supposed always to be Belial &apos;s , which &apos; the
Supreme Quack &apos; was to inherit ! Who will say that Church , State , Throne ,
Altar are not in danger ; that the sacred Strong @-@ box itself , last
Palladium of effete Humanity , may not be blasphemously blown upon , and
its padlocks undone ?

The poor Constituent Assembly might act with what delicacy and diplomacy
it would ; declare that it abjured meddling with its neighbours ,
foreign conquest , and so forth ; but from the first this thing was to be
predicted : that old Europe and new France could not subsist together .
A Glorious Revolution , oversetting State @-@ Prisons and Feudalism ;
publishing , with outburst of Federative Cannon , in face of all the
Earth , that Appearance is not Reality , how shall it subsist amid
Governments which , if Appearance is not Reality , are -- one knows not
what ? In death feud , and internecine wrestle and battle , it shall
subsist with them ; not otherwise .

Rights of Man , printed on Cotton Handkerchiefs , in various dialects of
human speech , pass over to the Frankfort Fair . ( Toulongeon , i . 256 . )
What say we , Frankfort Fair ? They have crossed Euphrates and the
fabulous Hydaspes ; wafted themselves beyond the Ural , Altai , Himmalayah :
struck off from wood stereotypes , in angular Picture @-@ writing , they
are jabbered and jingled of in China and Japan . Where will it stop ?
Kien @-@ Lung smells mischief ; not the remotest Dalai @-@ Lama shall now knead
his dough @-@ pills in peace . -- Hateful to us ; as is the Night ! Bestir
yourselves , ye Defenders of Order ! They do bestir themselves : all Kings
and Kinglets , with their spiritual temporal array , are astir ; their
brows clouded with menace . Diplomatic emissaries fly swift ; Conventions ,
privy Conclaves assemble ; and wise wigs wag , taking what counsel they
can .

Also , as we said , the Pamphleteer draws pen , on this side and that :
zealous fists beat the Pulpit @-@ drum . Not without issue ! Did not iron
Birmingham , shouting &apos; Church and King , &apos; itself knew not why , burst out ,
last July , into rage , drunkenness , and fire ; and your Priestleys , and
the like , dining there on that Bastille day , get the maddest singeing :
scandalous to consider ! In which same days , as we can remark , high
Potentates , Austrian and Prussian , with Emigrants , were faring towards
Pilnitz in Saxony ; there , on the 27th of August , they , keeping to
themselves what further &apos; secret Treaty &apos; there might or might not be , did
publish their hopes and their threatenings , their Declaration that it
was &apos; the common cause of Kings . &apos; 

Where a will to quarrel is , there is a way . Our readers remember that
Pentecost @-@ Night , Fourth of August 1789 , when Feudalism fell in a few
hours ? The National Assembly , in abolishing Feudalism , promised
that &apos; compensation &apos; should be given ; and did endeavour to give it .
Nevertheless the Austrian Kaiser answers that his German Princes , for
their part , cannot be unfeudalised ; that they have Possessions in French
Alsace , and Feudal Rights secured to them , for which no conceivable
compensation will suffice . So this of the Possessioned Princes , &apos; Princes
Possessiones &apos; is bandied from Court to Court ; covers acres of diplomatic
paper at this day : a weariness to the world . Kaunitz argues from Vienna ;
Delessart responds from Paris , though perhaps not sharply enough . The
Kaiser and his Possessioned Princes will too evidently come and take
compensation -- so much as they can get . Nay might one not partition
France , as we have done Poland , and are doing ; and so pacify it with a
vengeance ?

From South to North ! For actually it is &apos; the common cause of Kings . &apos; 
Swedish Gustav , sworn Knight of the Queen of France , will lead Coalised
Armies ; -- had not Ankarstrom treasonously shot him ; for , indeed , there
were griefs nearer home . ( 30th March 1792 Annual Register , p . 11 ) .
Austria and Prussia speak at Pilnitz ; all men intensely listening :
Imperial Rescripts have gone out from Turin ; there will be secret
Convention at Vienna . Catherine of Russia beckons approvingly ; will
help , were she ready . Spanish Bourbon stirs amid his pillows ; from him
too , even from him , shall there come help . Lean Pitt , &apos; the Minister of
Preparatives , &apos; looks out from his watch @-@ tower in Saint @-@ James &apos;s , in a
suspicious manner . Councillors plotting , Calonnes dim @-@ hovering ; -- alas ,
Serjeants rub @-@ a @-@ dubbing openly through all manner of German
market @-@ towns , collecting ragged valour ! ( Toulongeon , ii . 100 @-@ 117 . ) Look
where you will , immeasurable Obscurantism is girdling this fair France ;
which , again , will not be girdled by it . Europe is in travail ; pang
after pang ; what a shriek was that of Pilnitz ! The birth will be : WAR .

Nay the worst feature of the business is this last , still to be named ;
the Emigrants at Coblentz , so many thousands ranking there , in bitter
hate and menace : King &apos;s Brothers , all Princes of the Blood except wicked
d &apos;Orleans ; your duelling de Castries , your eloquent Cazales ; bull @-@ headed
Malseignes , a wargod Broglie ; Distaff Seigneurs , insulted Officers , all
that have ridden across the Rhine @-@ stream ; -- d &apos;Artois welcoming Abbe
Maury with a kiss , and clasping him publicly to his own royal heart !
Emigration , flowing over the Frontiers , now in drops , now in streams , in
various humours of fear , of petulance , rage and hope , ever since those
first Bastille days when d &apos;Artois went , &apos; to shame the citizens of
Paris , &apos; -- has swollen to the size of a Phenomenon of the world . Coblentz
is become a small extra @-@ national Versailles ; a Versailles in partibus :
briguing , intriguing , favouritism , strumpetocracy itself , they say , goes
on there ; all the old activities , on a small scale , quickened by hungry
Revenge .

Enthusiasm , of loyalty , of hatred and hope , has risen to a high pitch ;
as , in any Coblentz tavern , you may hear , in speech , and in singing .
Maury assists in the interior Council ; much is decided on ; for one
thing , they keep lists of the dates of your emigrating ; a month sooner ,
or a month later determines your greater or your less right to
the coming Division of the Spoil . Cazales himself , because he had
occasionally spoken with a Constitutional tone , was looked on coldly at
first : so pure are our principles . ( Montgaillard , iii . 517 ; Toulongeon ,
( ubi supra ) . ) And arms are a @-@ hammering at Liege ; &apos; three thousand
horses &apos; ambling hitherward from the Fairs of Germany : Cavalry enrolling ;
likewise Foot @-@ soldiers , &apos; in blue coat , red waistcoat , and nankeen
trousers ! &apos; ( See Hist . Parl. xiii . 11 @-@ 38 , 41 @-@ 61 , 358 , &amp; c . ) They have
their secret domestic correspondences , as their open foreign : with
disaffected Crypto @-@ Aristocrats , with contumacious Priests , with Austrian
Committee in the Tuileries . Deserters are spirited over by assiduous
crimps ; Royal @-@ Allemand is gone almost wholly . Their route of march ,
towards France and the Division of the Spoil , is marked out , were the
Kaiser once ready . &quot; It is said , they mean to poison the sources ; but , &quot;
adds Patriotism making Report of it , &quot; they will not poison the source of
Liberty , &quot; whereat &apos; on applaudit , &apos; we cannot but applaud . Also they have
manufactories of False Assignats ; and men that circulate in the interior
distributing and disbursing the same ; one of these we denounce now to
Legislative Patriotism : &apos; A man Lebrun by name ; about thirty years of
age , with blonde hair and in quantity ; has , &apos; only for the time being
surely , &apos; a black @-@ eye , oeil poche ; goes in a wiski with a black horse , &apos;
( Moniteur , Seance du 2 Novembre 1791 ( Hist . Parl. xii . 212 ) . ) -- always
keeping his Gig !

Unhappy Emigrants , it was their lot , and the lot of France ! They are
ignorant of much that they should know : of themselves , of what is around
them . A Political Party that knows not when it is beaten , may become one
of the fatallist of things , to itself , and to all . Nothing will convince
these men that they cannot scatter the French Revolution at the first
blast of their war @-@ trumpet ; that the French Revolution is other than a
blustering Effervescence , of brawlers and spouters , which , at the flash
of chivalrous broadswords , at the rustle of gallows @-@ ropes , will burrow
itself , in dens the deeper the welcomer . But , alas , what man does know
and measure himself , and the things that are round him ; -- else where
were the need of physical fighting at all ? Never , till they are cleft
asunder , can these heads believe that a Sansculottic arm has any vigour
in it : cleft asunder , it will be too late to believe .

One may say , without spleen against his poor erring brothers of any
side , that above all other mischiefs , this of the Emigrant Nobles acted
fatally on France . Could they have known , could they have understood ! In
the beginning of 1789 , a splendour and a terror still surrounded them :
the Conflagration of their Chateaus , kindled by months of obstinacy ,
went out after the Fourth of August ; and might have continued out , had
they at all known what to defend , what to relinquish as indefensible .
They were still a graduated Hierarchy of Authorities , or the accredited
Similitude of such : they sat there , uniting King with Commonalty ;
transmitting and translating gradually , from degree to degree , the
command of the one into the obedience of the other ; rendering command
and obedience still possible . Had they understood their place , and what
to do in it , this French Revolution , which went forth explosively in
years and in months , might have spread itself over generations ; and
not a torture @-@ death but a quiet euthanasia have been provided for many
things .

But they were proud and high , these men ; they were not wise to consider .
They spurned all from them ; in disdainful hate , they drew the sword
and flung away the scabbard . France has not only no Hierarchy of
Authorities , to translate command into obedience ; its Hierarchy of
Authorities has fled to the enemies of France ; calls loudly on the
enemies of France to interfere armed , who want but a pretext to do
that . Jealous Kings and Kaisers might have looked on long , meditating
interference , yet afraid and ashamed to interfere : but now do not the
King &apos;s Brothers , and all French Nobles , Dignitaries and Authorities that
are free to speak , which the King himself is not , -- passionately invite
us , in the name of Right and of Might ? Ranked at Coblentz , from Fifteen
to Twenty thousand stand now brandishing their weapons , with the cry :
On , on ! Yes , Messieurs , you shall on ; -- and divide the spoil according to
your dates of emigrating .

Of all which things a poor Legislative Assembly , and Patriot France , is
informed : by denunciant friend , by triumphant foe . Sulleau &apos;s Pamphlets ,
of the Rivarol Staff of Genius , circulate ; heralding supreme hope .
Durosoy &apos;s Placards tapestry the walls ; Chant du Coq crows day , pecked
at by Tallien &apos;s Ami des Citoyens . King &apos;s @-@ Friend , Royou , Ami du Roi ,
can name , in exact arithmetical ciphers , the contingents of the various
Invading Potentates ; in all , Four hundred and nineteen thousand Foreign
fighting men , with Fifteen thousand Emigrants . Not to reckon these your
daily and hourly desertions , which an Editor must daily record , of whole
Companies , and even Regiments , crying Vive le Roi , vive la Reine , and
marching over with banners spread : ( Ami du Roi Newspaper in Hist . Parl .
xiii . 175 . ) -- lies all , and wind ; yet to Patriotism not wind ; nor , alas ,
one day , to Royou ! Patriotism , therefore , may brawl and babble yet a
little while : but its hours are numbered : Europe is coming with Four
hundred and nineteen thousand and the Chivalry of France ; the gallows ,
one may hope , will get its own .



Chapter 2.5.VI.

Brigands and Jales .

We shall have War , then ; and on what terms ! With an Executive
&apos;pretending , &apos; really with less and less deceptiveness now , &apos; to be dead ; &apos;
casting even a wishful eye towards the enemy : on such terms we shall
have War .

Public Functionary in vigorous action there is none ; if it be not
Rivarol with his Staff of Genius and Two hundred and eighty Applauders .
The Public Service lies waste : the very tax @-@ gatherer has forgotten
his cunning : in this and the other Provincial Board of Management
( Directoire de Departmente ) it is found advisable to retain what Taxes
you can gather , to pay your own inevitable expenditures . Our Revenue is
Assignats ; emission on emission of Paper @-@ money . And the Army ; our
Three grand Armies , of Rochambeau , of Luckner , of Lafayette ? Lean ,
disconsolate hover these Three grand Armies , watching the Frontiers
there ; three Flights of long @-@ necked Cranes in moulting time ; -- wretched ,
disobedient , disorganised ; who never saw fire ; the old Generals and
Officers gone across the Rhine . War @-@ minister Narbonne , he of the
rose @-@ coloured Reports , solicits recruitments , equipments , money , always
money ; threatens , since he can get none , -- to &apos; take his sword , &apos; which
belongs to himself , and go serve his country with that . ( Moniteur ,
Seance du 23 Janvier , 1792 ; Biographie des Ministres para Narbonne . )

The question of questions is : What shall be done ? Shall we , with a
desperate defiance which Fortune sometimes favours , draw the sword
at once , in the face of this in @-@ rushing world of Emigration and
Obscurantism ; or wait , and temporise and diplomatise , till , if possible ,
our resources mature themselves a little ? And yet again are our
resources growing towards maturity ; or growing the other way ? Dubious :
the ablest Patriots are divided ; Brissot and his Brissotins , or
Girondins , in the Legislative , cry aloud for the former defiant plan ;
Robespierre , in the Jacobins , pleads as loud for the latter dilatory
one : with responses , even with mutual reprimands ; distracting the Mother
of Patriotism . Consider also what agitated Breakfasts there may be at
Madame d &apos;Udon &apos;s in the Place Vendome ! The alarm of all men is great .
Help , ye Patriots ; and O at least agree ; for the hour presses . Frost was
not yet gone , when in that &apos; tolerably handsome apartment of the Castle
of Niort , &apos; there arrived a Letter : General Dumouriez must to Paris . It
is War @-@ minister Narbonne that writes ; the General shall give counsel
about many things . ( Dumouriez , ii. c . 6 . ) In the month of February 1792,
Brissotin friends welcome their Dumouriez Polymetis , -- comparable
really to an antique Ulysses in modern costume ; quick , elastic , shifty ,
insuppressible , a &apos; many @-@ counselled man . &apos; 

Let the Reader fancy this fair France with a whole Cimmerian Europe
girdling her , rolling in on her ; black , to burst in red thunder of War ;
fair France herself hand @-@ shackled and foot @-@ shackled in the weltering
complexities of this Social Clothing , or Constitution , which they have
made for her ; a France that , in such Constitution , cannot march ! And
Hunger too ; and plotting Aristocrats , and excommunicating Dissident
Priests : &apos; The man Lebrun by name &apos; urging his black wiski , visible to the
eye : and , still more terrible in his invisibility , Engineer Goguelat ,
with Queen &apos;s cipher , riding and running !

The excommunicatory Priests give new trouble in the Maine and Loire ; La
Vendee , nor Cathelineau the wool @-@ dealer , has not ceased grumbling
and rumbling . Nay behold Jales itself once more : how often does that
real @-@ imaginary Camp of the Fiend require to be extinguished ! For
near two years now , it has waned faint and again waxed bright , in the
bewildered soul of Patriotism : actually , if Patriotism knew it , one
of the most surprising products of Nature working with Art . Royalist
Seigneurs , under this or the other pretext , assemble the simple people
of these Cevennes Mountains ; men not unused to revolt , and with heart
for fighting , could their poor heads be got persuaded . The Royalist
Seigneur harangues ; harping mainly on the religious string : &quot; True
Priests maltreated , false Priests intruded , Protestants ( once dragooned )
now triumphing , things sacred given to the dogs ; &quot; and so produces , from
the pious Mountaineer throat , rough growlings . &quot; Shall we not testify ,
then , ye brave hearts of the Cevennes ; march to the rescue ? Holy
Religion ; duty to God and King ? &quot; &quot; Si fait , si fait , Just so , just so , &quot;
answer the brave hearts always : &quot; Mais il y a de bien bonnes choses
dans la Revolution , But there are many good things in the Revolution
too ! &quot; -- And so the matter , cajole as we may , will only turn on its axis ,
not stir from the spot , and remains theatrical merely . ( Dampmartin , i .
201 . )

Nevertheless deepen your cajolery , harp quick and quicker , ye Royalist
Seigneurs ; with a dead @-@ lift effort you may bring it to that . In
the month of June next , this Camp of Jales will step forth as a
theatricality suddenly become real ; Two thousand strong , and with the
boast that it is Seventy thousand : most strange to see ; with flags
flying , bayonets fixed ; with Proclamation , and d &apos;Artois Commission of
civil war ! Let some Rebecqui , or other the like hot @-@ clear Patriot ; let
some &apos; Lieutenant @-@ Colonel Aubry , &apos; if Rebecqui is busy elsewhere , raise
instantaneous National Guards , and disperse and dissolve it ; and blow
the Old Castle asunder , ( Moniteur , Seance du 15 Juillet 1792 . ) that so ,
if possible , we hear of it no more !

In the Months of February and March , it is recorded , the terror ,
especially of rural France , had risen even to the transcendental pitch :
not far from madness . In Town and Hamlet is rumour ; of war , massacre :
that Austrians , Aristocrats , above all , that The Brigands are close by .
Men quit their houses and huts ; rush fugitive , shrieking , with wife
and child , they know not whither . Such a terror , the eye @-@ witnesses say ,
never fell on a Nation ; nor shall again fall , even in Reigns of Terror
expressly so @-@ called . The Countries of the Loire , all the Central and
South @-@ East regions , start up distracted , &apos; simultaneously as by an
electric shock ; &apos; -- for indeed grain too gets scarcer and scarcer . &apos; The
people barricade the entrances of Towns , pile stones in the upper
stories , the women prepare boiling water ; from moment to moment ,
expecting the attack . In the Country , the alarm @-@ bell rings incessant :
troops of peasants , gathered by it , scour the highways , seeking an
imaginary enemy . They are armed mostly with scythes stuck in wood ;
and , arriving in wild troops at the barricaded Towns , are themselves
sometimes taken for Brigands . &apos; ( Newspapers , &amp; c. in Hist . Parl. xiii .
325 . )

So rushes old France : old France is rushing down . What the end will be
is known to no mortal ; that the end is near all mortals may know .



Chapter 2.5.VII.

Constitution will not march .

To all which our poor Legislative , tied up by an unmarching
Constitution , can oppose nothing , by way of remedy , but mere bursts of
parliamentary eloquence ! They go on , debating , denouncing , objurgating :
loud weltering Chaos , which devours itself .

But their two thousand and odd Decrees ? Reader , these happily concern
not thee , nor me . Mere Occasional Decrees , foolish and not foolish ;
sufficient for that day was its own evil ! Of the whole two thousand
there are not , now half a score , and these mostly blighted in the bud
by royal Veto , that will profit or disprofit us . On the 17th of January ,
the Legislative , for one thing , got its High Court , its Haute Cour ,
set up at Orleans . The theory had been given by the Constituent , in
May last , but this is the reality : a Court for the trial of Political
Offences ; a Court which cannot want work . To this it was decreed that
there needed no royal Acceptance , therefore that there could be no Veto .
Also Priests can now be married ; ever since last October . A patriotic
adventurous Priest had made bold to marry himself then ; and not thinking
this enough , came to the bar with his new spouse ; that the whole world
might hold honey @-@ moon with him , and a Law be obtained .

Less joyful are the Laws against Refractory Priests ; and yet no less
needful ! Decrees on Priests and Decrees on Emigrants : these are the
two brief Series of Decrees , worked out with endless debate , and then
cancelled by Veto , which mainly concern us here . For an august National
Assembly must needs conquer these Refractories , Clerical or Laic , and
thumbscrew them into obedience ; yet , behold , always as you turn your
legislative thumbscrew , and will press and even crush till Refractories
give way , -- King &apos;s Veto steps in , with magical paralysis ; and your
thumbscrew , hardly squeezing , much less crushing , does not act !

Truly a melancholy Set of Decrees , a pair of Sets ; paralysed by
Veto ! First , under date the 28th of October 1791 , we have Legislative
Proclamation , issued by herald and bill @-@ sticker ; inviting Monsieur , the
King &apos;s Brother to return within two months , under penalties . To which
invitation Monsieur replies nothing ; or indeed replies by Newspaper
Parody , inviting the august Legislative &apos; to return to common sense
within two months , &apos; under penalties . Whereupon the Legislative must take
stronger measures . So , on the 9th of November , we declare all Emigrants
to be &apos; suspect of conspiracy ; &apos; and , in brief , to be &apos; outlawed , &apos; if
they have not returned at Newyear &apos;s @-@ day : -- Will the King say Veto ? That
&apos;triple impost &apos; shall be levied on these men &apos;s Properties , or even their
Properties be &apos; put in sequestration , &apos; one can understand . But further ,
on Newyear &apos;s @-@ day itself , not an individual having &apos; returned , &apos; we
declare , and with fresh emphasis some fortnight later again declare ,
That Monsieur is dechu , forfeited of his eventual Heirship to the Crown ;
nay more that Conde , Calonne , and a considerable List of others are
accused of high treason ; and shall be judged by our High Court of
Orleans : Veto ! -- Then again as to Nonjurant Priests : it was decreed , in
November last , that they should forfeit what Pensions they had ; be &apos; put
under inspection , under surveillance , &apos; and , if need were , be banished :
Veto ! A still sharper turn is coming ; but to this also the answer will
be , Veto .

Veto after Veto ; your thumbscrew paralysed ! Gods and men may see that
the Legislative is in a false position . As , alas , who is in a true one ?
Voices already murmur for a &apos; National Convention . &apos; ( December 1791 ( Hist .
Parl. xii . 257 ) . ) This poor Legislative , spurred and stung into action
by a whole France and a whole Europe , cannot act ; can only objurgate
and perorate ; with stormy &apos; motions , &apos; and motion in which is no way : with
effervescence , with noise and fuliginous fury !

What scenes in that National Hall ! President jingling his inaudible
bell ; or , as utmost signal of distress , clapping on his hat ; &apos; the tumult
subsiding in twenty minutes , &apos; and this or the other indiscreet Member
sent to the Abbaye Prison for three days ! Suspected Persons must be
summoned and questioned ; old M. de Sombreuil of the Invalides has to
give account of himself , and why he leaves his Gates open . Unusual
smoke rose from the Sevres Pottery , indicating conspiracy ; the Potters
explained that it was Necklace @-@ Lamotte &apos;s Memoirs , bought up by her
Majesty , which they were endeavouring to suppress by fire , ( Moniteur ,
Seance du 28 Mai 1792 ; Campan , ii . 196 . ) -- which nevertheless he that
runs may still read .

Again , it would seem , Duke de Brissac and the King &apos;s
Constitutional @-@ Guard are &apos; making cartridges secretly in the cellars ; &apos;
a set of Royalists , pure and impure ; black cut @-@ throats many of them ,
picked out of gaming houses and sinks ; in all Six thousand instead of
Eighteen hundred ; who evidently gloom on us every time we enter the
Chateau . ( Dumouriez , ii . 168 . ) Wherefore , with infinite debate , let
Brissac and King &apos;s Guard be disbanded . Disbanded accordingly they are ;
after only two months of existence , for they did not get on foot till
March of this same year . So ends briefly the King &apos;s new Constitutional
Maison Militaire ; he must now be guarded by mere Swiss and blue
Nationals again . It seems the lot of Constitutional things . New
Constitutional Maison Civile he would never even establish , much as
Barnave urged it ; old resident Duchesses sniffed at it , and held aloof ;
on the whole her Majesty thought it not worth while , the Noblesse would
so soon be back triumphant . ( Campan , ii. c . 19 . )

Or , looking still into this National Hall and its scenes , behold Bishop
Torne , a Constitutional Prelate , not of severe morals , demanding that
&apos;religious costumes and such caricatures &apos; be abolished . Bishop Torne
warms , catches fire ; finishes by untying , and indignantly flinging on
the table , as if for gage or bet , his own pontifical cross . Which cross ,
at any rate , is instantly covered by the cross of Te @-@ Deum Fauchet , then
by other crosses , and insignia , till all are stripped ; this clerical
Senator clutching off his skull @-@ cap , that other his frill @-@ collar , -- lest
Fanaticism return on us . ( Moniteur , du 7 Avril 1792 ; Deux Amis , vii .
111 . )

Quick is the movement here ! And then so confused , unsubstantial , you
might call it almost spectral ; pallid , dim , inane , like the Kingdoms
of Dis ! Unruly Liguet , shrunk to a kind of spectre for us , pleads here ,
some cause that he has : amid rumour and interruption , which excel human
patience ; he &apos; tears his papers , and withdraws , &apos; the irascible adust
little man . Nay honourable members will tear their papers , being
effervescent : Merlin of Thionville tears his papers , crying : &quot; So , the
People cannot be saved by you ! &quot; Nor are Deputations wanting : Deputations
of Sections ; generally with complaint and denouncement , always with
Patriot fervour of sentiment : Deputation of Women , pleading that they
also may be allowed to take Pikes , and exercise in the Champ @-@ de @-@ Mars .
Why not , ye Amazons , if it be in you ? Then occasionally , having done our
message and got answer , we &apos; defile through the Hall , singing ca @-@ ira ; &apos;
or rather roll and whirl through it , &apos; dancing our ronde patriotique the
while , &apos; -- our new Carmagnole , or Pyrrhic war @-@ dance and liberty @-@ dance .
Patriot Huguenin , Ex @-@ Advocate , Ex @-@ Carabineer , Ex @-@ Clerk of the
Barriers , comes deputed , with Saint @-@ Antoine at his heels ; denouncing
Anti @-@ patriotism , Famine , Forstalment and Man @-@ eaters ; asks an august
Legislative : &quot; Is there not a tocsin in your hearts against these
mangeurs d &apos;hommes ! &quot; ( See Moniteur , Seances in Hist . Parl. xiii. xiv . )

But above all things , for this is a continual business , the Legislative
has to reprimand the King &apos;s Ministers . Of His Majesty &apos;s Ministers we
have said hitherto , and say , next to nothing . Still more spectral these !
Sorrowful ; of no permanency any of them , none at least since Montmorin
vanished : the &apos; eldest of the King &apos;s Council &apos; is occasionally not ten
days old ! ( Dumouriez , ii . 137 . ) Feuillant @-@ Constitutional , as your
respectable Cahier de Gerville , as your respectable unfortunate
Delessarts ; or Royalist @-@ Constitutional , as Montmorin last Friend
of Necker ; or Aristocrat as Bertrand @-@ Moleville : they flit there
phantom @-@ like , in the huge simmering confusion ; poor shadows , dashed in
the racking winds ; powerless , without meaning ; -- whom the human memory
need not charge itself with .

But how often , we say , are these poor Majesty &apos;s Ministers summoned over ;
to be questioned , tutored ; nay , threatened , almost bullied ! They answer
what , with adroitest simulation and casuistry , they can : of which a
poor Legislative knows not what to make . One thing only is clear , That
Cimmerian Europe is girdling us in ; that France ( not actually dead ,
surely ? ) cannot march . Have a care , ye Ministers ! Sharp Guadet
transfixes you with cross @-@ questions , with sudden Advocate @-@ conclusions ;
the sleeping tempest that is in Vergniaud can be awakened . Restless
Brissot brings up Reports , Accusations , endless thin Logic ; it is
the man &apos;s highday even now . Condorcet redacts , with his firm pen ,
our &apos; Address of the Legislative Assembly to the French Nation . &apos; ( 16th
February 1792 ( Choix des Rapports , viii . 375 @-@ 92 ) . ) Fiery Max Isnard ,
who , for the rest , will &quot; carry not Fire and Sword &quot; on those Cimmerian
Enemies &quot; but Liberty , &quot; -- is for declaring &quot; that we hold Ministers
responsible ; and that by responsibility we mean death , nous entendons la
mort . &quot;

For verily it grows serious : the time presses , and traitors there are .
Bertrand @-@ Moleville has a smooth tongue , the known Aristocrat ; gall
in his heart . How his answers and explanations flow ready ; jesuitic ,
plausible to the ear ! But perhaps the notablest is this , which befel
once when Bertrand had done answering and was withdrawn . Scarcely had
the august Assembly begun considering what was to be done with him , when
the Hall fills with smoke . Thick sour smoke : no oratory , only wheezing
and barking ; -- irremediable ; so that the august Assembly has to adjourn !
( Courrier de Paris , 14 Janvier , 1792 ( Gorsas &apos;s Newspaper ) , in Hist .
Parl. xiii . 83 . ) A miracle ? Typical miracle ? One knows not : only this
one seems to know , that &apos; the Keeper of the Stoves was appointed by
Bertrand &apos; or by some underling of his ! -- O fuliginous confused Kingdom
of Dis , with thy Tantalus @-@ Ixion toils , with thy angry Fire @-@ floods , and
Streams named of Lamentation , why hast thou not thy Lethe too , that so
one might finish ?



Chapter 2.5.VIII.

The Jacobins .

Nevertheless let not Patriotism despair . Have we not , in Paris at least ,
a virtuous Petion , a wholly Patriotic Municipality ? Virtuous Petion ,
ever since November , is Mayor of Paris : in our Municipality , the Public ,
for the Public is now admitted too , may behold an energetic Danton ;
further , an epigrammatic slow @-@ sure Manuel ; a resolute unrepentant
Billaud @-@ Varennes , of Jesuit breeding ; Tallien able @-@ editor ; and nothing
but Patriots , better or worse . So ran the November Elections : to the
joy of most citizens ; nay the very Court supported Petion rather than
Lafayette . And so Bailly and his Feuillants , long waning like the
Moon , had to withdraw then , making some sorrowful obeisance , into
extinction ; -- or indeed into worse , into lurid half @-@ light , grimmed by
the shadow of that Red Flag of theirs , and bitter memory of the
Champ @-@ de @-@ Mars . How swift is the progress of things and men ! Not now
does Lafayette , as on that Federation @-@ day , when his noon was , &apos; press his
sword firmly on the Fatherland &apos;s Altar , &apos; and swear in sight of
France : ah no ; he , waning and setting ever since that hour , hangs now ,
disastrous , on the edge of the horizon ; commanding one of those Three
moulting Crane @-@ flights of Armies , in a most suspected , unfruitful ,
uncomfortable manner !

But , at most , cannot Patriotism , so many thousands strong in this
Metropolis of the Universe , help itself ? Has it not right @-@ hands , pikes ?
Hammering of pikes , which was not to be prohibited by Mayor Bailly , has
been sanctioned by Mayor Petion ; sanctioned by Legislative Assembly .
How not , when the King &apos;s so @-@ called Constitutional Guard &apos; was making
cartridges in secret ? &apos; Changes are necessary for the National Guard
itself ; this whole Feuillant @-@ Aristocrat Staff of the Guard must be
disbanded . Likewise , citizens without uniform may surely rank in the
Guard , the pike beside the musket , in such a time : the &apos; active &apos; citizen
and the passive who can fight for us , are they not both welcome ? -- O
my Patriot friends , indubitably Yes ! Nay the truth is , Patriotism
throughout , were it never so white @-@ frilled , logical , respectable , must
either lean itself heartily on Sansculottism , the black , bottomless ;
or else vanish , in the frightfullest way , to Limbo ! Thus some , with
upturned nose , will altogether sniff and disdain Sansculottism ; others
will lean heartily on it ; nay others again will lean what we call
heartlessly on it : three sorts ; each sort with a destiny corresponding .
( Discours de Bailly , Reponse de Petion ( Moniteur du 20 Novembre 1791 ) . )

In such point of view , however , have we not for the present a Volunteer
Ally , stronger than all the rest : namely , Hunger ? Hunger ; and what
rushing of Panic Terror this and the sum @-@ total of our other miseries may
bring ! For Sansculottism grows by what all other things die of . Stupid
Peter Baille almost made an epigram , though unconsciously , and with the
Patriot world laughing not at it but at him , when he wrote &apos; Tout va
bien ici , le pain manque , All goes well here , victuals not to be had . &apos; 
( Barbaroux , p . 94 . )

Neither , if you knew it , is Patriotism without her Constitution that can
march ; her not impotent Parliament ; or call it , Ecumenic Council , and
General @-@ Assembly of the Jean @-@ Jacques Churches : the MOTHER @-@ SOCIETY ,
namely ! Mother @-@ Society with her three hundred full @-@ grown Daughters ; with
what we can call little Granddaughters trying to walk , in every village
of France , numerable , as Burke thinks , by the hundred thousand . This is
the true Constitution ; made not by Twelve @-@ Hundred august Senators , but
by Nature herself ; and has grown , unconsciously , out of the wants and
the efforts of these Twenty @-@ five Millions of men . They are &apos; Lords of
the Articles , &apos; our Jacobins ; they originate debates for the Legislative ;
discuss Peace and War ; settle beforehand what the Legislative is to
do . Greatly to the scandal of philosophical men , and of most
Historians ; -- who do in that judge naturally , and yet not wisely . A
Governing power must exist : your other powers here are simulacra ; this
power is it .

Great is the Mother @-@ Society : She has had the honour to be denounced by
Austrian Kaunitz ; ( Moniteur , Seance du 29 Mars , 1792 . ) and is all
the dearer to Patriotism . By fortune and valour , she has extinguished
Feuillantism itself , at least the Feuillant Club . This latter , high
as it once carried its head , she , on the 18th of February , has the
satisfaction to see shut , extinct ; Patriots having gone thither , with
tumult , to hiss it out of pain . The Mother Society has enlarged her
locality , stretches now over the whole nave of the Church . Let us glance
in , with the worthy Toulongeon , our old Ex @-@ Constituent Friend , who
happily has eyes to see : &apos; The nave of the Jacobins Church , &apos; says he , &apos; is
changed into a vast Circus , the seats of which mount up circularly like
an amphitheatre to the very groin of the domed roof . A high Pyramid
of black marble , built against one of the walls , which was formerly a
funeral monument , has alone been left standing : it serves now as back to
the Office @-@ bearers &apos; Bureau . Here on an elevated Platform sit President
and Secretaries , behind and above them the white Busts of Mirabeau , of
Franklin , and various others , nay finally of Marat . Facing this is the
Tribune , raised till it is midway between floor and groin of the dome ,
so that the speaker &apos;s voice may be in the centre . From that point ,
thunder the voices which shake all Europe : down below , in silence , are
forging the thunderbolts and the firebrands . Penetrating into this huge
circuit , where all is out of measure , gigantic , the mind cannot repress
some movement of terror and wonder ; the imagination recals those dread
temples which Poetry , of old , had consecrated to the Avenging Deities . &apos; 
( Toulongeon , ii . 124 . )

Scenes too are in this Jacobin Amphitheatre , -- had History time for them .
Flags of the &apos; Three free Peoples of the Universe , &apos; trinal brotherly
flags of England , America , France , have been waved here in concert ; by
London Deputation , of Whigs or Wighs and their Club , on this hand , and
by young French Citizenesses on that ; beautiful sweet @-@ tongued Female
Citizens , who solemnly send over salutation and brotherhood , also
Tricolor stitched by their own needle , and finally Ears of Wheat ;
while the dome rebellows with Vivent les trois peuples libres ! from all
throats : -- a most dramatic scene . Demoiselle Theroigne recites , from that
Tribune in mid air , her persecutions in Austria ; comes leaning on the
arm of Joseph Chenier , Poet Chenier , to demand Liberty for the hapless
Swiss of Chateau @-@ Vieux . ( Debats des Jacobins ( Hist . Parl. xiii . 259,
&amp; c . ) . ) Be of hope , ye Forty Swiss ; tugging there , in the Brest waters ;
not forgotten !

Deputy Brissot perorates from that Tribune ; Desmoulins , our wicked
Camille , interjecting audibly from below , &quot; Coquin ! &quot; Here , though
oftener in the Cordeliers , reverberates the lion @-@ voice of Danton ; grim
Billaud @-@ Varennes is here ; Collot d &apos;Herbois , pleading for the Forty
Swiss ; tearing a passion to rags . Apophthegmatic Manuel winds up in
this pithy way : &quot; A Minister must perish ! &quot; -- to which the Amphitheatre
responds : &quot; Tous , Tous , All , All ! &quot; But the Chief Priest and Speaker of
this place , as we said , is Robespierre , the long @-@ winded incorruptible
man . What spirit of Patriotism dwelt in men in those times , this one
fact , it seems to us , will evince : that fifteen hundred human creatures ,
not bound to it , sat quiet under the oratory of Robespierre ; nay ,
listened nightly , hour after hour , applausive ; and gaped as for the word
of life . More insupportable individual , one would say , seldom opened his
mouth in any Tribune . Acrid , implacable @-@ impotent ; dull @-@ drawling , barren
as the Harmattan @-@ wind ! He pleads , in endless earnest @-@ shallow speech ,
against immediate War , against Woollen Caps or Bonnets Rouges , against
many things ; and is the Trismegistus and Dalai @-@ Lama of Patriot men . Whom
nevertheless a shrill @-@ voiced little man , yet with fine eyes , and a broad
beautifully sloping brow , rises respectfully to controvert : he is , say
the Newspaper Reporters , &apos; M. Louvet , Author of the charming Romance
of Faublas . &apos; Steady , ye Patriots ! Pull not yet two ways ; with a France
rushing panic @-@ stricken in the rural districts , and a Cimmerian Europe
storming in on you !



Chapter 2.5.IX.

Minister Roland .

About the vernal equinox , however , one unexpected gleam of hope does
burst forth on Patriotism : the appointment of a thoroughly Patriot
Ministry . This also his Majesty , among his innumerable experiments
of wedding fire to water , will try . Quod bonum sit . Madame d &apos;Udon &apos;s
Breakfasts have jingled with a new significance ; not even Genevese
Dumont but had a word in it . Finally , on the 15th and onwards to the 23d
day of March , 1792 , when all is negociated , -- this is the blessed issue ;
this Patriot Ministry that we see .

General Dumouriez , with the Foreign Portfolio shall ply Kaunitz and the
Kaiser , in another style than did poor Delessarts ; whom indeed we have
sent to our High Court of Orleans for his sluggishness . War @-@ minister
Narbonne is washed away by the Time @-@ flood ; poor Chevalier de Grave ,
chosen by the Court , is fast washing away : then shall austere Servan ,
able Engineer @-@ Officer , mount suddenly to the War Department . Genevese
Claviere sees an old omen realized : passing the Finance Hotel , long
years ago , as a poor Genevese Exile , it was borne wondrously on his
mind that he was to be Finance Minister ; and now he is it ; -- and his poor
Wife , given up by the Doctors , rises and walks , not the victim of nerves
but their vanquisher . ( Dumont , c . 20 , 21 . ) And above all , our Minister
of the Interior ? Roland de la Platriere , he of Lyons ! So have the
Brissotins , public or private Opinion , and Breakfasts in the Place
Vendome decided it . Strict Roland , compared to a Quaker endimanche , or
Sunday Quaker , goes to kiss hands at the Tuileries , in round hat and
sleek hair , his shoes tied with mere riband or ferrat ! The Supreme
Usher twitches Dumouriez aside : &quot; Quoi , Monsieur ! No buckles to his
shoes ? &quot; -- &quot; Ah , Monsieur , &quot; answers Dumouriez , glancing towards the ferrat :
&quot; All is lost , Tout est perdu . &quot; ( Madame Roland , ii . 80 @-@ 115 . )

And so our fair Roland removes from her upper floor in the Rue
Saint @-@ Jacques , to the sumptuous saloons once occupied by Madame Necker .
Nay still earlier , it was Calonne that did all this gilding ; it was he
who ground these lustres , Venetian mirrors ; who polished this inlaying ,
this veneering and or @-@ moulu ; and made it , by rubbing of the proper
lamp , an Aladdin &apos;s Palace : -- and now behold , he wanders dim @-@ flitting over
Europe , half @-@ drowned in the Rhine @-@ stream , scarcely saving his Papers !
Vos non vobis . -- The fair Roland , equal to either fortune , has her public
Dinner on Fridays , the Ministers all there in a body : she withdraws to
her desk ( the cloth once removed ) , and seems busy writing ; nevertheless
loses no word : if for example Deputy Brissot and Minister Claviere
get too hot in argument , she , not without timidity , yet with a cunning
gracefulness , will interpose . Deputy Brissot &apos;s head , they say , is
getting giddy , in this sudden height : as feeble heads do .

Envious men insinuate that the Wife Roland is Minister , and not the
Husband : it is happily the worst they have to charge her with . For
the rest , let whose head soever be getting giddy , it is not this brave
woman &apos;s . Serene and queenly here , as she was of old in her own
hired garret of the Ursulines Convent ! She who has quietly shelled
French @-@ beans for her dinner ; being led to that , as a young maiden , by
quiet insight and computation ; and knowing what that was , and what she
was : such a one will also look quietly on or @-@ moulu and veneering , not
ignorant of these either . Calonne did the veneering : he gave dinners
here , old Besenval diplomatically whispering to him ; and was great : yet
Calonne we saw at last &apos; walk with long strides . &apos; Necker next : and where
now is Necker ? Us also a swift change has brought hither ; a swift change
will send us hence . Not a Palace but a Caravansera !

So wags and wavers this unrestful World , day after day , month
after month . The Streets of Paris , and all Cities , roll daily their
oscillatory flood of men ; which flood does , nightly , disappear , and lie
hidden horizontal in beds and trucklebeds ; and awakes on the morrow
to new perpendicularity and movement . Men go their roads , foolish or
wise ; -- Engineer Goguelat to and fro , bearing Queen &apos;s cipher . A Madame
de Stael is busy ; cannot clutch her Narbonne from the Time @-@ flood : a
Princess de Lamballe is busy ; cannot help her Queen . Barnave , seeing
the Feuillants dispersed , and Coblentz so brisk , begs by way of final
recompence to kiss her Majesty &apos;s hand ; augurs not well of her new
course ; and retires home to Grenoble , to wed an heiress there . The Cafe
Valois and Meot the Restaurateur &apos;s hear daily gasconade ; loud babble
of Half @-@ pay Royalists , with or without Poniards ; remnants of Aristocrat
saloons call the new Ministry Ministere @-@ Sansculotte . A Louvet , of the
Romance Faublas , is busy in the Jacobins . A Cazotte , of the Romance
Diable Amoureux , is busy elsewhere : better wert thou quiet , old Cazotte ;
it is a world , this , of magic become real ! All men are busy ; doing
they only half guess what : -- flinging seeds , of tares mostly , into the
&quot; Seed @-@ field of TIME &quot; this , by and by , will declare wholly what .

But Social Explosions have in them something dread , and as it were mad
and magical : which indeed Life always secretly has ; thus the dumb Earth
( says Fable ) , if you pull her mandrake @-@ roots , will give a daemonic
mad @-@ making moan . These Explosions and Revolts ripen , break forth like
dumb dread Forces of Nature ; and yet they are Men &apos;s forces ; and yet we
are part of them : the Daemonic that is in man &apos;s life has burst out on
us , will sweep us too away ! -- One day here is like another , and yet it is
not like but different . How much is growing , silently resistless , at all
moments ! Thoughts are growing ; forms of Speech are growing , and Customs
and even Costumes ; still more visibly are actions and transactions
growing , and that doomed Strife , of France with herself and with the
whole world .

The word Liberty is never named now except in conjunction with another ;
Liberty and Equality . In like manner , what , in a reign of Liberty and
Equality , can these words , &apos; Sir , &apos; &apos; obedient Servant , &apos; &apos; Honour to be , &apos;
and such like , signify ? Tatters and fibres of old Feudality ; which , were
it only in the Grammatical province , ought to be rooted out ! The Mother
Society has long since had proposals to that effect : these she could
not entertain , not at the moment . Note too how the Jacobin Brethren are
mounting new symbolical headgear : the Woollen Cap or Nightcap , bonnet de
laine , better known as bonnet rouge , the colour being red . A thing
one wears not only by way of Phrygian Cap @-@ of @-@ Liberty , but also for
convenience &apos; sake , and then also in compliment to the Lower @-@ class
Patriots and Bastille @-@ Heroes ; for the Red Nightcap combines all the
three properties . Nay cockades themselves begin to be made of wool , of
tricolor yarn : the riband @-@ cockade , as a symptom of Feuillant Upper @-@ class
temper , is becoming suspicious . Signs of the times .

Still more , note the travail @-@ throes of Europe : or , rather , note the
birth she brings ; for the successive throes and shrieks , of Austrian
and Prussian Alliance , of Kaunitz Anti @-@ jacobin Despatch , of French
Ambassadors cast out , and so forth , were long to note . Dumouriez
corresponds with Kaunitz , Metternich , or Cobentzel , in another style
that Delessarts did . Strict becomes stricter ; categorical answer , as to
this Coblentz work and much else , shall be given . Failing which ? Failing
which , on the 20th day of April 1792 , King and Ministers step over to
the Salle de Manege ; promulgate how the matter stands ; and poor Louis ,
&apos;with tears in his eyes , &apos; proposes that the Assembly do now decree War .
After due eloquence , War is decreed that night .

War , indeed ! Paris came all crowding , full of expectancy , to the
morning , and still more to the evening session . D &apos;Orleans with his two
sons , is there ; looks on , wide @-@ eyed , from the opposite Gallery . ( Deux
Amis , vii . 146 @-@ 66 . ) Thou canst look , O Philippe : it is a War big with
issues , for thee and for all men . Cimmerian Obscurantism and this thrice
glorious Revolution shall wrestle for it , then : some Four @-@ and @-@ twenty
years ; in immeasurable Briareus &apos; wrestle ; trampling and tearing ; before
they can come to any , not agreement , but compromise , and approximate
ascertainment each of what is in the other .

Let our Three Generals on the Frontiers look to it , therefore ; and poor
Chevalier de Grave , the Warminister , consider what he will do . What is
in the three Generals and Armies we may guess . As for poor Chevalier de
Grave , he , in this whirl of things all coming to a press and pinch upon
him , loses head , and merely whirls with them , in a totally distracted
manner ; signing himself at last , &apos; De Grave , Mayor of Paris : &apos; whereupon
he demits , returns over the Channel , to walk in Kensington Gardens ;
( Dumont , c . 19 , 21 . ) and austere Servan , the able Engineer @-@ Officer , is
elevated in his stead . To the post of Honour ? To that of Difficulty , at
least .



Chapter 2.5.X.

Petion @-@ National @-@ Pique .

And yet , how , on dark bottomless Cataracts there plays the foolishest
fantastic @-@ coloured spray and shadow ; hiding the Abyss under vapoury
rainbows ! Alongside of this discussion as to Austrian @-@ Prussian War ,
there goes on no less but more vehemently a discussion , Whether the
Forty or Two @-@ and @-@ forty Swiss of Chateau @-@ Vieux shall be liberated from
the Brest Gallies ? And then , Whether , being liberated , they shall have a
public Festival , or only private ones ?

Theroigne , as we saw , spoke ; and Collot took up the tale . Has not
Bouille &apos;s final display of himself , in that final Night of Spurs ,
stamped your so @-@ called &apos; Revolt of Nanci &apos; into a &apos; Massacre of Nanci , &apos;
for all Patriot judgments ? Hateful is that massacre ; hateful the
Lafayette @-@ Feuillant &apos; public thanks &apos; given for it ! For indeed , Jacobin
Patriotism and dispersed Feuillantism are now at death @-@ grips ; and do
fight with all weapons , even with scenic shows . The walls of Paris ,
accordingly , are covered with Placard and Counter @-@ Placard , on the
subject of Forty Swiss blockheads . Journal responds to Journal ; Player
Collot to Poetaster Roucher ; Joseph Chenier the Jacobin , squire of
Theroigne , to his Brother Andre the Feuillant ; Mayor Petion to Dupont de
Nemours : and for the space of two months , there is nowhere peace for the
thought of man , -- till this thing be settled .

Gloria in excelsis ! The Forty Swiss are at last got &apos; amnestied . &apos; Rejoice
ye Forty : doff your greasy wool Bonnets , which shall become Caps of
Liberty . The Brest Daughter @-@ Society welcomes you from on board , with
kisses on each cheek : your iron Handcuffs are disputed as Relics of
Saints ; the Brest Society indeed can have one portion , which it will
beat into Pikes , a sort of Sacred Pikes ; but the other portion must
belong to Paris , and be suspended from the dome there , along with the
Flags of the Three Free Peoples ! Such a goose is man ; and cackles over
plush @-@ velvet Grand Monarques and woollen Galley @-@ slaves ; over everything
and over nothing , -- and will cackle with his whole soul merely if others
cackle !

On the ninth morning of April , these Forty Swiss blockheads arrive .
From Versailles ; with vivats heaven @-@ high ; with the affluence of men and
women . To the Townhall we conduct them ; nay to the Legislative
itself , though not without difficulty . They are harangued , bedinnered ,
begifted , -- the very Court , not for conscience &apos; sake , contributing
something ; and their Public Festival shall be next Sunday . Next Sunday
accordingly it is . ( Newspapers of February , March , April , 1792 ; Iambe
d &apos;Andre Chenier sur la Fete des Suisses ; &amp; c . , &amp; c. in Hist . Parl. xiii ,
xiv . ) They are mounted into a &apos; triumphal Car resembling a ship ; &apos; are
carted over Paris , with the clang of cymbals and drums , all mortals
assisting applausive ; carted to the Champ @-@ de @-@ Mars and Fatherland &apos;s
Altar ; and finally carted , for Time always brings deliverance , -- into
invisibility for evermore .

Whereupon dispersed Feuillantism , or that Party which loves Liberty yet
not more than Monarchy , will likewise have its Festival : Festival of
Simonneau , unfortunate Mayor of Etampes , who died for the Law ; most
surely for the Law , though Jacobinism disputes ; being trampled down
with his Red Flag in the riot about grains . At which Festival the Public
again assists , unapplausive : not we .

On the whole , Festivals are not wanting ; beautiful rainbow @-@ spray when
all is now rushing treble @-@ quick towards its Niagara Fall . National
repasts there are ; countenanced by Mayor Petion ; Saint @-@ Antoine , and
the Strong Ones of the Halles defiling through Jacobin Club , &quot; their
felicity , &quot; according to Santerre , &quot; not perfect otherwise ; &quot; singing
many @-@ voiced their ca @-@ ira , dancing their ronde patriotique . Among whom
one is glad to discern Saint @-@ Huruge , expressly &apos; in white hat , &apos; the
Saint @-@ Christopher of the Carmagnole . Nay a certain , Tambour or National
Drummer , having just been presented with a little daughter , determines
to have the new Frenchwoman christened on Fatherland &apos;s Altar then and
there . Repast once over , he accordingly has her christened ; Fauchet the
Te @-@ Deum Bishop acting in chief , Thuriot and honourable persons standing
gossips : by the name , Petion @-@ National @-@ Pique ! ( Patriote @-@ Francais
( Brissot &apos;s Newspaper ) , in Hist . Parl. xiii . 451 . ) Does this remarkable
Citizeness , now past the meridian of life , still walk the Earth ? Or did
she die perhaps of teething ? Universal History is not indifferent .



Chapter 2.5.XI.

The Hereditary Representative .

And yet it is not by carmagnole @-@ dances and singing of ca @-@ ira , that the
work can be done . Duke Brunswick is not dancing carmagnoles , but has his
drill serjeants busy .

On the Frontiers , our Armies , be it treason or not , behave in the worst
way . Troops badly commanded , shall we say ? Or troops intrinsically bad ?
Unappointed , undisciplined , mutinous ; that , in a thirty @-@ years peace ,
have never seen fire ? In any case , Lafayette &apos;s and Rochambeau &apos;s little
clutch , which they made at Austrian Flanders , has prospered as badly
as clutch need do : soldiers starting at their own shadow ; suddenly
shrieking , &quot; On nous trahit , &quot; and flying off in wild panic , at or before
the first shot ; -- managing only to hang some two or three Prisoners they
had picked up , and massacre their own Commander , poor Theobald Dillon ,
driven into a granary by them in the Town of Lille .

And poor Gouvion : he who sat shiftless in that Insurrection of Women !
Gouvion quitted the Legislative Hall and Parliamentary duties , in
disgust and despair , when those Galley @-@ slaves of Chateau @-@ Vieux were
admitted there . He said , &quot; Between the Austrians and the Jacobins there
is nothing but a soldier &apos;s death for it ; &quot; ( Toulongeon , ii . 149 . ) and so ,
&apos;in the dark stormy night , &apos; he has flung himself into the throat of the
Austrian cannon , and perished in the skirmish at Maubeuge on the ninth
of June . Whom Legislative Patriotism shall mourn , with black mortcloths
and melody in the Champ @-@ de @-@ Mars : many a Patriot shiftier , truer none .
Lafayette himself is looking altogether dubious ; in place of beating the
Austrians , is about writing to denounce the Jacobins . Rochambeau ,
all disconsolate , quits the service : there remains only Luckner , the
babbling old Prussian Grenadier .

Without Armies , without Generals ! And the Cimmerian Night , has gathered
itself ; Brunswick preparing his Proclamation ; just about to march ! Let
a Patriot Ministry and Legislative say , what in these circumstances it
will do ? Suppress Internal Enemies , for one thing , answers the Patriot
Legislative ; and proposes , on the 24th of May , its Decree for the
Banishment of Priests . Collect also some nucleus of determined internal
friends , adds War @-@ minister Servan ; and proposes , on the 7th of June , his
Camp of Twenty @-@ thousand . Twenty @-@ thousand National Volunteers ; Five out
of each Canton ; picked Patriots , for Roland has charge of the Interior :
they shall assemble here in Paris ; and be for a defence , cunningly
devised , against foreign Austrians and domestic Austrian Committee
alike . So much can a Patriot Ministry and Legislative do .

Reasonable and cunningly devised as such Camp may , to Servan and
Patriotism , appear , it appears not so to Feuillantism ; to that
Feuillant @-@ Aristocrat Staff of the Paris Guard ; a Staff , one would say
again , which will need to be dissolved . These men see , in this proposed
Camp of Servan &apos;s , an offence ; and even , as they pretend to say , an
insult . Petitions there come , in consequence , from blue Feuillants in
epaulettes ; ill received . Nay , in the end , there comes one Petition ,
called &apos; of the Eight Thousand National Guards : &apos; so many names are on it ;
including women and children . Which famed Petition of the Eight Thousand
is indeed received : and the Petitioners , all under arms , are admitted to
the honours of the sitting , -- if honours or even if sitting there be ;
for the instant their bayonets appear at the one door , the Assembly
&apos;adjourns , &apos; and begins to flow out at the other . ( Moniteur , Seance du 10
Juin 1792 . )

Also , in these same days , it is lamentable to see how National Guards ,
escorting Fete Dieu or Corpus @-@ Christi ceremonial , do collar and smite
down any Patriot that does not uncover as the Hostie passes . They clap
their bayonets to the breast of Cattle @-@ butcher Legendre , a known Patriot
ever since the Bastille days ; and threaten to butcher him ; though he sat
quite respectfully , he says , in his Gig , at a distance of fifty paces ,
waiting till the thing were by . Nay , orthodox females were shrieking to
have down the Lanterne on him . ( Debats des Jacobins in Hist . Parl. xiv .
429 . )

To such height has Feuillantism gone in this Corps . For indeed , are not
their Officers creatures of the chief Feuillant , Lafayette ? The Court
too has , very naturally , been tampering with them ; caressing them ,
ever since that dissolution of the so @-@ called Constitutional Guard . Some
Battalions are altogether &apos; petris , kneaded full &apos; of Feuillantism ,
mere Aristocrats at bottom : for instance , the Battalion of the
Filles @-@ Saint @-@ Thomas , made up of your Bankers , Stockbrokers , and other
Full @-@ purses of the Rue Vivienne . Our worthy old Friend Weber , Queen &apos;s
Foster @-@ brother Weber , carries a musket in that Battalion , -- one may judge
with what degree of Patriotic intention .

Heedless of all which , or rather heedful of all which , the Legislative ,
backed by Patriot France and the feeling of Necessity , decrees this Camp
of Twenty thousand . Decisive though conditional Banishment of malign
Priests , it has already decreed .

It will now be seen , therefore , Whether the Hereditary Representative
is for us or against us ? Whether or not , to all our other woes , this
intolerablest one is to be added ; which renders us not a menaced Nation
in extreme jeopardy and need , but a paralytic Solecism of a Nation ;
sitting wrapped as in dead cerements , of a Constitutional @-@ Vesture that
were no other than a winding @-@ sheet ; our right hand glued to our left : to
wait there , writhing and wriggling , unable to stir from the spot ,
till in Prussian rope we mount to the gallows ? Let the Hereditary
Representative consider it well : The Decree of Priests ? The Camp of
Twenty Thousand ? -- By Heaven , he answers , Veto ! Veto ! -- Strict Roland
hands in his Letter to the King ; or rather it was Madame &apos;s Letter ,
who wrote it all at a sitting ; one of the plainest @-@ spoken Letters ever
handed in to any King . This plain @-@ spoken Letter King Louis has the
benefit of reading overnight . He reads , inwardly digests ; and next
morning , the whole Patriot Ministry finds itself turned out . It is the
13th of June 1792 . ( Madame Roland , ii . 115 . )

Dumouriez the many @-@ counselled , he , with one Duranthon , called Minister
of Justice , does indeed linger for a day or two ; in rather suspicious
circumstances ; speaks with the Queen , almost weeps with her : but in
the end , he too sets off for the Army ; leaving what Un @-@ Patriot or
Semi @-@ Patriot Ministry and Ministries can now accept the helm , to accept
it . Name them not : new quick @-@ changing Phantasms , which shift like
magic @-@ lantern figures ; more spectral than ever !

Unhappy Queen , unhappy Louis ! The two Vetos were so natural : are not the
Priests martyrs ; also friends ? This Camp of Twenty Thousand , could it
be other than of stormfullest Sansculottes ? Natural ; and yet , to France ,
unendurable . Priests that co @-@ operate with Coblentz must go elsewhither
with their martyrdom : stormful Sansculottes , these and no other kind of
creatures , will drive back the Austrians . If thou prefer the Austrians ,
then for the love of Heaven go join them . If not , join frankly with what
will oppose them to the death . Middle course is none .

Or alas , what extreme course was there left now , for a man like Louis ?
Underhand Royalists , Ex @-@ Minister Bertrand @-@ Moleville , Ex @-@ Constituent
Malouet , and all manner of unhelpful individuals , advise and advise .
With face of hope turned now on the Legislative Assembly , and now on
Austria and Coblentz , and round generally on the Chapter of Chances , an
ancient Kingship is reeling and spinning , one knows not whitherward , on
the flood of things .



Chapter 2.5.XII.

Procession of the Black Breeches .

But is there a thinking man in France who , in these circumstances ,
can persuade himself that the Constitution will march ? Brunswick is
stirring ; he , in few days now , will march . Shall France sit still ,
wrapped in dead cerements and grave @-@ clothes , its right hand glued to
its left , till the Brunswick Saint @-@ Bartholomew arrive ; till France be as
Poland , and its Rights of Man become a Prussian Gibbet ?

Verily , it is a moment frightful for all men . National Death ; or else
some preternatural convulsive outburst of National Life ; -- that same ,
daemonic outburst ! Patriots whose audacity has limits had , in truth ,
better retire like Barnave ; court private felicity at Grenoble .
Patriots , whose audacity has no limits must sink down into the obscure ;
and , daring and defying all things , seek salvation in stratagem , in Plot
of Insurrection . Roland and young Barbaroux have spread out the Map
of France before them , Barbaroux says &apos; with tears : &apos; they consider what
Rivers , what Mountain ranges are in it : they will retire behind this
Loire @-@ stream , defend these Auvergne stone @-@ labyrinths ; save some
little sacred Territory of the Free ; die at least in their last ditch .
Lafayette indites his emphatic Letter to the Legislative against
Jacobinism ; ( Moniteur , Seance du 18 Juin 1792 . ) which emphatic Letter
will not heal the unhealable .

Forward , ye Patriots whose audacity has no limits ; it is you now that
must either do or die ! The sections of Paris sit in deep counsel ; send
out Deputation after Deputation to the Salle de Manege , to petition and
denounce . Great is their ire against tyrannous Veto , Austrian Committee ,
and the combined Cimmerian Kings . What boots it ? Legislative listens to
the &apos; tocsin in our hearts ; &apos; grants us honours of the sitting , sees us
defile with jingle and fanfaronade ; but the Camp of Twenty Thousand ,
the Priest @-@ Decree , be @-@ vetoed by Majesty , are become impossible for
Legislative . Fiery Isnard says , &quot; We will have Equality , should we
descend for it to the tomb . &quot; Vergniaud utters , hypothetically , his stern
Ezekiel @-@ visions of the fate of Anti @-@ national Kings . But the question
is : Will hypothetic prophecies , will jingle and fanfaronade demolish
the Veto ; or will the Veto , secure in its Tuileries Chateau , remain
undemolishable by these ? Barbaroux , dashing away his tears , writes to
the Marseilles Municipality , that they must send him &apos; Six hundred men
who know how to die , qui savent mourir . &apos; ( Barbaroux , p . 40 . ) No wet @-@ eyed
message this , but a fire @-@ eyed one ; -- which will be obeyed !

Meanwhile the Twentieth of June is nigh , anniversary of that
world @-@ famous Oath of the Tennis @-@ Court : on which day , it is said ,
certain citizens have in view to plant a Mai or Tree of Liberty , in
the Tuileries Terrace of the Feuillants ; perhaps also to petition the
Legislative and Hereditary Representative about these Vetos ; -- with
such demonstration , jingle and evolution , as may seem profitable and
practicable . Sections have gone singly , and jingled and evolved : but if
they all went , or great part of them , and there , planting their Mai in
these alarming circumstances , sounded the tocsin in their hearts ?

Among King &apos;s Friends there can be but one opinion as to such a step :
among Nation &apos;s Friends there may be two . On the one hand , might it not
by possibility scare away these unblessed Vetos ? Private Patriots
and even Legislative Deputies may have each his own opinion , or own
no @-@ opinion : but the hardest task falls evidently on Mayor Petion and the
Municipals , at once Patriots and Guardians of the public Tranquillity .
Hushing the matter down with the one hand ; tickling it up with
the other ! Mayor Petion and Municipality may lean this way ;
Department @-@ Directory with Procureur @-@ Syndic Roederer having a Feuillant
tendency , may lean that . On the whole , each man must act according to
his one opinion or to his two opinions ; and all manner of influences ,
official representations cross one another in the foolishest way .
Perhaps after all , the Project , desirable and yet not desirable , will
dissipate itself , being run athwart by so many complexities ; and coming
to nothing ?

Not so : on the Twentieth morning of June , a large Tree of Liberty ,
Lombardy Poplar by kind , lies visibly tied on its car , in the
Suburb @-@ Antoine . Suburb Saint @-@ Marceau too , in the uttermost South @-@ East ,
and all that remote Oriental region , Pikemen and Pikewomen , National
Guards , and the unarmed curious are gathering , -- with the peaceablest
intentions in the world . A tricolor Municipal arrives ; speaks . Tush ,
it is all peaceable , we tell thee , in the way of Law : are not Petitions
allowable , and the Patriotism of Mais ? The tricolor Municipal returns
without effect : your Sansculottic rills continue flowing , combining into
brooks : towards noontide , led by tall Santerre in blue uniform , by tall
Saint @-@ Huruge in white hat , it moves Westward , a respectable river , or
complication of still @-@ swelling rivers .

What Processions have we not seen : Corpus @-@ Christi and Legendre waiting
in Gig ; Bones of Voltaire with bullock @-@ chariots , and goadsmen in Roman
Costume ; Feasts of Chateau @-@ Vieux and Simonneau ; Gouvion Funerals ,
Rousseau Sham @-@ Funerals , and the Baptism of Petion @-@ National @-@ Pike !
Nevertheless this Procession has a character of its own . Tricolor
ribands streaming aloft from pike @-@ heads ; ironshod batons ; and emblems
not a few ; among which , see specially these two , of the tragic and
the untragic sort : a Bull &apos;s Heart transfixed with iron , bearing this
epigraph , &apos; Coeur d &apos;Aristocrate , Aristocrat &apos;s Heart ; &apos; and , more striking
still , properly the standard of the host , a pair of old Black Breeches
( silk , they say ) , extended on cross @-@ staff high overhead , with these
memorable words : &apos; Tremblez tyrans , voila les Sansculottes , Tremble
tyrants , here are the Sans @-@ indispensables ! &apos; Also , the Procession trails
two cannons .

Scarfed tricolor Municipals do now again meet it , in the Quai
Saint @-@ Bernard ; and plead earnestly , having called halt . Peaceable , ye
virtuous tricolor Municipals , peaceable are we as the sucking dove .
Behold our Tennis @-@ Court Mai . Petition is legal ; and as for arms , did
not an august Legislative receive the so @-@ called Eight Thousand in arms ,
Feuillants though they were ? Our Pikes , are they not of National iron ?
Law is our father and mother , whom we will not dishonour ; but Patriotism
is our own soul . Peaceable , ye virtuous Municipals ; -- and on the whole ,
limited as to time ! Stop we cannot ; march ye with us . -- The Black
Breeches agitate themselves , impatient ; the cannon @-@ wheels grumble : the
many @-@ footed Host tramps on .

How it reached the Salle de Manege , like an ever @-@ waxing river ; got
admittance , after debate ; read its Address ; and defiled , dancing
and ca @-@ ira @-@ ing , led by tall sonorous Santerre and tall sonorous
Saint @-@ Huruge : how it flowed , not now a waxing river but a shut Caspian
lake , round all Precincts of the Tuileries ; the front Patriot squeezed
by the rearward , against barred iron Grates , like to have the life
squeezed out of him , and looking too into the dread throat of cannon ,
for National Battalions stand ranked within : how tricolor Municipals ran
assiduous , and Royalists with Tickets of Entry ; and both Majesties sat
in the interior surrounded by men in black : all this the human mind
shall fancy for itself , or read in old Newspapers , and Syndic Roederer &apos;s
Chronicle of Fifty Days . ( Roederer , &amp; c . &amp; c. in Hist . Parl. xv .
98 @-@ 194 . )

Our Mai is planted ; if not in the Feuillants Terrace , whither is no
ingate , then in the Garden of the Capuchins , as near as we could get .
National Assembly has adjourned till the Evening Session : perhaps this
shut lake , finding no ingate , will retire to its sources again ; and
disappear in peace ? Alas , not yet : rearward still presses on ; rearward
knows little what pressure is in the front . One would wish at all
events , were it possible , to have a word with his Majesty first !

The shadows fall longer , eastward ; it is four o &apos;clock : will his
Majesty not come out ? Hardly he ! In that case , Commandant Santerre ,
Cattle @-@ butcher Legendre , Patriot Huguenin with the tocsin in his heart ;
they , and others of authority , will enter in . Petition and request to
wearied uncertain National Guard ; louder and louder petition ; backed
by the rattle of our two cannons ! The reluctant Grate opens : endless
Sansculottic multitudes flood the stairs ; knock at the wooden guardian
of your privacy . Knocks , in such case , grow strokes , grow smashings : the
wooden guardian flies in shivers . And now ensues a Scene over which the
world has long wailed ; and not unjustly ; for a sorrier spectacle , of
Incongruity fronting Incongruity , and as it were recognising themselves
incongruous , and staring stupidly in each other &apos;s face , the world seldom
saw .

King Louis , his door being beaten on , opens it ; stands with free bosom ;
asking , &quot; What do you want ? &quot; The Sansculottic flood recoils awestruck ;
returns however , the rear pressing on the front , with cries of &quot; Veto !
Patriot Ministers ! Remove Veto ! &quot; -- which things , Louis valiantly answers ,
this is not the time to do , nor this the way to ask him to do . Honour
what virtue is in a man . Louis does not want courage ; he has even the
higher kind called moral @-@ courage , though only the passive half of that .
His few National Grenadiers shuffle back with him , into the embrasure
of a window : there he stands , with unimpeachable passivity , amid the
shouldering and the braying ; a spectacle to men . They hand him a Red
Cap of Liberty ; he sets it quietly on his head , forgets it there . He
complains of thirst ; half @-@ drunk Rascality offers him a bottle , he drinks
of it . &quot; Sire , do not fear , &quot; says one of his Grenadiers . &quot; Fear ? &quot; answers
Louis : &quot; feel then , &quot; putting the man &apos;s hand on his heart . So stands
Majesty in Red woollen Cap ; black Sansculottism weltering round him , far
and wide , aimless , with in @-@ articulate dissonance , with cries of &quot; Veto !
Patriot Ministers ! &quot;

For the space of three hours or more ! The National Assembly is
adjourned ; tricolor Municipals avail almost nothing : Mayor Petion
tarries absent ; Authority is none . The Queen with her Children and
Sister Elizabeth , in tears and terror not for themselves only , are
sitting behind barricaded tables and Grenadiers in an inner room . The
Men in Black have all wisely disappeared . Blind lake of Sansculottism
welters stagnant through the King &apos;s Chateau , for the space of three
hours .

Nevertheless all things do end . Vergniaud arrives with Legislative
Deputation , the Evening Session having now opened . Mayor Petion has
arrived ; is haranguing , &apos; lifted on the shoulders of two Grenadiers . &apos; 
In this uneasy attitude and in others , at various places without and
within , Mayor Petion harangues ; many men harangue : finally Commandant
Santerre defiles ; passes out , with his Sansculottism , by the opposite
side of the Chateau . Passing through the room where the Queen , with
an air of dignity and sorrowful resignation , sat among the tables and
Grenadiers , a woman offers her too a Red Cap ; she holds it in her hand ,
even puts it on the little Prince Royal . &quot; Madame , &quot; said Santerre , &quot; this
People loves you more than you think . &quot; ( Toulongeon , ii . 173 ; Campan ,
ii. c . 20 . ) -- About eight o &apos;clock the Royal Family fall into each other &apos;s
arms amid &apos; torrents of tears . &apos; Unhappy Family ! Who would not weep for
it , were there not a whole world to be wept for ?

Thus has the Age of Chivalry gone , and that of Hunger come . Thus does
all @-@ needing Sansculottism look in the face of its Roi , Regulator , King
or Ableman ; and find that he has nothing to give it . Thus do the two
Parties , brought face to face after long centuries , stare stupidly at
one another , This am I ; but , Good Heaven , is that thou ? -- and depart ,
not knowing what to make of it . And yet , Incongruities having recognised
themselves to be incongruous , something must be made of it . The Fates
know what .

This is the world @-@ famous Twentieth of June , more worthy to be called the
Procession of the Black Breeches . With which , what we had to say of this
First French biennial Parliament , and its products and activities , may
perhaps fitly enough terminate .




BOOK 2.VI.

THE MARSEILLESE


Chapter 2.6.I.

Executive that does not act .

How could your paralytic National Executive be put &apos; in action , &apos; in any
measure , by such a Twentieth of June as this ? Quite contrariwise : a
large sympathy for Majesty so insulted arises every where ; expresses
itself in Addresses , Petitions &apos; Petition of the Twenty Thousand
inhabitants of Paris , &apos; and such like , among all Constitutional persons ;
a decided rallying round the Throne .

Of which rallying it was thought King Louis might have made something .
However , he does make nothing of it , or attempt to make ; for indeed his
views are lifted beyond domestic sympathy and rallying , over to Coblentz
mainly : neither in itself is the same sympathy worth much . It is
sympathy of men who believe still that the Constitution can march .
Wherefore the old discord and ferment , of Feuillant sympathy for
Royalty , and Jacobin sympathy for Fatherland , acting against each
other from within ; with terror of Coblentz and Brunswick acting from
without : -- this discord and ferment must hold on its course , till a
catastrophe do ripen and come . One would think , especially as Brunswick
is near marching , such catastrophe cannot now be distant . Busy , ye
Twenty @-@ five French Millions ; ye foreign Potentates , minatory Emigrants ,
German drill @-@ serjeants ; each do what his hand findeth ! Thou , O Reader ,
at such safe distance , wilt see what they make of it among them .

Consider therefore this pitiable Twentieth of June as a futility ; no
catastrophe , rather a catastasis , or heightening . Do not its Black
Breeches wave there , in the Historical Imagination , like a melancholy
flag of distress ; soliciting help , which no mortal can give ? Soliciting
pity , which thou wert hard @-@ hearted not to give freely , to one and all !
Other such flags , or what are called Occurrences , and black or bright
symbolic Phenomena ; will flit through the Historical Imagination : these ,
one after one , let us note , with extreme brevity .

The first phenomenon is that of Lafayette at the Bar of the Assembly ;
after a week and day . Promptly , on hearing of this scandalous Twentieth
of June , Lafayette has quitted his Command on the North Frontier , in
better or worse order ; and got hither , on the 28th , to repress the
Jacobins : not by Letter now ; but by oral Petition , and weight
of character , face to face . The august Assembly finds the step
questionable ; invites him meanwhile to the honours of the sitting .
( Moniteur , Seance du 28 Juin 1792 . ) Other honour , or advantage , there
unhappily came almost none ; the Galleries all growling ; fiery Isnard
glooming ; sharp Guadet not wanting in sarcasms .

And out of doors , when the sitting is over , Sieur Resson , keeper of the
Patriot Cafe in these regions , hears in the street a hurly @-@ burly ; steps
forth to look , he and his Patriot customers : it is Lafayette &apos;s carriage ,
with a tumultuous escort of blue Grenadiers , Cannoneers , even Officers
of the Line , hurrahing and capering round it . They make a pause opposite
Sieur Resson &apos;s door ; wag their plumes at him ; nay shake their fists ,
bellowing A bas les Jacobins ; but happily pass on without onslaught .
They pass on , to plant a Mai before the General &apos;s door , and bully
considerably . All which the Sieur Resson cannot but report with sorrow ,
that night , in the Mother Society . ( Debats des Jacobins Hist . Parl .
xv . 235 . ) But what no Sieur Resson nor Mother Society can do more than
guess is this , That a council of rank Feuillants , your unabolished
Staff of the Guard and who else has status and weight , is in these very
moments privily deliberating at the General &apos;s : Can we not put down the
Jacobins by force ? Next day , a Review shall be held , in the Tuileries
Garden , of such as will turn out , and try . Alas , says Toulongeon , hardly
a hundred turned out . Put it off till tomorrow , then , to give better
warning . On the morrow , which is Saturday , there turn out &apos; some thirty ; &apos;
and depart shrugging their shoulders ! ( Toulongeon , ii . 180 . See also
Dampmartin , ii . 161 . ) Lafayette promptly takes carriage again ; returns
musing on my things .

The dust of Paris is hardly off his wheels , the summer Sunday is still
young , when Cordeliers in deputation pluck up that Mai of his : before
sunset , Patriots have burnt him in effigy . Louder doubt and louder
rises , in Section , in National Assembly , as to the legality of such
unbidden Anti @-@ jacobin visit on the part of a General : doubt swelling and
spreading all over France , for six weeks or so : with endless talk about
usurping soldiers , about English Monk , nay about Cromwell : O thou Paris
Grandison @-@ Cromwell ! -- What boots it ? King Louis himself looked coldly on
the enterprize : colossal Hero of two Worlds , having weighed himself
in the balance , finds that he is become a gossamer Colossus , only some
thirty turning out .

In a like sense , and with a like issue , works our Department @-@ Directory
here at Paris ; who , on the 6th of July , take upon them to suspend Mayor
Petion and Procureur Manuel from all civic functions , for their conduct ,
replete , as is alleged , with omissions and commissions , on that delicate
Twentieth of June . Virtuous Petion sees himself a kind of martyr , or
pseudo @-@ martyr , threatened with several things ; drawls out due heroical
lamentation ; to which Patriot Paris and Patriot Legislative duly
respond . King Louis and Mayor Petion have already had an interview on
that business of the Twentieth ; an interview and dialogue , distinguished
by frankness on both sides ; ending on King Louis &apos;s side with the words ,
&quot; Taisez @-@ vous , Hold your peace . &quot;

For the rest , this of suspending our Mayor does seem a mistimed measure .
By ill chance , it came out precisely on the day of that famous Baiser de
l &apos;amourette , or miraculous reconciliatory Delilah @-@ Kiss , which we spoke
of long ago . Which Delilah @-@ Kiss was thereby quite hindered of effect .
For now his Majesty has to write , almost that same night , asking a
reconciled Assembly for advice ! The reconciled Assembly will not advise ;
will not interfere . The King confirms the suspension ; then perhaps , but
not till then will the Assembly interfere , the noise of Patriot Paris
getting loud . Whereby your Delilah @-@ Kiss , such was the destiny of
Parliament First , becomes a Philistine Battle !

Nay there goes a word that as many as Thirty of our chief Patriot
Senators are to be clapped in prison , by mittimus and indictment of
Feuillant Justices , Juges de Paix ; who here in Paris were well capable
of such a thing . It was but in May last that Juge de Paix Lariviere , on
complaint of Bertrand @-@ Moleville touching that Austrian Committee ,
made bold to launch his mittimus against three heads of the Mountain ,
Deputies Bazire , Chabot , Merlin , the Cordelier Trio ; summoning them to
appear before him , and shew where that Austrian Committee was , or else
suffer the consequences . Which mittimus the Trio , on their side ,
made bold to fling in the fire : and valiantly pleaded privilege of
Parliament . So that , for his zeal without knowledge , poor Justice
Lariviere now sits in the prison of Orleans , waiting trial from the
Haute Cour there . Whose example , may it not deter other rash Justices ;
and so this word of the Thirty arrestments continue a word merely ?

But on the whole , though Lafayette weighed so light , and has had his Mai
plucked up , Official Feuillantism falters not a whit ; but carries its
head high , strong in the letter of the Law . Feuillants all of these men :
a Feuillant Directory ; founding on high character , and such like ;
with Duke de la Rochefoucault for President , -- a thing which may prove
dangerous for him ! Dim now is the once bright Anglomania of these
admired Noblemen . Duke de Liancourt offers , out of Normandy where he
is Lord @-@ Lieutenant , not only to receive his Majesty , thinking of flight
thither , but to lend him money to enormous amounts . Sire , it is not
a Revolt , it is a Revolution ; and truly no rose @-@ water one ! Worthier
Noblemen were not in France nor in Europe than those two : but the Time
is crooked , quick @-@ shifting , perverse ; what straightest course will lead
to any goal , in it ?

Another phasis which we note , in these early July days , is that of
certain thin streaks of Federate National Volunteers wending from
various points towards Paris , to hold a new Federation @-@ Festival , or
Feast of Pikes , on the Fourteenth there . So has the National Assembly
wished it , so has the Nation willed it . In this way , perhaps , may we
still have our Patriot Camp in spite of Veto . For cannot these Federes ,
having celebrated their Feast of Pikes , march on to Soissons ; and , there
being drilled and regimented , rush to the Frontiers , or whither we like ?
Thus were the one Veto cunningly eluded !

As indeed the other Veto , about Priests , is also like to be eluded ;
and without much cunning . For Provincial Assemblies , in Calvados as
one instance , are proceeding on their own strength to judge and banish
Antinational Priests . Or still worse without Provincial Assembly ,
a desperate People , as at Bourdeaux , can &apos; hang two of them on the
Lanterne , &apos; on the way towards judgment . ( Hist . Parl. xvi . 259 . ) Pity for
the spoken Veto , when it cannot become an acted one !

It is true , some ghost of a War @-@ minister , or Home @-@ minister , for the
time being , ghost whom we do not name , does write to Municipalities and
King &apos;s Commanders , that they shall , by all conceivable methods , obstruct
this Federation , and even turn back the Federes by force of arms : a
message which scatters mere doubt , paralysis and confusion ; irritates
the poor Legislature ; reduces the Federes as we see , to thin streaks .
But being questioned , this ghost and the other ghosts , What it is then
that they propose to do for saving the country ? -- they answer , That
they cannot tell ; that indeed they for their part have , this morning ,
resigned in a body ; and do now merely respectfully take leave of the
helm altogether . With which words they rapidly walk out of the Hall ,
sortent brusquement de la salle , the &apos; Galleries cheering loudly , &apos; the
poor Legislature sitting &apos; for a good while in silence ! &apos; ( Moniteur ,
Seance du Juillet 1792 . ) Thus do Cabinet @-@ ministers themselves , in
extreme cases , strike work ; one of the strangest omens . Other complete
Cabinet @-@ ministry there will not be ; only fragments , and these changeful ,
which never get completed ; spectral Apparitions that cannot so much as
appear ! King Louis writes that he now views this Federation Feast with
approval ; and will himself have the pleasure to take part in the same .

And so these thin streaks of Federes wend Parisward through a paralytic
France . Thin grim streaks ; not thick joyful ranks , as of old to the
first Feast of Pikes ! No : these poor Federates march now towards Austria
and Austrian Committee , towards jeopardy and forlorn hope ; men of hard
fortune and temper , not rich in the world &apos;s goods . Municipalities ,
paralyzed by War @-@ ministers are shy of affording cash : it may be ,
your poor Federates cannot arm themselves , cannot march , till the
Daughter @-@ Society of the place open her pocket , and subscribe . There will
not have arrived , at the set day , Three thousand of them in all . And
yet , thin and feeble as these streaks of Federates seem , they are
the only thing one discerns moving with any clearness of aim , in this
strange scene . Angry buz and simmer ; uneasy tossing and moaning of a
huge France , all enchanted , spell @-@ bound by unmarching Constitution ,
into frightful conscious and unconscious Magnetic @-@ sleep ; which frightful
Magnetic @-@ sleep must now issue soon in one of two things : Death or
Madness ! The Federes carry mostly in their pocket some earnest cry and
Petition , to have the &apos; National Executive put in action ; &apos; or as a step
towards that , to have the King &apos;s Decheance , King &apos;s Forfeiture , or
at least his Suspension , pronounced . They shall be welcome to the
Legislative , to the Mother of Patriotism ; and Paris will provide for
their lodging .

Decheance , indeed : and , what next ? A France spell @-@ free , a Revolution
saved ; and any thing , and all things next ! so answer grimly Danton and
the unlimited Patriots , down deep in their subterranean region of
Plot , whither they have now dived . Decheance , answers Brissot with the
limited : And if next the little Prince Royal were crowned , and some
Regency of Girondins and recalled Patriot Ministry set over him ? Alas ,
poor Brissot ; looking , as indeed poor man does always , on the nearest
morrow as his peaceable promised land ; deciding what must reach to the
world &apos;s end , yet with an insight that reaches not beyond his own nose !
Wiser are the unlimited subterranean Patriots , who with light for the
hour itself , leave the rest to the gods .

Or were it not , as we now stand , the probablest issue of all , that
Brunswick , in Coblentz , just gathering his huge limbs towards him to
rise , might arrive first ; and stop both Decheance , and theorizing on
it ? Brunswick is on the eve of marching ; with Eighty Thousand , they
say ; fell Prussians , Hessians , feller Emigrants : a General of the Great
Frederick , with such an Army . And our Armies ? And our Generals ? As for
Lafayette , on whose late visit a Committee is sitting and all France
is jarring and censuring , he seems readier to fight us than fight
Brunswick . Luckner and Lafayette pretend to be interchanging corps , and
are making movements ; which Patriotism cannot understand . This only is
very clear , that their corps go marching and shuttling , in the interior
of the country ; much nearer Paris than formerly ! Luckner has ordered
Dumouriez down to him , down from Maulde , and the Fortified Camp there .
Which order the many @-@ counselled Dumouriez , with the Austrians hanging
close on him , he busy meanwhile training a few thousands to stand fire
and be soldiers , declares that , come of it what will , he cannot obey .
( Dumouriez , ii . 1 , 5 . ) Will a poor Legislative , therefore , sanction
Dumouriez ; who applies to it , &apos; not knowing whether there is any
War @-@ ministry ? &apos; Or sanction Luckner and these Lafayette movements ?

The poor Legislative knows not what to do . It decrees , however , that
the Staff of the Paris Guard , and indeed all such Staffs , for they are
Feuillants mostly , shall be broken and replaced . It decrees earnestly in
what manner one can declare that the Country is in Danger . And finally ,
on the 11th of July , the morrow of that day when the Ministry struck
work , it decrees that the Country be , with all despatch , declared in
Danger . Whereupon let the King sanction ; let the Municipality take
measures : if such Declaration will do service , it need not fail .

In Danger , truly , if ever Country was ! Arise , O Country ; or be trodden
down to ignominious ruin ! Nay , are not the chances a hundred to one that
no rising of the Country will save it ; Brunswick , the Emigrants , and
Feudal Europe drawing nigh ?



Chapter 2.6.II.

Let us march .

But to our minds the notablest of all these moving phenomena , is that of
Barbaroux &apos;s &apos; Six Hundred Marseillese who know how to die . &apos; 

Prompt to the request of Barbaroux , the Marseilles Municipality has got
these men together : on the fifth morning of July , the Townhall says ,
&quot; Marchez , abatez le Tyran , March , strike down the Tyrant ; &quot; ( Dampmartin ,
ii . 183 . ) and they , with grim appropriate &quot; Marchons , &quot; are marching . Long
journey , doubtful errand ; Enfans de la Patrie , may a good genius guide
you ! Their own wild heart and what faith it has will guide them : and is
not that the monition of some genius , better or worse ? Five Hundred and
Seventeen able men , with Captains of fifties and tens ; well armed all ,
musket on shoulder , sabre on thigh : nay they drive three pieces of
cannon ; for who knows what obstacles may occur ? Municipalities there
are , paralyzed by War @-@ minister ; Commandants with orders to stop even
Federation Volunteers ; good , when sound arguments will not open a
Town @-@ gate , if you have a petard to shiver it ! They have left their sunny
Phocean City and Sea @-@ haven , with its bustle and its bloom : the thronging
Course , with high @-@ frondent Avenues , pitchy dockyards , almond and olive
groves , orange trees on house @-@ tops , and white glittering bastides that
crown the hills , are all behind them . They wend on their wild way , from
the extremity of French land , through unknown cities , toward an unknown
destiny ; with a purpose that they know .

Much wondering at this phenomenon , and how , in a peaceable trading City ,
so many householders or hearth @-@ holders do severally fling down their
crafts and industrial tools ; gird themselves with weapons of war ,
and set out on a journey of six hundred miles to &apos; strike down the
tyrant , &apos; -- you search in all Historical Books , Pamphlets , and Newspapers ,
for some light on it : unhappily without effect . Rumour and Terror
precede this march ; which still echo on you ; the march itself an unknown
thing . Weber , in the back @-@ stairs of the Tuileries , has understood that
they were Forcats , Galley @-@ slaves and mere scoundrels , these Marseillese ;
that , as they marched through Lyons , the people shut their shops ; -- also
that the number of them was some Four Thousand . Equally vague is Blanc
Gilli , who likewise murmurs about Forcats and danger of plunder . ( See
Barbaroux , Memoires Note in p . 40 , 41 . ) Forcats they were not ;
neither was there plunder , or danger of it . Men of regular life , or of
the best @-@ filled purse , they could hardly be ; the one thing needful in
them was that they &apos; knew how to die . &apos; Friend Dampmartin saw them , with
his own eyes , march &apos; gradually &apos; through his quarters at Villefranche in
the Beaujolais : but saw in the vaguest manner ; being indeed preoccupied ,
and himself minded for matching just then -- across the Rhine . Deep
was his astonishment to think of such a march , without appointment or
arrangement , station or ration : for the rest it was &apos; the same men he had
seen formerly &apos; in the troubles of the South ; &apos; perfectly civil ; &apos;
though his soldiers could not be kept from talking a little with them .
( Dampmartin , ubi supra . )

So vague are all these ; Moniteur , Histoire Parlementaire are as good as
silent : garrulous History , as is too usual , will say nothing where you
most wish her to speak ! If enlightened Curiosity ever get sight of the
Marseilles Council @-@ Books , will it not perhaps explore this strangest
of Municipal procedures ; and feel called to fish up what of the
Biographies , creditable or discreditable , of these Five Hundred and
Seventeen , the stream of Time has not yet irrevocably swallowed ?

As it is , these Marseillese remain inarticulate , undistinguishable in
feature ; a blackbrowed Mass , full of grim fire , who wend there , in the
hot sultry weather : very singular to contemplate . They wend ; amid the
infinitude of doubt and dim peril ; they not doubtful : Fate and Feudal
Europe , having decided , come girdling in from without : they , having also
decided , do march within . Dusty of face , with frugal refreshment , they
plod onwards ; unweariable , not to be turned aside . Such march will
become famous . The Thought , which works voiceless in this blackbrowed
mass , an inspired Tyrtaean Colonel , Rouget de Lille whom the Earth still
holds , ( A.D. 1836 . ) has translated into grim melody and rhythm ; into
his Hymn or March of the Marseillese : luckiest musical @-@ composition ever
promulgated . The sound of which will make the blood tingle in men &apos;s
veins ; and whole Armies and Assemblages will sing it , with eyes weeping
and burning , with hearts defiant of Death , Despot and Devil .

One sees well , these Marseillese will be too late for the Federation
Feast . In fact , it is not Champ @-@ de @-@ Mars Oaths that they have in view .
They have quite another feat to do : a paralytic National Executive
to set in action . They must &apos; strike down &apos; whatsoever &apos; Tyrant , &apos; or
Martyr @-@ Faineant , there may be who paralyzes it ; strike and be struck ;
and on the whole prosper and know how to die .



Chapter 2.6.III.

Some Consolation to Mankind .

Of the Federation Feast itself we shall say almost nothing . There are
Tents pitched in the Champ @-@ de @-@ Mars ; tent for National Assembly ; tent for
Hereditary Representative , -- who indeed is there too early , and has
to wait long in it . There are Eighty @-@ three symbolical Departmental
Trees @-@ of @-@ Liberty ; trees and mais enough : beautifullest of all these
is one huge mai , hung round with effete Scutcheons , Emblazonries
and Genealogy @-@ books ; nay better still , with Lawyers &apos; -bags , &apos; sacs de
procedure : &apos; which shall be burnt . The Thirty seat @-@ rows of that famed
Slope are again full ; we have a bright Sun ; and all is marching ,
streamering and blaring : but what avails it ? Virtuous Mayor Petion , whom
Feuillantism had suspended , was reinstated only last night , by Decree of
the Assembly . Men &apos;s humour is of the sourest . Men &apos;s hats have on them ,
written in chalk , &apos; Vive Petion ; &apos; and even , &apos; Petion or Death , Petion ou
la Mort . &apos; 

Poor Louis , who has waited till five o &apos;clock before the Assembly would
arrive , swears the National Oath this time , with a quilted cuirass under
his waistcoat which will turn pistol @-@ bullets . ( Campan , ii. c . 20 ; De
Stael , ii. c . 7 . ) Madame de Stael , from that Royal Tent , stretches out
the neck in a kind of agony , lest the waving multitudes which receive
him may not render him back alive . No cry of Vive le Roi salutes
the ear ; cries only of Vive Petion ; Petion ou la Mort . The National
Solemnity is as it were huddled by ; each cowering off almost before
the evolutions are gone through . The very Mai with its Scutcheons
and Lawyers &apos; -bags is forgotten , stands unburnt ; till &apos; certain Patriot
Deputies , &apos; called by the people , set a torch to it , by way of voluntary
after @-@ piece . Sadder Feast of Pikes no man ever saw .

Mayor Petion , named on hats , is at his zenith in this Federation ;
Lafayette again is close upon his nadir . Why does the stormbell of
Saint @-@ Roch speak out , next Saturday ; why do the citizens shut their
shops ? ( Moniteur , Seance du 21 Juillet 1792 . ) It is Sections defiling ,
it is fear of effervescence . Legislative Committee , long deliberating
on Lafayette and that Anti @-@ jacobin Visit of his , reports , this day , that
there is &apos; not ground for Accusation ! &apos; Peace , ye Patriots , nevertheless ;
and let that tocsin cease : the Debate is not finished , nor the Report
accepted ; but Brissot , Isnard and the Mountain will sift it , and resift
it , perhaps for some three weeks longer .

So many bells , stormbells and noises do ring ; -- scarcely audible ; one
drowning the other . For example : in this same Lafayette tocsin , of
Saturday , was there not withal some faint bob @-@ minor , and Deputation of
Legislative , ringing the Chevalier Paul Jones to his long rest ; tocsin
or dirge now all one to him ! Not ten days hence Patriot Brissot ,
beshouted this day by the Patriot Galleries , shall find himself
begroaned by them , on account of his limited Patriotism ; nay pelted at
while perorating , and &apos; hit with two prunes . &apos; ( Hist . Parl. xvi . 185 . ) It
is a distracted empty @-@ sounding world ; of bob @-@ minors and bob @-@ majors , of
triumph and terror , of rise and fall !

The more touching is this other Solemnity , which happens on the morrow
of the Lafayette tocsin : Proclamation that the Country is in Danger . Not
till the present Sunday could such Solemnity be . The Legislative decreed
it almost a fortnight ago ; but Royalty and the ghost of a Ministry held
back as they could . Now however , on this Sunday , 22nd day of July 1792,
it will hold back no longer ; and the Solemnity in very deed is . Touching
to behold ! Municipality and Mayor have on their scarfs ; cannon @-@ salvo
booms alarm from the Pont @-@ Neuf , and single @-@ gun at intervals all day .
Guards are mounted , scarfed Notabilities , Halberdiers , and a Cavalcade ;
with streamers , emblematic flags ; especially with one huge Flag ,
flapping mournfully : Citoyens , la Patrie est en Danger . They roll
through the streets , with stern @-@ sounding music , and slow rattle of
hoofs : pausing at set stations , and with doleful blast of trumpet ,
singing out through Herald &apos;s throat , what the Flag says to the eye :
&quot; Citizens , the Country is in Danger ! &quot;

Is there a man &apos;s heart that hears it without a thrill ? The many @-@ voiced
responsive hum or bellow of these multitudes is not of triumph ; and
yet it is a sound deeper than triumph . But when the long Cavalcade
and Proclamation ended ; and our huge Flag was fixed on the Pont Neuf ,
another like it on the Hotel @-@ de @-@ Ville , to wave there till better days ;
and each Municipal sat in the centre of his Section , in a Tent raised
in some open square , Tent surmounted with flags of Patrie en danger , and
topmost of all a Pike and Bonnet Rouge ; and , on two drums in front of
him , there lay a plank @-@ table , and on this an open Book , and a Clerk sat ,
like recording @-@ angel , ready to write the Lists , or as we say to enlist !
O , then , it seems , the very gods might have looked down on it . Young
Patriotism , Culottic and Sansculottic , rushes forward emulous : That is
my name ; name , blood , and life , is all my Country &apos;s ; why have I nothing
more ! Youths of short stature weep that they are below size . Old men
come forward , a son in each hand . Mothers themselves will grant the son
of their travail ; send him , though with tears . And the multitude bellows
Vive la Patrie , far reverberating . And fire flashes in the eyes of
men ; -- and at eventide , your Municipal returns to the Townhall , followed
by his long train of volunteer Valour ; hands in his List : says proudly ,
looking round . This is my day &apos;s harvest . ( Tableau de la Revolution , para
Patrie en Danger . ) They will march , on the morrow , to Soissons ; small
bundle holding all their chattels .

So , with Vive la Patrie , Vive la Liberte , stone Paris reverberates like
Ocean in his caves ; day after day , Municipals enlisting in tricolor
Tent ; the Flag flapping on Pont Neuf and Townhall , Citoyens , la Patrie
est en Danger . Some Ten thousand fighters , without discipline but full
of heart , are on march in few days . The like is doing in every Town of
France . -- Consider therefore whether the Country will want defenders , had
we but a National Executive ? Let the Sections and Primary Assemblies ,
at any rate , become Permanent , and sit continually in Paris , and over
France , by Legislative Decree dated Wednesday the 25th . ( Moniteur ,
Seance du 25 Juillet 1792 . )

Mark contrariwise how , in these very hours , dated the 25th , Brunswick
shakes himself &apos; s &apos;ebranle , &apos; in Coblentz ; and takes the road ! Shakes
himself indeed ; one spoken word becomes such a shaking . Successive ,
simultaneous dirl of thirty thousand muskets shouldered ; prance and
jingle of ten @-@ thousand horsemen , fanfaronading Emigrants in the van ;
drum , kettle @-@ drum ; noise of weeping , swearing ; and the immeasurable
lumbering clank of baggage @-@ waggons and camp @-@ kettles that groan into
motion : all this is Brunswick shaking himself ; not without all this does
the one man march , &apos; covering a space of forty miles . &apos; Still less without
his Manifesto , dated , as we say , the 25th ; a State @-@ Paper worthy of
attention !

By this Document , it would seem great things are in store for France .
The universal French People shall now have permission to rally round
Brunswick and his Emigrant Seigneurs ; tyranny of a Jacobin Faction shall
oppress them no more ; but they shall return , and find favour with
their own good King ; who , by Royal Declaration ( three years ago ) of the
Twenty @-@ third of June , said that he would himself make them happy . As for
National Assembly , and other Bodies of Men invested with some temporary
shadow of authority , they are charged to maintain the King &apos;s Cities and
Strong Places intact , till Brunswick arrive to take delivery of them .
Indeed , quick submission may extenuate many things ; but to this end
it must be quick . Any National Guard or other unmilitary person found
resisting in arms shall be &apos; treated as a traitor ; &apos; that is to say ,
hanged with promptitude . For the rest , if Paris , before Brunswick gets
thither , offer any insult to the King : or , for example , suffer a faction
to carry the King away elsewhither ; in that case Paris shall be blasted
asunder with cannon @-@ shot and &apos; military execution . &apos; Likewise all other
Cities , which may witness , and not resist to the uttermost , such
forced @-@ march of his Majesty , shall be blasted asunder ; and Paris and
every City of them , starting @-@ place , course and goal of said sacrilegious
forced @-@ march , shall , as rubbish and smoking ruin , lie there for a sign .
Such vengeance were indeed signal , &apos; an insigne vengeance : &apos; -- O Brunswick ,
what words thou writest and blusterest ! In this Paris , as in old
Nineveh , are so many score thousands that know not the right hand from
the left , and also much cattle . Shall the very milk @-@ cows , hard @-@ living
cadgers &apos; -asses , and poor little canary @-@ birds die ?

Nor is Royal and Imperial Prussian @-@ Austrian Declaration wanting : setting
forth , in the amplest manner , their Sanssouci @-@ Schonbrunn version of this
whole French Revolution , since the first beginning of it ; and with
what grief these high heads have seen such things done under the Sun :
however , &apos; as some small consolation to mankind , &apos; ( Annual Register
( 1792 ) , p . 236 . ) they do now despatch Brunswick ; regardless of expense ,
as one might say , of sacrifices on their own part ; for is it not the
first duty to console men ?

Serene Highnesses , who sit there protocolling and manifestoing , and
consoling mankind ! how were it if , for once in the thousand years , your
parchments , formularies , and reasons of state were blown to the four
winds ; and Reality Sans @-@ indispensables stared you , even you , in the
face ; and Mankind said for itself what the thing was that would console
it ? --



Chapter 2.6.IV.

Subterranean .

But judge if there was comfort in this to the Sections all sitting
permanent ; deliberating how a National Executive could be put in action !

High rises the response , not of cackling terror , but of crowing
counter @-@ defiance , and Vive la Nation ; young Valour streaming towards the
Frontiers ; Patrie en Danger mutely beckoning on the Pont Neuf . Sections
are busy , in their permanent Deep ; and down , lower still , works
unlimited Patriotism , seeking salvation in plot . Insurrection , you would
say , becomes once more the sacredest of duties ? Committee , self @-@ chosen ,
is sitting at the Sign of the Golden Sun : Journalist Carra , Camille
Desmoulins , Alsatian Westermann friend of Danton , American Fournier
of Martinique ; -- a Committee not unknown to Mayor Petion , who , as an
official person , must sleep with one eye open . Not unknown to Procureur
Manuel ; least of all to Procureur @-@ Substitute Danton ! He , wrapped in
darkness , being also official , bears it on his giant shoulder ; cloudy
invisible Atlas of the whole .

Much is invisible ; the very Jacobins have their reticences . Insurrection
is to be : but when ? This only we can discern , that such Federes as are
not yet gone to Soissons , as indeed are not inclined to go yet , &quot; for
reasons , &quot; says the Jacobin President , &quot; which it may be interesting not
to state , &quot; have got a Central Committee sitting close by , under the roof
of the Mother Society herself . Also , what in such ferment and danger of
effervescence is surely proper , the Forty @-@ eight Sections have got their
Central Committee ; intended &apos; for prompt communication . &apos; To which Central
Committee the Municipality , anxious to have it at hand , could not refuse
an Apartment in the Hotel @-@ de @-@ Ville .

Singular City ! For overhead of all this , there is the customary baking
and brewing ; Labour hammers and grinds . Frilled promenaders saunter
under the trees ; white @-@ muslin promenaderess , in green parasol , leaning
on your arm . Dogs dance , and shoeblacks polish , on that Pont Neuf
itself , where Fatherland is in danger . So much goes its course ; and yet
the course of all things is nigh altering and ending .

Look at that Tuileries and Tuileries Garden . Silent all as Sahara ; none
entering save by ticket ! They shut their Gates , after the Day of
the Black Breeches ; a thing they had the liberty to do . However , the
National Assembly grumbled something about Terrace of the Feuillants ,
how said Terrace lay contiguous to the back entrance to their Salle , and
was partly National Property ; and so now National Justice has stretched
a Tricolor Riband athwart , by way of boundary @-@ line , respected with
splenetic strictness by all Patriots . It hangs there that Tricolor
boundary @-@ line ; carries &apos; satirical inscriptions on cards , &apos; generally
in verse ; and all beyond this is called Coblentz , and remains vacant ;
silent , as a fateful Golgotha ; sunshine and umbrage alternating on it in
vain . Fateful Circuit ; what hope can dwell in it ? Mysterious Tickets
of Entry introduce themselves ; speak of Insurrection very imminent .
Rivarol &apos;s Staff of Genius had better purchase blunderbusses ; Grenadier
bonnets , red Swiss uniforms may be useful . Insurrection will come ; but
likewise will it not be met ? Staved off , one may hope , till Brunswick
arrive ?

But consider withal if the Bourne @-@ stones and Portable chairs remain
silent ; if the Herald &apos;s College of Bill @-@ Stickers sleep ! Louvet &apos;s
Sentinel warns gratis on all walls ; Sulleau is busy : People &apos;s @-@ Friend
Marat and King &apos;s @-@ Friend Royou croak and counter @-@ croak . For the man
Marat , though long hidden since that Champ @-@ de @-@ Mars Massacre , is still
alive . He has lain , who knows in what Cellars ; perhaps in Legendre &apos;s ;
fed by a steak of Legendre &apos;s killing : but , since April , the bull @-@ frog
voice of him sounds again ; hoarsest of earthly cries . For the present ,
black terror haunts him : O brave Barbaroux wilt thou not smuggle me to
Marseilles , &apos; disguised as a jockey ? &apos; ( Barbaroux , p . 60 . ) In Palais @-@ Royal
and all public places , as we read , there is sharp activity ; private
individuals haranguing that Valour may enlist ; haranguing that the
Executive may be put in action . Royalist journals ought to be solemnly
burnt : argument thereupon ; debates which generally end in single @-@ stick ,
coups de cannes . ( Newspapers , Narratives and Documents Hist . Parl .
xv . 240 ; xvi . 399 . ) Or think of this ; the hour midnight ; place Salle de
Manege ; august Assembly just adjourning : &apos; Citizens of both sexes
enter in a rush exclaiming , Vengeance : they are poisoning our
Brothers ; &apos; -- baking brayed @-@ glass among their bread at Soissons ! Vergniaud
has to speak soothing words , How Commissioners are already sent to
investigate this brayed @-@ glass , and do what is needful therein : till the
rush of Citizens &apos; makes profound silence : &apos; and goes home to its bed .

Such is Paris ; the heart of a France like to it . Preternatural
suspicion , doubt , disquietude , nameless anticipation , from shore to
shore : -- and those blackbrowed Marseillese , marching , dusty , unwearied ,
through the midst of it ; not doubtful they . Marching to the grim music
of their hearts , they consume continually the long road , these three
weeks and more ; heralded by Terror and Rumour . The Brest Federes arrive
on the 26th ; through hurrahing streets . Determined men are these also ,
bearing or not bearing the Sacred Pikes of Chateau @-@ Vieux ; and on the
whole decidedly disinclined for Soissons as yet . Surely the Marseillese
Brethren do draw nigher all days .



Chapter 2.6.V.

At Dinner .

It was a bright day for Charenton , that 29th of the month , when the
Marseillese Brethren actually came in sight . Barbaroux , Santerre and
Patriots have gone out to meet the grim Wayfarers . Patriot clasps dusty
Patriot to his bosom ; there is footwashing and refection : &apos; dinner of
twelve hundred covers at the Blue Dial , Cadran Bleu ; &apos; and deep
interior consultation , that one wots not of . ( Deux Amis , viii . 90 @-@ 101 . )
Consultation indeed which comes to little ; for Santerre , with an open
purse , with a loud voice , has almost no head . Here however we repose
this night : on the morrow is public entry into Paris .

On which public entry the Day @-@ Historians , Diurnalists , or Journalists
as they call themselves , have preserved record enough . How Saint @-@ Antoine
male and female , and Paris generally , gave brotherly welcome , with bravo
and hand @-@ clapping , in crowded streets ; and all passed in the peaceablest
manner ; -- except it might be our Marseillese pointed out here and there
a riband @-@ cockade , and beckoned that it should be snatched away , and
exchanged for a wool one ; which was done . How the Mother Society in a
body has come as far as the Bastille @-@ ground , to embrace you . How you
then wend onwards , triumphant , to the Townhall , to be embraced by Mayor
Petion ; to put down your muskets in the Barracks of Nouvelle France ,
not far off ; -- then towards the appointed Tavern in the Champs Elysees to
enjoy a frugal Patriot repast . ( Hist . Parl. xvi . 196 . See Barbaroux , p .
51 @-@ 5 . )

Of all which the indignant Tuileries may , by its Tickets of Entry , have
warning . Red Swiss look doubly sharp to their Chateau @-@ Grates ; -- though
surely there is no danger ? Blue Grenadiers of the Filles @-@ Saint @-@ Thomas
Section are on duty there this day : men of Agio , as we have seen ; with
stuffed purses , riband @-@ cockades ; among whom serves Weber . A party of
these latter , with Captains , with sundry Feuillant Notabilities , Moreau
de Saint @-@ Mery of the three thousand orders , and others , have been
dining , much more respectably , in a Tavern hard by . They have dined ,
and are now drinking Loyal @-@ Patriotic toasts ; while the Marseillese ,
National @-@ Patriotic merely , are about sitting down to their frugal covers
of delf . How it happened remains to this day undemonstrable : but the
external fact is , certain of these Filles @-@ Saint @-@ Thomas Grenadiers do
issue from their Tavern ; perhaps touched , surely not yet muddled
with any liquor they have had ; -- issue in the professed intention of
testifying to the Marseillese , or to the multitude of Paris Patriots who
stroll in these spaces , That they , the Filles @-@ Saint @-@ Thomas men , if well
seen into , are not a whit less Patriotic than any other class of men
whatever .

It was a rash errand ! For how can the strolling multitudes credit such
a thing ; or do other indeed than hoot at it , provoking , and
provoked ; -- till Grenadier sabres stir in the scabbard , and a sharp
shriek rises : &quot; A nous Marseillais , Help Marseillese ! &quot; Quick as
lightning , for the frugal repast is not yet served , that Marseillese
Tavern flings itself open : by door , by window ; running , bounding ,
vault forth the Five hundred and Seventeen undined Patriots ; and , sabre
flashing from thigh , are on the scene of controversy . Will ye parley ,
ye Grenadier Captains and official Persons ; &apos; with faces grown suddenly
pale , &apos; the Deponents say ? ( Moniteur , Seances du 30 , du 31 Juillet 1792
Hist . Parl. xvi . 197 @-@ 210 . ) Advisabler were instant moderately swift
retreat ! The Filles @-@ Saint @-@ Thomas retreat , back foremost ; then , alas ,
face foremost , at treble @-@ quick time ; the Marseillese , according to
a Deponent , &quot; clearing the fences and ditches after them like lions :
Messieurs , it was an imposing spectacle . &quot;

Thus they retreat , the Marseillese following . Swift and swifter , towards
the Tuileries : where the Drawbridge receives the bulk of the fugitives ;
and , then suddenly drawn up , saves them ; or else the green mud of the
Ditch does it . The bulk of them ; not all ; ah , no ! Moreau de Saint @-@ Mery
for example , being too fat , could not fly fast ; he got a stroke ,
flat @-@ stroke only , over the shoulder @-@ blades , and fell prone ; -- and
disappears there from the History of the Revolution . Cuts also there
were , pricks in the posterior fleshy parts ; much rending of skirts ,
and other discrepant waste . But poor Sub @-@ lieutenant Duhamel , innocent
Change @-@ broker , what a lot for him ! He turned on his pursuer , or
pursuers , with a pistol ; he fired and missed ; drew a second pistol ,
and again fired and missed ; then ran : unhappily in vain . In the Rue
Saint @-@ Florentin , they clutched him ; thrust him through , in red rage :
that was the end of the New Era , and of all Eras , to poor Duhamel .

Pacific readers can fancy what sort of grace @-@ before @-@ meat this was to
frugal Patriotism . Also how the Battalion of the Filles @-@ Saint @-@ Thomas
&apos;drew out in arms , &apos; luckily without further result ; how there was
accusation at the Bar of the Assembly , and counter @-@ accusation and
defence ; Marseillese challenging the sentence of free jury court , -- which
never got to a decision . We ask rather , What the upshot of all these
distracted wildly accumulating things may , by probability , be ? Some
upshot ; and the time draws nigh ! Busy are Central Committees , of Federes
at the Jacobins Church , of Sections at the Townhall ; Reunion of Carra ,
Camille and Company at the Golden Sun . Busy : like submarine deities , or
call them mud @-@ gods , working there in the deep murk of waters : till the
thing be ready .

And how your National Assembly , like a ship waterlogged , helmless ,
lies tumbling ; the Galleries , of shrill Women , of Federes with sabres ,
bellowing down on it , not unfrightful ; -- and waits where the waves
of chance may please to strand it ; suspicious , nay on the Left side ,
conscious , what submarine Explosion is meanwhile a @-@ charging ! Petition
for King &apos;s Forfeiture rises often there : Petition from Paris Section ,
from Provincial Patriot Towns ; From Alencon , Briancon , and &apos; the Traders
at the Fair of Beaucaire . &apos; Or what of these ? On the 3rd of August ,
Mayor Petion and the Municipality come petitioning for Forfeiture :
they openly , in their tricolor Municipal scarfs . Forfeiture is what all
Patriots now want and expect . All Brissotins want Forfeiture ; with the
little Prince Royal for King , and us for Protector over him . Emphatic
Federes asks the legislature : &quot; Can you save us , or not ? &quot; Forty @-@ seven
Seconds have agreed to Forfeiture ; only that of the Filles @-@ Saint @-@ Thomas
pretending to disagree . Nay Section Mauconseil declares Forfeiture to
be , properly speaking , come ; Mauconseil for one &apos; does from this day , &apos;
the last of July , &apos; cease allegiance to Louis , &apos; and take minute of the
same before all men . A thing blamed aloud ; but which will be praised
aloud ; and the name Mauconseil , of Ill @-@ counsel , be thenceforth changed
to Bonconseil , of Good @-@ counsel .

President Danton , in the Cordeliers Section , does another thing : invites
all Passive Citizens to take place among the Active in Section @-@ business ,
one peril threatening all . Thus he , though an official person ; cloudy
Atlas of the whole . Likewise he manages to have that blackbrowed
Battalion of Marseillese shifted to new Barracks , in his own region of
the remote South @-@ East . Sleek Chaumette , cruel Billaud , Deputy Chabot
the Disfrocked , Huguenin with the tocsin in his heart , will welcome them
there . Wherefore , again and again : &quot; O Legislators , can you save us or
not ? &quot; Poor Legislators ; with their Legislature waterlogged , volcanic
Explosion charging under it ! Forfeiture shall be debated on the ninth
day of August ; that miserable business of Lafayette may be expected to
terminate on the eighth .

Or will the humane Reader glance into the Levee @-@ day of Sunday the fifth ?
The last Levee ! Not for a long time , &apos; never , &apos; says Bertrand @-@ Moleville ,
had a Levee been so brilliant , at least so crowded . A sad presaging
interest sat on every face ; Bertrand &apos;s own eyes were filled with tears .
For , indeed , outside of that Tricolor Riband on the Feuillants Terrace ,
Legislature is debating , Sections are defiling , all Paris is astir
this very Sunday , demanding Decheance . ( Hist . Parl. xvi . 337 @-@ 9 . )
Here , however , within the riband , a grand proposal is on foot , for
the hundredth time , of carrying his Majesty to Rouen and the Castle of
Gaillon . Swiss at Courbevoye are in readiness ; much is ready ; Majesty
himself seems almost ready . Nevertheless , for the hundredth time ,
Majesty , when near the point of action , draws back ; writes , after one
has waited , palpitating , an endless summer day , that &apos; he has reason
to believe the Insurrection is not so ripe as you suppose . &apos; Whereat
Bertrand @-@ Moleville breaks forth &apos; into extremity at one of spleen and
despair , d &apos;humeur et de desespoir . &apos; ( Bertrand @-@ Moleville , Memoires , ii .
129 . )



Chapter 2.6.VI.

The Steeples at Midnight .

For , in truth , the Insurrection is just about ripe . Thursday is the
ninth of the month August : if Forfeiture be not pronounced by the
Legislature that day , we must pronounce it ourselves .

Legislature ? A poor waterlogged Legislature can pronounce nothing . On
Wednesday the eighth , after endless oratory once again , they cannot
even pronounce Accusation again Lafayette ; but absolve him , -- hear
it , Patriotism ! -- by a majority of two to one . Patriotism hears it ;
Patriotism , hounded on by Prussian Terror , by Preternatural Suspicion ,
roars tumultuous round the Salle de Manege , all day ; insults many
leading Deputies , of the absolvent Right @-@ side ; nay chases them , collars
them with loud menace : Deputy Vaublanc , and others of the like , are glad
to take refuge in Guardhouses , and escape by the back window . And so ,
next day , there is infinite complaint ; Letter after Letter from insulted
Deputy ; mere complaint , debate and self @-@ cancelling jargon : the sun of
Thursday sets like the others , and no Forfeiture pronounced . Wherefore
in fine , To your tents , O Israel !

The Mother @-@ Society ceases speaking ; groups cease haranguing : Patriots ,
with closed lips now , &apos; take one another &apos;s arm ; &apos; walk off , in rows , two
and two , at a brisk business @-@ pace ; and vanish afar in the obscure places
of the East . ( Deux Amis , viii . 129 @-@ 88 . ) Santerre is ready ; or we will
make him ready . Forty @-@ seven of the Forty @-@ eight Sections are ready ; nay
Filles @-@ Saint @-@ Thomas itself turns up the Jacobin side of it , turns down
the Feuillant side of it , and is ready too . Let the unlimited Patriot
look to his weapon , be it pike , be it firelock ; and the Brest brethren ,
above all , the blackbrowed Marseillese prepare themselves for the
extreme hour ! Syndic Roederer knows , and laments or not as the issue may
turn , that &apos; five thousand ball @-@ cartridges , within these few days , have
been distributed to Federes , at the Hotel @-@ de @-@ Ville . &apos; ( Roederer a la
Barre , Seance du 9 Aout in Hist . Parl. xvi . 393 . )

And ye likewise , gallant gentlemen , defenders of Royalty , crowd ye on
your side to the Tuileries . Not to a Levee : no , to a Couchee : where much
will be put to bed . Your Tickets of Entry are needful ; needfuller your
blunderbusses ! -- They come and crowd , like gallant men who also know how
to die : old Maille the Camp @-@ Marshal has come , his eyes gleaming once
again , though dimmed by the rheum of almost four @-@ score years . Courage ,
Brothers ! We have a thousand red Swiss ; men stanch of heart , steadfast
as the granite of their Alps . National Grenadiers are at least friends
of Order ; Commandant Mandat breathes loyal ardour , will &quot; answer for it
on his head . &quot; Mandat will , and his Staff ; for the Staff , though there
stands a doom and Decree to that effect , is happily never yet dissolved .

Commandant Mandat has corresponded with Mayor Petion ; carries a written
Order from him these three days , to repel force by force . A squadron
on the Pont Neuf with cannon shall turn back these Marseillese coming
across the River : a squadron at the Townhall shall cut Saint @-@ Antoine in
two , &apos; as it issues from the Arcade Saint @-@ Jean ; &apos; drive one half back to
the obscure East , drive the other half forward through &apos; the Wickets of
the Louvre . &apos; Squadrons not a few , and mounted squadrons ; squadrons in
the Palais Royal , in the Place Vendome : all these shall charge , at the
right moment ; sweep this street , and then sweep that . Some new Twentieth
of June we shall have ; only still more ineffectual ? Or probably
the Insurrection will not dare to rise at all ? Mandat &apos;s Squadrons ,
Horse @-@ Gendarmerie and blue Guards march , clattering , tramping ; Mandat &apos;s
Cannoneers rumble . Under cloud of night ; to the sound of his generale ,
which begins drumming when men should go to bed . It is the 9th night of
August , 1792 .

On the other hand , the Forty @-@ eight Sections correspond by swift
messengers ; are choosing each their &apos; three Delegates with full powers . &apos; 
Syndic Roederer , Mayor Petion are sent for to the Tuileries : courageous
Legislators , when the drum beats danger , should repair to their
Salle . Demoiselle Theroigne has on her grenadier @-@ bonnet , short @-@ skirted
riding @-@ habit ; two pistols garnish her small waist , and sabre hangs in
baldric by her side .

Such a game is playing in this Paris Pandemonium , or City of All the
Devils ! -- And yet the Night , as Mayor Petion walks here in the Tuileries
Garden , &apos; is beautiful and calm ; &apos; Orion and the Pleiades glitter
down quite serene . Petion has come forth , the &apos; heat &apos; inside was so
oppressive . ( Roederer , Chronique de Cinquante Jours : Recit de Petion .
Townhall Records , &amp; c. in Hist . Parl. xvi . 399 @-@ 466 . ) Indeed , his
Majesty &apos;s reception of him was of the roughest ; as it well might be . And
now there is no outgate ; Mandat &apos;s blue Squadrons turn you back at every
Grate ; nay the Filles @-@ Saint @-@ Thomas Grenadiers give themselves liberties
of tongue , How a virtuous Mayor &apos; shall pay for it , if there be
mischief , &apos; and the like ; though others again are full of civility .
Surely if any man in France is in straights this night , it is Mayor
Petion : bound , under pain of death , one may say , to smile dexterously
with the one side of his face , and weep with the other ; -- death if he do
it not dexterously enough ! Not till four in the morning does a National
Assembly , hearing of his plight , summon him over &apos; to give account of
Paris ; &apos; of which he knows nothing : whereby however he shall get home to
bed , and only his gilt coach be left . Scarcely less delicate is Syndic
Roederer &apos;s task ; who must wait whether he will lament or not , till he
see the issue . Janus Bifrons , or Mr. Facing @-@ both @-@ ways , as vernacular
Bunyan has it ! They walk there , in the meanwhile , these two Januses ,
with others of the like double conformation ; and &apos; talk of indifferent
matters . &apos; 

Roederer , from time to time , steps in ; to listen , to speak ; to send for
the Department @-@ Directory itself , he their Procureur Syndic not seeing
how to act . The Apartments are all crowded ; some seven hundred gentlemen
in black elbowing , bustling ; red Swiss standing like rocks ; ghost , or
partial @-@ ghost of a Ministry , with Roederer and advisers , hovering round
their Majesties ; old Marshall Maille kneeling at the King &apos;s feet , to
say , He and these gallant gentlemen are come to die for him . List !
through the placid midnight ; clang of the distant stormbell ! So , in very
sooth ; steeple after steeple takes up the wondrous tale . Black Courtiers
listen at the windows , opened for air ; discriminate the steeple @-@ bells :
( Roederer , ubi supra . ) this is the tocsin of Saint @-@ Roch ; that again ,
is it not Saint @-@ Jacques , named de la Boucherie ? Yes , Messieurs ! Or even
Saint @-@ Germain l &apos;Auxerrois , hear ye it not ? The same metal that rang
storm , two hundred and twenty years ago ; but by a Majesty &apos;s order
then ; on Saint @-@ Bartholomew &apos;s Eve ( 24th August , 1572 . ) -- So go the
steeple @-@ bells ; which Courtiers can discriminate . Nay , meseems , there is
the Townhall itself ; we know it by its sound ! Yes , Friends , that is
the Townhall ; discoursing so , to the Night . Miraculously ; by miraculous
metal @-@ tongue and man &apos;s arm : Marat himself , if you knew it , is pulling at
the rope there ! Marat is pulling ; Robespierre lies deep , invisible for
the next forty hours ; and some men have heart , and some have as good as
none , and not even frenzy will give them any .

What struggling confusion , as the issue slowly draws on ; and the
doubtful Hour , with pain and blind struggle , brings forth its Certainty ,
never to be abolished ! -- The Full @-@ power Delegates , three from each
Section , a Hundred and forty @-@ four in all , got gathered at the Townhall ,
about midnight . Mandat &apos;s Squadron , stationed there , did not hinder their
entering : are they not the &apos; Central Committee of the Sections &apos; who sit
here usually ; though in greater number tonight ? They are there : presided
by Confusion , Irresolution , and the Clack of Tongues . Swift scouts
fly ; Rumour buzzes , of black Courtiers , red Swiss , of Mandat and his
Squadrons that shall charge . Better put off the Insurrection ? Yes , put
it off . Ha , hark ! Saint @-@ Antoine booming out eloquent tocsin , of its own
accord ! -- Friends , no : ye cannot put off the Insurrection ; but must put
it on , and live with it , or die with it .

Swift now , therefore : let these actual Old Municipals , on sight of the
Full @-@ powers , and mandate of the Sovereign elective People , lay down
their functions ; and this New Hundred and forty @-@ four take them up ! Will
ye nill ye , worthy Old Municipals , ye must go . Nay is it not a happiness
for many a Municipal that he can wash his hands of such a business ; and
sit there paralyzed , unaccountable , till the Hour do bring forth ; or
even go home to his night &apos;s rest ? ( Section Documents , Townhall Documents ,
Hist . Parl. ubi supra . ) Two only of the Old , or at most three , we
retain Mayor Petion , for the present walking in the Tuileries ; Procureur
Manuel ; Procureur Substitute Danton , invisible Atlas of the whole . And
so , with our Hundred and forty @-@ four , among whom are a Tocsin @-@ Huguenin ,
a Billaud , a Chaumette ; and Editor @-@ Talliens , and Fabre d &apos;Eglantines ,
Sergents , Panises ; and in brief , either emergent , or else emerged and
full @-@ blown , the entire Flower of unlimited Patriotism : have we not , as
by magic , made a New Municipality ; ready to act in the unlimited manner ;
and declare itself roundly , &apos; in a State of Insurrection ! &apos; -- First of all ,
then , be Commandant Mandat sent for , with that Mayor &apos;s @-@ Order of his ;
also let the New Municipals visit those Squadrons that were to charge ;
and let the stormbell ring its loudest ; -- and , on the whole , Forward , ye
Hundred and forty @-@ four ; retreat is now none for you !

Reader , fancy not , in thy languid way , that Insurrection is easy .
Insurrection is difficult : each individual uncertain even of his next
neighbour ; totally uncertain of his distant neighbours , what strength
is with him , what strength is against him ; certain only that , in case of
failure , his individual portion is the gallows ! Eight hundred thousand
heads , and in each of them a separate estimate of these uncertainties ,
a separate theorem of action conformable to that : out of so many
uncertainties , does the certainty , and inevitable net @-@ result never to
be abolished , go on , at all moments , bodying itself forth ; -- leading thee
also towards civic @-@ crowns or an ignominious noose .

Could the Reader take an Asmodeus &apos;s Flight , and waving open all roofs
and privacies , look down from the Tower of Notre Dame , what a Paris were
it ! Of treble @-@ voice whimperings or vehemence , of bass @-@ voice growlings ,
dubitations ; Courage screwing itself to desperate defiance ; Cowardice
trembling silent within barred doors ; -- and all round , Dulness calmly
snoring ; for much Dulness , flung on its mattresses , always sleeps . O ,
between the clangour of these high @-@ storming tocsins and that snore of
Dulness , what a gamut : of trepidation , excitation , desperation ; and
above it mere Doubt , Danger , Atropos and Nox !

Fighters of this section draw out ; hear that the next Section does
not ; and thereupon draw in . Saint @-@ Antoine , on this side the River , is
uncertain of Saint @-@ Marceau on that . Steady only is the snore of Dulness ,
are the Six Hundred Marseillese that know how to die ! Mandat , twice
summoned to the Townhall , has not come . Scouts fly incessant , in
distracted haste ; and the many @-@ whispering voices of Rumour . Theroigne
and unofficial Patriots flit , dim @-@ visible , exploratory , far and wide ;
like Night @-@ birds on the wing . Of Nationals some Three thousand have
followed Mandat and his generale ; the rest follow each his own theorem
of the uncertainties : theorem , that one should march rather with
Saint @-@ Antoine ; innumerable theorems , that in such a case the wholesomest
were sleep . And so the drums beat , in made fits , and the stormbells
peal . Saint @-@ Antoine itself does but draw out and draw in ; Commandant
Santerre , over there , cannot believe that the Marseillese and Saint
Marceau will march . Thou laggard sonorous Beer @-@ vat , with the loud voice
and timber head , is it time now to palter ? Alsatian Westermann clutches
him by the throat with drawn sabre : whereupon the Timber @-@ headed
believes . In this manner wanes the slow night ; amid fret , uncertainty
and tocsin ; all men &apos;s humour rising to the hysterical pitch ; and nothing
done .

However , Mandat , on the third summons does come ; -- come , unguarded ;
astonished to find the Municipality new . They question him straitly on
that Mayor &apos;s @-@ Order to resist force by force ; on that strategic scheme of
cutting Saint @-@ Antoine in two halves : he answers what he can : they think
it were right to send this strategic National Commandant to the Abbaye
Prison , and let a Court of Law decide on him . Alas , a Court of Law , not
Book @-@ Law but primeval Club @-@ Law , crowds and jostles out of doors ; all
fretted to the hysterical pitch ; cruel as Fear , blind as the Night : such
Court of Law , and no other , clutches poor Mandat from his constables ;
beats him down , massacres him , on the steps of the Townhall . Look to it ,
ye new Municipals ; ye People , in a state of Insurrection ! Blood is shed ,
blood must be answered for ; -- alas , in such hysterical humour , more blood
will flow : for it is as with the Tiger in that ; he has only to begin .

Seventeen Individuals have been seized in the Champs Elysees , by
exploratory Patriotism ; they flitting dim @-@ visible , by it flitting
dim @-@ visible . Ye have pistols , rapiers , ye Seventeen ? One of those
accursed &apos; false Patrols ; &apos; that go marauding , with Anti @-@ National intent ;
seeking what they can spy , what they can spill ! The Seventeen are
carried to the nearest Guard @-@ house ; eleven of them escape by back
passages . &quot; How is this ? &quot; Demoiselle Theroigne appears at the front
entrance , with sabre , pistols , and a train ; denounces treasonous
connivance ; demands , seizes , the remaining six , that the justice of the
People be not trifled with . Of which six two more escape in the whirl
and debate of the Club @-@ Law Court ; the last unhappy Four are massacred ,
as Mandat was : Two Ex @-@ Bodyguards ; one dissipated Abbe ; one Royalist
Pamphleteer , Sulleau , known to us by name , Able Editor , and wit of all
work . Poor Sulleau : his Acts of the Apostles , and brisk Placard @-@ Journals
( for he was an able man ) come to Finis , in this manner ; and questionable
jesting issues suddenly in horrid earnest ! Such doings usher in the dawn
of the Tenth of August , 1792 .

Or think what a night the poor National Assembly has had : sitting there ,
&apos;in great paucity , &apos; attempting to debate ; -- quivering and shivering ;
pointing towards all the thirty @-@ two azimuths at once , as the
magnet @-@ needle does when thunderstorm is in the air ! If the Insurrection
come ? If it come , and fail ? Alas , in that case , may not black Courtiers ,
with blunderbusses , red Swiss with bayonets rush over , flushed with
victory , and ask us : Thou undefinable , waterlogged , self @-@ distractive ,
self @-@ destructive Legislative , what dost thou here unsunk ? -- Or figure
the poor National Guards , bivouacking &apos; in temporary tents &apos; there ; or
standing ranked , shifting from leg to leg , all through the weary night ;
New tricolor Municipals ordering one thing , old Mandat Captains ordering
another ! Procureur Manuel has ordered the cannons to be withdrawn from
the Pont Neuf ; none ventured to disobey him . It seemed certain , then ,
the old Staff so long doomed has finally been dissolved , in these
hours ; and Mandat is not our Commandant now , but Santerre ? Yes , friends :
Santerre henceforth , -- surely Mandat no more ! The Squadrons that were to
charge see nothing certain , except that they are cold , hungry , worn down
with watching ; that it were sad to slay French brothers ; sadder to
be slain by them . Without the Tuileries Circuit , and within it , sour
uncertain humour sways these men : only the red Swiss stand steadfast .
Them their officers refresh now with a slight wetting of brandy ; wherein
the Nationals , too far gone for brandy , refuse to participate .

King Louis meanwhile had laid him down for a little sleep : his wig when
he reappeared had lost the powder on one side . ( Roederer , ubi supra . )
Old Marshal Maille and the gentlemen in black rise always in spirits ,
as the Insurrection does not rise : there goes a witty saying now , &quot; Le
tocsin ne rend pas . &quot; The tocsin , like a dry milk @-@ cow , does not yield .
For the rest , could one not proclaim Martial Law ? Not easily ; for
now , it seems , Mayor Petion is gone . On the other hand , our Interim
Commandant , poor Mandat being off , &apos; to the Hotel @-@ de @-@ Ville , &apos; complains
that so many Courtiers in black encumber the service , are an eyesorrow
to the National Guards . To which her Majesty answers with emphasis , That
they will obey all , will suffer all , that they are sure men these .

And so the yellow lamplight dies out in the gray of morning , in the
King &apos;s Palace , over such a scene . Scene of jostling , elbowing , of
confusion , and indeed conclusion , for the thing is about to end .
Roederer and spectral Ministers jostle in the press ; consult , in side
cabinets , with one or with both Majesties . Sister Elizabeth takes the
Queen to the window : &quot; Sister , see what a beautiful sunrise , &quot; right over
the Jacobins church and that quarter ! How happy if the tocsin did not
yield ! But Mandat returns not ; Petion is gone : much hangs wavering in
the invisible Balance . About five o &apos;clock , there rises from the Garden a
kind of sound ; as of a shout to which had become a howl , and instead
of Vive le Roi were ending in Vive la Nation . &quot; Mon Dieu ! &quot; ejaculates a
spectral Minister , &quot; what is he doing down there ? &quot; For it is his Majesty ,
gone down with old Marshal Maille to review the troops ; and the nearest
companies of them answer so . Her Majesty bursts into a stream of tears .
Yet on stepping from the cabinet her eyes are dry and calm , her look
is even cheerful . &apos; The Austrian lip , and the aquiline nose , fuller than
usual , gave to her countenance , &apos; says Peltier , ( in Toulongeon , ii . 241 . )
&apos;something of Majesty , which they that did not see her in these moments
cannot well have an idea of . &apos; O thou Theresa &apos;s Daughter !

King Louis enters , much blown with the fatigue ; but for the rest with
his old air of indifference . Of all hopes now surely the joyfullest
were , that the tocsin did not yield .



Chapter 2.6.VII.

The Swiss .

Unhappy Friends , the tocsin does yield , has yielded ! Lo ye , how with
the first sun @-@ rays its Ocean @-@ tide , of pikes and fusils , flows glittering
from the far East ; -- immeasurable ; born of the Night ! They march there ,
the grim host ; Saint @-@ Antoine on this side of the River ; Saint @-@ Marceau on
that , the blackbrowed Marseillese in the van . With hum , and grim murmur ,
far @-@ heard ; like the Ocean @-@ tide , as we say : drawn up , as if by Luna and
Influences , from the great Deep of Waters , they roll gleaming on ;
no King , Canute or Louis , can bid them roll back . Wide @-@ eddying
side @-@ currents , of onlookers , roll hither and thither , unarmed , not
voiceless ; they , the steel host , roll on . New @-@ Commandant Santerre ,
indeed , has taken seat at the Townhall ; rests there , in his
half @-@ way @-@ house . Alsatian Westermann , with flashing sabre , does not rest ;
nor the Sections , nor the Marseillese , nor Demoiselle Theroigne ; but
roll continually on .

And now , where are Mandat &apos;s Squadrons that were to charge ? Not a
Squadron of them stirs : or they stir in the wrong direction , out of the
way ; their officers glad that they will even do that . It is to this
hour uncertain whether the Squadron on the Pont Neuf made the shadow
of resistance , or did not make the shadow : enough , the blackbrowed
Marseillese , and Saint @-@ Marceau following them , do cross without let ;
do cross , in sure hope now of Saint @-@ Antoine and the rest ; do billow on ,
towards the Tuileries , where their errand is . The Tuileries , at sound of
them , rustles responsive : the red Swiss look to their priming ; Courtiers
in black draw their blunderbusses , rapiers , poniards , some have even
fire @-@ shovels ; every man his weapon of war .

Judge if , in these circumstances , Syndic Roederer felt easy ! Will the
kind Heavens open no middle @-@ course of refuge for a poor Syndic who
halts between two ? If indeed his Majesty would consent to go over to the
Assembly ! His Majesty , above all her Majesty , cannot agree to that . Did
her Majesty answer the proposal with a &quot; Fi donc ; &quot; did she say even , she
would be nailed to the walls sooner ? Apparently not . It is written also
that she offered the King a pistol ; saying , Now or else never was the
time to shew himself . Close eye @-@ witnesses did not see it , nor do we .
That saw only that she was queenlike , quiet ; that she argued not ,
upbraided not , with the Inexorable ; but , like Caesar in the Capitol ,
wrapped her mantle , as it beseems Queens and Sons of Adam to do . But
thou , O Louis ! of what stuff art thou at all ? Is there no stroke in
thee , then , for Life and Crown ? The silliest hunted deer dies not so .
Art thou the languidest of all mortals ; or the mildest @-@ minded ? Thou art
the worst @-@ starred .

The tide advances ; Syndic Roederer &apos;s and all men &apos;s straits grow straiter
and straiter . Fremescent clangor comes from the armed Nationals in the
Court ; far and wide is the infinite hubbub of tongues . What counsel ? And
the tide is now nigh ! Messengers , forerunners speak hastily through the
outer Grates ; hold parley sitting astride the walls . Syndic Roederer
goes out and comes in . Cannoneers ask him : Are we to fire against the
people ? King &apos;s Ministers ask him : Shall the King &apos;s House be forced ?
Syndic Roederer has a hard game to play . He speaks to the Cannoneers
with eloquence , with fervour ; such fervour as a man can , who has to blow
hot and cold in one breath . Hot and cold , O Roederer ? We , for our part ,
cannot live and die ! The Cannoneers , by way of answer , fling down their
linstocks . -- Think of this answer , O King Louis , and King &apos;s Ministers :
and take a poor Syndic &apos;s safe middle @-@ course , towards the Salle de
Manege . King Louis sits , his hands leant on knees , body bent forward ;
gazes for a space fixedly on Syndic Roederer ; then answers , looking
over his shoulder to the Queen : Marchons ! They march ; King Louis , Queen ,
Sister Elizabeth , the two royal children and governess : these , with
Syndic Roederer , and Officials of the Department ; amid a double rank of
National Guards . The men with blunderbusses , the steady red Swiss
gaze mournfully , reproachfully ; but hear only these words from Syndic
Roederer : &quot; The King is going to the Assembly ; make way . &quot; It has
struck eight , on all clocks , some minutes ago : the King has left the
Tuileries -- for ever .

O ye stanch Swiss , ye gallant gentlemen in black , for what a cause are
ye to spend and be spent ! Look out from the western windows , ye may
see King Louis placidly hold on his way ; the poor little Prince Royal
&apos;sportfully kicking the fallen leaves . &apos; Fremescent multitude on the
Terrace of the Feuillants whirls parallel to him ; one man in it , very
noisy , with a long pole : will they not obstruct the outer Staircase , and
back @-@ entrance of the Salle , when it comes to that ? King &apos;s Guards can
go no further than the bottom step there . Lo , Deputation of Legislators
come out ; he of the long pole is stilled by oratory ; Assembly &apos;s Guards
join themselves to King &apos;s Guards , and all may mount in this case of
necessity ; the outer Staircase is free , or passable . See , Royalty
ascends ; a blue Grenadier lifts the poor little Prince Royal from the
press ; Royalty has entered in . Royalty has vanished for ever from
your eyes . -- And ye ? Left standing there , amid the yawning abysses ,
and earthquake of Insurrection ; without course ; without command : if ye
perish it must be as more than martyrs , as martyrs who are now without a
cause ! The black Courtiers disappear mostly ; through such issues as they
can . The poor Swiss know not how to act : one duty only is clear to them ,
that of standing by their post ; and they will perform that .

But the glittering steel tide has arrived ; it beats now against the
Chateau barriers , and eastern Courts ; irresistible , loud @-@ surging far
and wide ; -- breaks in , fills the Court of the Carrousel , blackbrowed
Marseillese in the van . King Louis gone , say you ; over to the Assembly !
Well and good : but till the Assembly pronounce Forfeiture of him , what
boots it ? Our post is in that Chateau or stronghold of his ; there till
then must we continue . Think , ye stanch Swiss , whether it were good
that grim murder began , and brothers blasted one another in pieces for a
stone edifice ? -- Poor Swiss ! they know not how to act : from the southern
windows , some fling cartridges , in sign of brotherhood ; on the eastern
outer staircase , and within through long stairs and corridors , they
stand firm @-@ ranked , peaceable and yet refusing to stir . Westermann speaks
to them in Alsatian German ; Marseillese plead , in hot Provencal speech
and pantomime ; stunning hubbub pleads and threatens , infinite , around .
The Swiss stand fast , peaceable and yet immovable ; red granite pier in
that waste @-@ flashing sea of steel .

Who can help the inevitable issue ; Marseillese and all France , on this
side ; granite Swiss on that ? The pantomime grows hotter and hotter ;
Marseillese sabres flourishing by way of action ; the Swiss brow also
clouding itself , the Swiss thumb bringing its firelock to the cock . And
hark ! high @-@ thundering above all the din , three Marseillese cannon from
the Carrousel , pointed by a gunner of bad aim , come rattling over the
roofs ! Ye Swiss , therefore : Fire ! The Swiss fire ; by volley , by platoon ,
in rolling @-@ fire : Marseillese men not a few , and &apos; a tall man that was
louder than any , &apos; lie silent , smashed , upon the pavement ; -- not a few
Marseillese , after the long dusty march , have made halt here . The
Carrousel is void ; the black tide recoiling ; &apos; fugitives rushing as far
as Saint @-@ Antoine before they stop . &apos; The Cannoneers without linstock have
squatted invisible , and left their cannon ; which the Swiss seize .

Think what a volley : reverberating doomful to the four corners of
Paris , and through all hearts ; like the clang of Bellona &apos;s thongs ! The
blackbrowed Marseillese , rallying on the instant , have become black
Demons that know how to die . Nor is Brest behind @-@ hand ; nor Alsatian
Westermann ; Demoiselle Theroigne is Sybil Theroigne : Vengeance
Victoire , ou la mort ! From all Patriot artillery , great and small ;
from Feuillants Terrace , and all terraces and places of the widespread
Insurrectionary sea , there roars responsive a red whirlwind . Blue
Nationals , ranked in the Garden , cannot help their muskets going off ,
against Foreign murderers . For there is a sympathy in muskets , in heaped
masses of men : nay , are not Mankind , in whole , like tuned strings , and
a cunning infinite concordance and unity ; you smite one string , and
all strings will begin sounding , -- in soft sphere @-@ melody , in deafening
screech of madness ! Mounted Gendarmerie gallop distracted ; are fired on
merely as a thing running ; galloping over the Pont Royal , or one knows
not whither . The brain of Paris , brain @-@ fevered in the centre of it here ,
has gone mad ; what you call , taken fire .

Behold , the fire slackens not ; nor does the Swiss rolling @-@ fire slacken
from within . Nay they clutched cannon , as we saw : and now , from
the other side , they clutch three pieces more ; alas , cannon without
linstock ; nor will the steel @-@ and @-@ flint answer , though they try it . ( Deux
Amis , viii . 179 @-@ 88 . ) Had it chanced to answer ! Patriot onlookers have
their misgivings ; one strangest Patriot onlooker thinks that the Swiss ,
had they a commander , would beat . He is a man not unqualified to judge ;
the name of him is Napoleon Buonaparte . ( See Hist . Parl . ( xvii . 56 ) ; Las
Cases , &amp; c . ) And onlookers , and women , stand gazing , and the witty Dr.
Moore of Glasgow among them , on the other side of the River : cannon
rush rumbling past them ; pause on the Pont Royal ; belch out their iron
entrails there , against the Tuileries ; and at every new belch , the women
and onlookers shout and clap hands . ( Moore , Journal during a Residence
in France ( Dublin , 1793 ) , i . 26 . ) City of all the Devils ! In remote
streets , men are drinking breakfast @-@ coffee ; following their affairs ;
with a start now and then , as some dull echo reverberates a note
louder . And here ? Marseillese fall wounded ; but Barbaroux has surgeons ;
Barbaroux is close by , managing , though underhand , and under cover .
Marseillese fall death @-@ struck ; bequeath their firelock , specify in which
pocket are the cartridges ; and die , murmuring , &quot; Revenge me , Revenge thy
country ! &quot; Brest Federe Officers , galloping in red coats , are shot as
Swiss . Lo you , the Carrousel has burst into flame ! -- Paris Pandemonium !
Nay the poor City , as we said , is in fever @-@ fit and convulsion ; such
crisis has lasted for the space of some half hour .

But what is this that , with Legislative Insignia , ventures through the
hubbub and death @-@ hail , from the back @-@ entrance of the Manege ? Towards the
Tuileries and Swiss : written Order from his Majesty to cease firing ! O
ye hapless Swiss , why was there no order not to begin it ? Gladly would
the Swiss cease firing : but who will bid mad Insurrection cease firing ?
To Insurrection you cannot speak ; neither can it , hydra @-@ headed , hear .
The dead and dying , by the hundred , lie all around ; are borne bleeding
through the streets , towards help ; the sight of them , like a torch of
the Furies , kindling Madness . Patriot Paris roars ; as the bear bereaved
of her whelps . On , ye Patriots : vengeance ! victory or death ! There are
men seen , who rush on , armed only with walking @-@ sticks . ( Hist . Parl. ubi
supra . Rapport du Captaine des Canonniers , Rapport du Commandant , &amp; c .
Ibid. xvii . 300 @-@ 18 . ) Terror and Fury rule the hour .

The Swiss , pressed on from without , paralyzed from within , have ceased
to shoot ; but not to be shot . What shall they do ? Desperate is the
moment . Shelter or instant death : yet How ? Where ? One party flies out
by the Rue de l &apos;Echelle ; is destroyed utterly , &apos; en entier . &apos; A second , by
the other side , throws itself into the Garden ; &apos; hurrying across a keen
fusillade : &apos; rushes suppliant into the National Assembly ; finds pity and
refuge in the back benches there . The third , and largest , darts out in
column , three hundred strong , towards the Champs Elysees : Ah , could we
but reach Courbevoye , where other Swiss are ! Wo ! see , in such fusillade
the column &apos; soon breaks itself by diversity of opinion , &apos; into distracted
segments , this way and that ; -- to escape in holes , to die fighting from
street to street . The firing and murdering will not cease ; not yet for
long . The red Porters of Hotels are shot at , be they Suisse by nature ,
or Suisse only in name . The very Firemen , who pump and labour on that
smoking Carrousel , are shot at ; why should the Carrousel not burn ? Some
Swiss take refuge in private houses ; find that mercy too does still
dwell in the heart of man . The brave Marseillese are merciful , late so
wroth ; and labour to save . Journalist Gorsas pleads hard with enfuriated
groups . Clemence , the Wine @-@ merchant , stumbles forward to the Bar of the
Assembly , a rescued Swiss in his hand ; tells passionately how he rescued
him with pain and peril , how he will henceforth support him , being
childless himself ; and falls a swoon round the poor Swiss &apos;s neck : amid
plaudits . But the most are butchered , and even mangled . Fifty ( some
say Fourscore ) were marched as prisoners , by National Guards , to the
Hotel @-@ de @-@ Ville : the ferocious people bursts through on them , in the
Place de Greve ; massacres them to the last man . &apos; O Peuple , envy of the
universe ! &apos; Peuple , in mad Gaelic effervescence !

Surely few things in the history of carnage are painfuller . What
ineffaceable red streak , flickering so sad in the memory , is that ,
of this poor column of red Swiss &apos; breaking itself in the confusion of
opinions ; &apos; dispersing , into blackness and death ! Honour to you , brave
men ; honourable pity , through long times ! Not martyrs were ye ; and yet
almost more . He was no King of yours , this Louis ; and he forsook you
like a King of shreds and patches ; ye were but sold to him for some poor
sixpence a @-@ day ; yet would ye work for your wages , keep your plighted
word . The work now was to die ; and ye did it . Honour to you , O Kinsmen ;
and may the old Deutsch Biederheit and Tapferkeit , and Valour which
is Worth and Truth be they Swiss , be they Saxon , fail in no age ! Not
bastards ; true @-@ born were these men ; sons of the men of Sempach , of
Murten , who knelt , but not to thee , O Burgundy ! -- Let the traveller ,
as he passes through Lucerne , turn aside to look a little at their
monumental Lion ; not for Thorwaldsen &apos;s sake alone . Hewn out of living
rock , the Figure rests there , by the still Lake @-@ waters , in lullaby of
distant @-@ tinkling rance @-@ des @-@ vaches , the granite Mountains dumbly keeping
watch all round ; and , though inanimate , speaks .



Chapter 2.6.VIII.

Constitution burst in Pieces .

Thus is the Tenth of August won and lost . Patriotism reckons its
slain by thousand on thousand , so deadly was the Swiss fire from these
windows ; but will finally reduce them to some Twelve hundred . No child &apos;s
play was it ; -- nor is it ! Till two in the afternoon the massacring , the
breaking and the burning has not ended ; nor the loose Bedlam shut itself
again .

How deluges of frantic Sansculottism roared through all passages of this
Tuileries , ruthless in vengeance , how the Valets were butchered , hewn
down ; and Dame Campan saw the Marseilles sabre flash over her head , but
the Blackbrowed said , &quot; Va @-@ t @-@ en , Get thee gone , &quot; and flung her from him
unstruck : ( Campan , ii. c . 21 . ) how in the cellars wine @-@ bottles were
broken , wine @-@ butts were staved in and drunk ; and , upwards to the very
garrets , all windows tumbled out their precious royal furnitures ; and ,
with gold mirrors , velvet curtains , down of ript feather @-@ beds , and dead
bodies of men , the Tuileries was like no Garden of the Earth : -- all
this let him who has a taste for it see amply in Mercier , in acrid
Montgaillard , or Beaulieu of the Deux Amis . A hundred and eighty
bodies of Swiss lie piled there ; naked , unremoved till the second day .
Patriotism has torn their red coats into snips ; and marches with them at
the Pike &apos;s point : the ghastly bare corpses lie there , under the sun and
under the stars ; the curious of both sexes crowding to look . Which
let not us do . Above a hundred carts heaped with Dead fare towards the
Cemetery of Sainte @-@ Madeleine ; bewailed , bewept ; for all had kindred , all
had mothers , if not here , then there . It is one of those Carnage @-@ fields ,
such as you read of by the name &apos; Glorious Victory , &apos; brought home in this
case to one &apos;s own door .

But the blackbrowed Marseillese have struck down the Tyrant of the
Chateau . He is struck down ; low , and hardly to rise . What a moment
for an august Legislative was that when the Hereditary Representative
entered , under such circumstances ; and the Grenadier , carrying
the little Prince Royal out of the Press , set him down on the
Assembly @-@ table ! A moment , -- which one had to smooth off with oratory ;
waiting what the next would bring ! Louis said few words : &quot; He was come
hither to prevent a great crime ; he believed himself safer nowhere than
here . &quot; President Vergniaud answered briefly , in vague oratory as we say ,
about &quot; defence of Constituted Authorities , &quot; about dying at our post .
( Moniteur , Seance du 10 Aout 1792 . ) And so King Louis sat him down ;
first here , then there ; for a difficulty arose , the Constitution not
permitting us to debate while the King is present : finally he settles
himself with his Family in the &apos; Loge of the Logographe &apos; in the
Reporter &apos;s @-@ Box of a Journalist : which is beyond the enchanted
Constitutional Circuit , separated from it by a rail . To such Lodge of
the Logographe , measuring some ten feet square , with a small closet at
the entrance of it behind , is the King of broad France now limited : here
can he and his sit pent , under the eyes of the world , or retire into
their closet at intervals ; for the space of sixteen hours . Such quiet
peculiar moment has the Legislative lived to see .

But also what a moment was that other , few minutes later , when the three
Marseillese cannon went off , and the Swiss rolling @-@ fire and universal
thunder , like the Crack of Doom , began to rattle ! Honourable Members
start to their feet ; stray bullets singing epicedium even here ,
shivering in with window @-@ glass and jingle . &quot; No , this is our post ; let us
die here ! &quot; They sit therefore , like stone Legislators . But may not the
Lodge of the Logographe be forced from behind ? Tear down the railing
that divides it from the enchanted Constitutional Circuit ! Ushers tear
and tug ; his Majesty himself aiding from within : the railing gives way ;
Majesty and Legislative are united in place , unknown Destiny hovering
over both .

Rattle , and again rattle , went the thunder ; one breathless wide @-@ eyed
messenger rushing in after another : King &apos;s orders to the Swiss went
out . It was a fearful thunder ; but , as we know , it ended . Breathless
messengers , fugitive Swiss , denunciatory Patriots , trepidation ; finally
tripudiation ! -- Before four o &apos;clock much has come and gone .

The New Municipals have come and gone ; with Three Flags , Liberte ,
Egalite , Patrie , and the clang of vivats . Vergniaud , he who as President
few hours ago talked of Dying for Constituted Authorities , has moved ,
as Committee @-@ Reporter , that the Hereditary Representative be suspended ;
that a NATIONAL CONVENTION do forthwith assemble to say what further !
An able Report : which the President must have had ready in his pocket ?
A President , in such cases , must have much ready , and yet not ready ; and
Janus @-@ like look before and after .

King Louis listens to all ; retires about midnight &apos; to three little rooms
on the upper floor ; &apos; till the Luxembourg be prepared for him , and &apos; the
safeguard of the Nation . &apos; Safer if Brunswick were once here ! Or , alas ,
not so safe ? Ye hapless discrowned heads ! Crowds came , next morning , to
catch a climpse of them , in their three upper rooms . Montgaillard says
the august Captives wore an air of cheerfulness , even of gaiety ; that
the Queen and Princess Lamballe , who had joined her over night , looked
out of the open window , &apos; shook powder from their hair on the people
below , and laughed . &apos; ( Montgaillard. ii . 135 @-@ 167 . ) He is an acrid
distorted man .

For the rest , one may guess that the Legislative , above all that the New
Municipality continues busy . Messengers , Municipal or Legislative , and
swift despatches rush off to all corners of France ; full of triumph ,
blended with indignant wail , for Twelve hundred have fallen . France
sends up its blended shout responsive ; the Tenth of August shall be
as the Fourteenth of July , only bloodier and greater . The Court has
conspired ? Poor Court : the Court has been vanquished ; and will have both
the scath to bear and the scorn . How the Statues of Kings do now all
fall ! Bronze Henri himself , though he wore a cockade once , jingles down
from the Pont Neuf , where Patrie floats in Danger . Much more does Louis
Fourteenth , from the Place Vendome , jingle down , and even breaks in
falling . The curious can remark , written on his horse &apos;s shoe : &apos; 12 Aout
1692 ; &apos; a Century and a Day .

The Tenth of August was Friday . The week is not done , when our old
Patriot Ministry is recalled , what of it can be got : strict Roland ,
Genevese Claviere ; add heavy Monge the Mathematician , once a
stone @-@ hewer ; and , for Minister of Justice , -- Danton &apos; led hither , &apos; as
himself says , in one of his gigantic figures , &apos; through the breach of
Patriot cannon ! &apos; These , under Legislative Committees , must rule
the wreck as they can : confusedly enough ; with an old Legislative
waterlogged , with a New Municipality so brisk . But National Convention
will get itself together ; and then ! Without delay , however , let a New
Jury @-@ Court and Criminal Tribunal be set up in Paris , to try the crimes
and conspiracies of the Tenth . High Court of Orleans is distant , slow :
the blood of the Twelve hundred Patriots , whatever become of other
blood , shall be inquired after . Tremble , ye Criminals and Conspirators ;
the Minister of Justice is Danton ! Robespierre too , after the victory ,
sits in the New Municipality ; insurrectionary &apos; improvised Municipality , &apos;
which calls itself Council General of the Commune .

For three days now , Louis and his Family have heard the Legislative
Debates in the Lodge of the Logographe ; and retired nightly to their
small upper rooms . The Luxembourg and safeguard of the Nation could
not be got ready : nay , it seems the Luxembourg has too many cellars and
issues ; no Municipality can undertake to watch it . The compact Prison
of the Temple , not so elegant indeed , were much safer . To the Temple ,
therefore ! On Monday , 13th day of August 1792 , in Mayor Petion &apos;s
carriage , Louis and his sad suspended Household , fare thither ; all
Paris out to look at them . As they pass through the Place Vendome Louis
Fourteenth &apos;s Statue lies broken on the ground . Petion is afraid the
Queen &apos;s looks may be thought scornful , and produce provocation ;
she casts down her eyes , and does not look at all . The &apos; press is
prodigious , &apos; but quiet : here and there , it shouts Vive la Nation ; but
for most part gazes in silence . French Royalty vanishes within the gates
of the Temple : these old peaked Towers , like peaked Extinguisher or
Bonsoir , do cover it up ; -- from which same Towers , poor Jacques Molay and
his Templars were burnt out , by French Royalty , five centuries since .
Such are the turns of Fate below . Foreign Ambassadors , English Lord
Gower have all demanded passports ; are driving indignantly towards their
respective homes .

So , then , the Constitution is over ? For ever and a day ! Gone is that
wonder of the Universe ; First biennial Parliament , waterlogged , waits
only till the Convention come ; and will then sink to endless depths .

One can guess the silent rage of Old @-@ Constituents ,
Constitution @-@ builders , extinct Feuillants , men who thought the
Constitution would march ! Lafayette rises to the altitude of the
situation ; at the head of his Army . Legislative Commissioners are
posting towards him and it , on the Northern Frontier , to congratulate
and perorate : he orders the Municipality of Sedan to arrest these
Commissioners , and keep them strictly in ward as Rebels , till he say
further . The Sedan Municipals obey .

The Sedan Municipals obey : but the Soldiers of the Lafayette Army ? The
Soldiers of the Lafayette Army have , as all Soldiers have , a kind of dim
feeling that they themselves are Sansculottes in buff belts ; that the
victory of the Tenth of August is also a victory for them . They will not
rise and follow Lafayette to Paris ; they will rise and send him thither !
On the 18th , which is but next Saturday , Lafayette , with some two or
three indignant Staff @-@ officers , one of whom is Old @-@ Constituent Alexandre
de Lameth , having first put his Lines in what order he could , -- rides
swiftly over the Marches , towards Holland . Rides , alas , swiftly into
the claws of Austrians ! He , long @-@ wavering , trembling on the verge of the
horizon , has set , in Olmutz Dungeons ; this History knows him no more .
Adieu , thou Hero of two worlds ; thinnest , but compact honour @-@ worthy man !
Through long rough night of captivity , through other tumults , triumphs
and changes , thou wilt swing well , &apos; fast @-@ anchored to the Washington
Formula ; &apos; and be the Hero and Perfect @-@ character , were it only of one
idea . The Sedan Municipals repent and protest ; the Soldiers shout Vive
la Nation . Dumouriez Polymetis , from his Camp at Maulde , sees himself
made Commander in Chief .

And , O Brunswick ! what sort of &apos; military execution &apos; will Paris
merit now ? Forward , ye well @-@ drilled exterminatory men ; with your
artillery @-@ waggons , and camp kettles jingling . Forward , tall chivalrous
King of Prussia ; fanfaronading Emigrants and war @-@ god Broglie , &apos; for some
consolation to mankind , &apos; which verily is not without need of some .

Chapter 3.1.I.

The Improvised Commune .

Ye have roused her , then , ye Emigrants and Despots of the world ; France
is roused ; long have ye been lecturing and tutoring this poor Nation ,
like cruel uncalled @-@ for pedagogues , shaking over her your ferulas
of fire and steel : it is long that ye have pricked and fillipped and
affrighted her , there as she sat helpless in her dead cerements of
a Constitution , you gathering in on her from all lands , with your
armaments and plots , your invadings and truculent bullyings ; -- and lo
now , ye have pricked her to the quick , and she is up , and her blood is
up . The dead cerements are rent into cobwebs , and she fronts you in that
terrible strength of Nature , which no man has measured , which goes down
to Madness and Tophet : see now how ye will deal with her !

This month of September , 1792 , which has become one of the memorable
months of History , presents itself under two most diverse aspects ; all
of black on the one side , all of bright on the other . Whatsoever is
cruel in the panic frenzy of Twenty @-@ five million men , whatsoever is
great in the simultaneous death @-@ defiance of Twenty @-@ five million men ,
stand here in abrupt contrast , near by one another . As indeed is usual
when a man , how much more when a Nation of men , is hurled suddenly
beyond the limits . For Nature , as green as she looks , rests everywhere
on dread foundations , were we farther down ; and Pan , to whose music the
Nymphs dance , has a cry in him that can drive all men distracted .

Very frightful it is when a Nation , rending asunder its Constitutions
and Regulations which were grown dead cerements for it , becomes
transcendental ; and must now seek its wild way through the New ,
Chaotic , -- where Force is not yet distinguished into Bidden and
Forbidden , but Crime and Virtue welter unseparated , -- in that domain
of what is called the Passions ; of what we call the Miracles and the
Portents ! It is thus that , for some three years to come , we are
to contemplate France , in this final Third Volume of our History .
Sansculottism reigning in all its grandeur and in all its hideousness :
the Gospel ( God &apos;s Message ) of Man &apos;s Rights , Man &apos;s mights or strengths ,
once more preached irrefragably abroad ; along with this , and still
louder for the time , and fearfullest Devil &apos;s @-@ Message of Man &apos;s weaknesses
and sins ; -- and all on such a scale , and under such aspect : cloudy
&apos;death @-@ birth of a world ; &apos; huge smoke @-@ cloud , streaked with rays as of
heaven on one side ; girt on the other as with hell @-@ fire ! History tells
us many things : but for the last thousand years and more , what thing has
she told us of a sort like this ? Which therefore let us two , O Reader ,
dwell on willingly , for a little ; and from its endless significance
endeavour to extract what may , in present circumstances , be adapted for
us .

It is unfortunate , though very natural , that the history of this Period
has so generally been written in hysterics . Exaggeration abounds ,
execration , wailing ; and , on the whole , darkness . But thus too , when
foul old Rome had to be swept from the Earth , and those Northmen , and
other horrid sons of Nature , came in , &apos; swallowing formulas &apos; as the
French now do , foul old Rome screamed execratively her loudest ; so that ,
the true shape of many things is lost for us . Attila &apos;s Huns had arms of
such length that they could lift a stone without stooping . Into the body
of the poor Tatars execrative Roman History intercalated an alphabetic
letter ; and so they continue Ta @-@ r @-@ tars , of fell Tartarean nature , to
this day . Here , in like manner , search as we will in these multi @-@ form
innumerable French Records , darkness too frequently covers , or sheer
distraction bewilders . One finds it difficult to imagine that the Sun
shone in this September month , as he does in others . Nevertheless it is
an indisputable fact that the Sun did shine ; and there was weather and
work , -- nay , as to that , very bad weather for harvest work ! An unlucky
Editor may do his utmost ; and after all , require allowances .

He had been a wise Frenchman , who , looking , close at hand , on this waste
aspect of a France all stirring and whirling , in ways new , untried , had
been able to discern where the cardinal movement lay ; which tendency
it was that had the rule and primary direction of it then ! But at
forty @-@ four years &apos; distance , it is different . To all men now , two
cardinal movements or grand tendencies , in the September whirl ,
have become discernible enough : that stormful effluence towards the
Frontiers ; that frantic crowding towards Townhouses and Council @-@ halls in
the interior . Wild France dashes , in desperate death @-@ defiance , towards
the Frontiers , to defend itself from foreign Despots ; crowds towards
Townhalls and Election Committee @-@ rooms , to defend itself from domestic
Aristocrats . Let the Reader conceive well these two cardinal movements ;
and what side @-@ currents and endless vortexes might depend on these .
He shall judge too , whether , in such sudden wreckage of all old
Authorities , such a pair of cardinal movements , half @-@ frantic in
themselves , could be of soft nature ? As in dry Sahara , when the winds
waken , and lift and winnow the immensity of sand ! The air itself
( Travellers say ) is a dim sand @-@ air ; and dim looming through it , the
wonderfullest uncertain colonnades of Sand @-@ Pillars rush whirling from
this side and from that , like so many mad Spinning @-@ Dervishes , of a
hundred feet in stature ; and dance their huge Desert @-@ waltz there ! --

Nevertheless in all human movements , were they but a day old , there
is order , or the beginning of order . Consider two things in this
Sahara @-@ waltz of the French Twenty @-@ five millions ; or rather one thing ,
and one hope of a thing : the Commune ( Municipality ) of Paris , which is
already here ; the National Convention , which shall in few weeks be here .
The Insurrectionary Commune , which improvising itself on the eve of the
Tenth of August , worked this ever @-@ memorable Deliverance by explosion ,
must needs rule over it , -- till the Convention meet . This Commune , which
they may well call a spontaneous or &apos; improvised &apos; Commune , is , for the
present , sovereign of France . The Legislative , deriving its authority
from the Old , how can it now have authority when the Old is exploded by
insurrection ? As a floating piece of wreck , certain things , persons
and interests may still cleave to it : volunteer defenders , riflemen
or pikemen in green uniform , or red nightcap ( of bonnet rouge ) ,
defile before it daily , just on the wing towards Brunswick ; with the
brandishing of arms ; always with some touch of Leonidas @-@ eloquence , often
with a fire of daring that threatens to outherod Herod , -- the Galleries ,
&apos;especially the Ladies , never done with applauding . &apos; ( Moore &apos;s Journal ,
i . 85 . ) Addresses of this or the like sort can be received and answered ,
in the hearing of all France : the Salle de Manege is still useful as
a place of proclamation . For which use , indeed , it now chiefly serves .
Vergniaud delivers spirit @-@ stirring orations ; but always with a prophetic
sense only , looking towards the coming Convention . &quot; Let our memory
perish , &quot; cries Vergniaud , &quot; but let France be free ! &quot; -- whereupon they
all start to their feet , shouting responsive : &quot; Yes , yes , perisse notre
memoire , pourvu que la France soit libre ! &quot; ( Hist . Parl. xvii . 467 . )
Disfrocked Chabot abjures Heaven that at least we may &quot; have done with
Kings ; &quot; and fast as powder under spark , we all blaze up once more , and
with waved hats shout and swear : &quot; Yes , nous le jurons ; plus de roi ! &quot;
( Ibid. xvii . 437 . ) All which , as a method of proclamation , is very
convenient .

For the rest , that our busy Brissots , rigorous Rolands , men who once had
authority and now have less and less ; men who love law , and will have
even an Explosion explode itself , as far as possible , according to rule ,
do find this state of matters most unofficial unsatisfactory , -- is not to
be denied . Complaints are made ; attempts are made : but without effect .
The attempts even recoil ; and must be desisted from , for fear of worse :
the sceptre is departed from this Legislative once and always . A poor
Legislative , so hard was fate , had let itself be hand @-@ gyved , nailed to
the rock like an Andromeda , and could only wail there to the Earth
and Heavens ; miraculously a winged Perseus ( or Improvised Commune ) has
dawned out of the void Blue , and cut her loose : but whether now is
it she , with her softness and musical speech , or is it he , with his
hardness and sharp falchion and aegis , that shall have casting vote ?
Melodious agreement of vote ; this were the rule ! But if otherwise , and
votes diverge , then surely Andromeda &apos;s part is to weep , -- if possible ,
tears of gratitude alone .

Be content , O France , with this Improvised Commune , such as it is ! It
has the implements , and has the hands : the time is not long . On Sunday
the twenty @-@ sixth of August , our Primary Assemblies shall meet , begin
electing of Electors ; on Sunday the second of September ( may the day
prove lucky ! ) the Electors shall begin electing Deputies ; and so an
all @-@ healing National Convention will come together . No marc d &apos;argent , or
distinction of Active and Passive , now insults the French Patriot :
but there is universal suffrage , unlimited liberty to choose .
Old @-@ constituents , Present @-@ Legislators , all France is eligible . Nay , it
may be said , the flower of all the Universe ( de l &apos;Univers ) is eligible ;
for in these very days we , by act of Assembly , &apos; naturalise &apos; the chief
Foreign Friends of humanity : Priestley , burnt out for us in Birmingham ;
Klopstock , a genius of all countries ; Jeremy Bentham , useful
Jurisconsult ; distinguished Paine , the rebellious Needleman ; -- some of
whom may be chosen . As is most fit ; for a Convention of this kind . In a
word , Seven Hundred and Forty @-@ five unshackled sovereigns , admired of the
universe , shall replace this hapless impotency of a Legislative , -- out of
which , it is likely , the best members , and the Mountain in mass , may
be re @-@ elected . Roland is getting ready the Salles des Cent Suisses , as
preliminary rendezvous for them ; in that void Palace of the Tuileries ,
now void and National , and not a Palace , but a Caravansera .

As for the Spontaneous Commune , one may say that there never was on
Earth a stranger Town @-@ Council . Administration , not of a great City , but
of a great Kingdom in a state of revolt and frenzy , this is the task
that has fallen to it . Enrolling , provisioning , judging ; devising ,
deciding , doing , endeavouring to do : one wonders the human brain did not
give way under all this , and reel . But happily human brains have such
a talent of taking up simply what they can carry , and ignoring all the
rest ; leaving all the rest , as if it were not there ! Whereby somewhat is
verily shifted for ; and much shifts for itself . This Improvised Commune
walks along , nothing doubting ; promptly making front , without fear or
flurry , at what moment soever , to the wants of the moment . Were the
world on fire , one improvised tricolor Municipal has but one life to
lose . They are the elixir and chosen @-@ men of Sansculottic Patriotism ;
promoted to the forlorn @-@ hope ; unspeakable victory or a high gallows ,
this is their meed . They sit there , in the Townhall , these astonishing
tricolor Municipals ; in Council General ; in Committee of Watchfulness
( de Surveillance , which will even become de Salut Public , of
Public Salvation ) , or what other Committees and Sub @-@ committees are
needful ; -- managing infinite Correspondence ; passing infinite Decrees :
one hears of a Decree being &apos; the ninety @-@ eighth of the day . &apos; Ready !
is the word . They carry loaded pistols in their pocket ; also some
improvised luncheon by way of meal . Or indeed , by and by , traiteurs
contract for the supply of repasts , to be eaten on the spot , -- too
lavishly , as it was afterwards grumbled . Thus they : girt in their
tricolor sashes ; Municipal note @-@ paper in the one hand , fire @-@ arms
in other . They have their Agents out all over France ; speaking in
townhouses , market @-@ places , highways and byways ; agitating , urging to
arm ; all hearts tingling to hear . Great is the fire of Anti @-@ Aristocrat
eloquence : nay some , as Bibliopolic Momoro , seem to hint afar off at
something which smells of Agrarian Law , and a surgery of the overswoln
dropsical strong @-@ box itself ; -- whereat indeed the bold Bookseller runs
risk of being hanged , and Ex @-@ Constituent Buzot has to smuggle him off .
( Memoires de Buzot ( Paris , 1823 ) , p . 88 . )

Governing Persons , were they never so insignificant intrinsically , have
for most part plenty of Memoir @-@ writers ; and the curious , in after @-@ times ,
can learn minutely their goings out and comings in : which , as men always
love to know their fellow @-@ men in singular situations , is a comfort , of
its kind . Not so , with these Governing Persons , now in the Townhall !
And yet what most original fellow @-@ man , of the Governing sort ,
high @-@ chancellor , king , kaiser , secretary of the home or the foreign
department , ever shewed such a phasis as Clerk Tallien , Procureur
Manuel , future Procureur Chaumette , here in this Sand @-@ waltz of the
Twenty @-@ five millions , now do ? O brother mortals , -- thou Advocate Panis ,
friend of Danton , kinsman of Santerre ; Engraver Sergent , since called
Agate Sergent ; thou Huguenin , with the tocsin in thy heart ! But , as
Horace says , they wanted the sacred memoir @-@ writer ( sacro vate ) ; and we
know them not . Men bragged of August and its doings , publishing them in
high places ; but of this September none now or afterwards would
brag . The September world remains dark , fuliginous , as Lapland
witch @-@ midnight ; -- from which , indeed , very strange shapes will evolve
themselves .

Understand this , however : that incorruptible Robespierre is not wanting ,
now when the brunt of battle is past ; in a stealthy way the seagreen man
sits there , his feline eyes excellent in the twilight . Also understand
this other , a single fact worth many : that Marat is not only there , but
has a seat of honour assigned him , a tribune particuliere . How changed
for Marat ; lifted from his dark cellar into this luminous &apos; peculiar
tribune ! &apos; All dogs have their day ; even rabid dogs . Sorrowful , incurable
Philoctetes Marat ; without whom Troy cannot be taken ! Hither , as a main
element of the Governing Power , has Marat been raised . Royalist types ,
for we have &apos; suppressed &apos; innumerable Durosoys , Royous , and even clapt
them in prison , -- Royalist types replace the worn types often snatched
from a People &apos;s @-@ Friend in old ill days . In our &apos; peculiar tribune &apos; we
write and redact : Placards , of due monitory terror ; Amis @-@ du @-@ Peuple ( now
under the name of Journal de la Republique ) ; and sit obeyed of men .
&apos;Marat , &apos; says one , &apos; is the conscience of the Hotel @-@ de @-@ Ville . &apos; Keeper ,
as some call it , of the Sovereign &apos;s Conscience ; -- which surely , in such
hands , will not lie hid in a napkin !

Two great movements , as we said , agitate this distracted National mind :
a rushing against domestic Traitors , a rushing against foreign Despots .
Mad movements both , restrainable by no known rule ; strongest passions
of human nature driving them on : love , hatred ; vengeful sorrow , braggart
Nationality also vengeful , -- and pale Panic over all ! Twelve Hundred
slain Patriots , do they not , from their dark catacombs there , in
Death &apos;s dumb @-@ shew , plead ( O ye Legislators ) for vengeance ? Such was the
destructive rage of these Aristocrats on the ever @-@ memorable Tenth . Nay ,
apart from vengeance , and with an eye to Public Salvation only , are
there not still , in this Paris ( in round numbers ) &apos; thirty thousand
Aristocrats , &apos; of the most malignant humour ; driven now to their last
trump @-@ card ? -- Be patient , ye Patriots : our New High Court , &apos; Tribunal of
the Seventeenth , &apos; sits ; each Section has sent Four Jurymen ; and Danton ,
extinguishing improper judges , improper practices wheresoever found , is
&apos;the same man you have known at the Cordeliers . &apos; With such a Minister
of Justice shall not Justice be done ? -- Let it be swift then , answers
universal Patriotism ; swift and sure ! --

One would hope , this Tribunal of the Seventeenth is swifter than most .
Already on the 21st , while our Court is but four days old , Collenot
d &apos;Angremont , &apos; the Royal enlister &apos; ( crimp , embaucheur ) dies by
torch @-@ light . For , lo , the great Guillotine , wondrous to behold , now
stands there ; the Doctor &apos;s Idea has become Oak and Iron ; the huge
cyclopean axe &apos; falls in its grooves like the ram of the Pile @-@ engine , &apos;
swiftly snuffing out the light of men ? &apos; &apos; Mais vous , Gualches , what have
you invented ? &apos; This ? -- Poor old Laporte , Intendant of the Civil List ,
follows next ; quietly , the mild old man . Then Durosoy , Royalist
Placarder , &apos; cashier of all the Anti @-@ Revolutionists of the interior : &apos; he
went rejoicing ; said that a Royalist like him ought to die , of all days
on this day , the 25th or Saint Louis &apos;s Day . All these have been tried ,
cast , -- the Galleries shouting approval ; and handed over to the Realised
Idea , within a week . Besides those whom we have acquitted , the Galleries
murmuring , and have dismissed ; or even have personally guarded back
to Prison , as the Galleries took to howling , and even to menacing and
elbowing . ( Moore &apos;s Journal , i . 159 @-@ 168 . ) Languid this Tribunal is not .

Nor does the other movement slacken ; the rushing against foreign
Despots . Strong forces shall meet in death @-@ grip ; drilled Europe against
mad undrilled France ; and singular conclusions will be tried . -- Conceive
therefore , in some faint degree , the tumult that whirls in this France ,
in this Paris ! Placards from Section , from Commune , from Legislative ,
from the individual Patriot , flame monitory on all walls . Flags of
Danger to Fatherland wave at the Hotel @-@ de @-@ Ville ; on the Pont Neuf -- over
the prostrate Statues of Kings . There is universal enlisting , urging to
enlist ; there is tearful @-@ boastful leave @-@ taking ; irregular marching on
the Great North @-@ Eastern Road . Marseillese sing their wild To Arms , in
chorus ; which now all men , all women and children have learnt , and sing
chorally , in Theatres , Boulevards , Streets ; and the heart burns in every
bosom : Aux Armes ! Marchons ! -- Or think how your Aristocrats are skulking
into covert ; how Bertrand @-@ Moleville lies hidden in some garret &apos; in
Aubry @-@ le @-@ boucher Street , with a poor surgeon who had known me ; &apos; Dame de
Stael has secreted her Narbonne , not knowing what in the world to make
of him . The Barriers are sometimes open , oftenest shut ; no passports
to be had ; Townhall Emissaries , with the eyes and claws of falcons ,
flitting watchful on all points of your horizon ! In two words : Tribunal
of the Seventeenth , busy under howling Galleries ; Prussian Brunswick ,
&apos;over a space of forty miles , &apos; with his war @-@ tumbrils , and sleeping
thunders , and Briarean &apos; sixty @-@ six thousand &apos; ( See Toulongeon , Hist. de
France. ii. c . 5 . ) right @-@ hands , -- coming , coming !

O Heavens , in these latter days of August , he is come ! Durosoy was not
yet guillotined when news had come that the Prussians were harrying and
ravaging about Metz ; in some four days more , one hears that Longwi , our
first strong @-@ place on the borders , is fallen &apos; in fifteen hours . &apos; Quick ,
therefore , O ye improvised Municipals ; quick , and ever quicker ! -- The
improvised Municipals make front to this also . Enrolment urges itself ;
and clothing , and arming . Our very officers have now &apos; wool epaulettes ; &apos;
for it is the reign of Equality , and also of Necessity . Neither do men
now monsieur and sir one another ; citoyen ( citizen ) were suitabler ; we
even say thou , as &apos; the free peoples of Antiquity did : &apos; so have Journals
and the Improvised Commune suggested ; which shall be well .

Infinitely better , meantime , could we suggest , where arms are to be
found . For the present , our Citoyens chant chorally To Arms ; and have no
arms ! Arms are searched for ; passionately ; there is joy over any musket .
Moreover , entrenchments shall be made round Paris : on the slopes of
Montmartre men dig and shovel ; though even the simple suspect this to
be desperate . They dig ; Tricolour sashes speak encouragement and
well @-@ speed @-@ ye . Nay finally &apos; twelve Members of the Legislative go daily , &apos;
not to encourage only , but to bear a hand , and delve : it was decreed
with acclamation . Arms shall either be provided ; or else the ingenuity
of man crack itself , and become fatuity . Lean Beaumarchais , thinking
to serve the Fatherland , and do a stroke of trade , in the old way , has
commissioned sixty thousand stand of good arms out of Holland : would
to Heaven , for Fatherland &apos;s sake and his , they were come ! Meanwhile
railings are torn up ; hammered into pikes : chains themselves shall be
welded together , into pikes . The very coffins of the dead are raised ;
for melting into balls . All Church @-@ bells must down into the furnace to
make cannon ; all Church @-@ plate into the mint to make money . Also behold
the fair swan @-@ bevies of Citoyennes that have alighted in Churches ,
and sit there with swan @-@ neck , -- sewing tents and regimentals ! Nor are
Patriotic Gifts wanting , from those that have aught left ; nor stingily
given : the fair Villaumes , mother and daughter , Milliners in the
Rue St.-Martin , give &apos; a silver thimble , and a coin of fifteen sous
( sevenpence halfpenny ) , &apos; with other similar effects ; and offer , at least
the mother does , to mount guard . Men who have not even a thimble , give
a thimbleful , -- were it but of invention . One Citoyen has wrought out the
scheme of a wooden cannon ; which France shall exclusively profit by ,
in the first instance . It is to be made of staves , by the coopers ; -- of
almost boundless calibre , but uncertain as to strength ! Thus they :
hammering , scheming , stitching , founding , with all their heart and with
all their soul . Two bells only are to remain in each Parish , -- for tocsin
and other purposes .

But mark also , precisely while the Prussian batteries were playing their
briskest at Longwi in the North @-@ East , and our dastardly Lavergne saw
nothing for it but surrender , -- south @-@ westward , in remote , patriarchal La
Vendee , that sour ferment about Nonjuring Priests , after long working ,
is ripe , and explodes : at the wrong moment for us ! And so we have &apos; eight
thousand Peasants at Chatillon @-@ sur @-@ Sevre , &apos; who will not be ballotted
for soldiers ; will not have their Curates molested . To whom Bonchamps ,
Laroche @-@ jaquelins , and Seigneurs enough , of a Royalist turn , will
join themselves ; with Stofflets and Charettes ; with Heroes and Chouan
Smugglers ; and the loyal warmth of a simple people , blown into flame
and fury by theological and seignorial bellows ! So that there shall be
fighting from behind ditches , death @-@ volleys bursting out of thickets and
ravines of rivers ; huts burning , feet of the pitiful women hurrying to
refuge with their children on their back ; seedfields fallow , whitened
with human bones ; -- &apos; eighty thousand , of all ages , ranks , sexes , flying
at once across the Loire , &apos; with wail borne far on the winds : and , in
brief , for years coming , such a suite of scenes as glorious war has not
offered in these late ages , not since our Albigenses and Crusadings
were over , -- save indeed some chance Palatinate , or so , we might have to
&apos;burn , &apos; by way of exception . The &apos; eight thousand at Chatillon &apos; will be
got dispelled for the moment ; the fire scattered , not extinguished . To
the dints and bruises of outward battle there is to be added henceforth
a deadlier internal gangrene .

This rising in La Vendee reports itself at Paris on Wednesday the 29th
of August ; -- just as we had got our Electors elected ; and , in spite of
Brunswick &apos;s and Longwi &apos;s teeth , were hoping still to have a National
Convention , if it pleased Heaven . But indeed , otherwise , this Wednesday
is to be regarded as one of the notablest Paris had yet seen : gloomy
tidings come successively , like Job &apos;s messengers ; are met by gloomy
answers . Of Sardinia rising to invade the South @-@ East , and Spain
threatening the South , we do not speak . But are not the Prussians
masters of Longwi ( treacherously yielded , one would say ) ; and preparing
to besiege Verdun ? Clairfait and his Austrians are encompassing
Thionville ; darkening the North . Not Metz @-@ land now , but the Clermontais
is getting harried ; flying hulans and huzzars have been seen on the
Chalons Road , almost as far as Sainte @-@ Menehould . Heart , ye Patriots , if
ye lose heart , ye lose all !

It is not without a dramatic emotion that one reads in the Parliamentary
Debates of this Wednesday evening &apos; past seven o &apos;clock , &apos; the scene with
the military fugitives from Longwi . Wayworn , dusty , disheartened , these
poor men enter the Legislative , about sunset or after ; give the most
pathetic detail of the frightful pass they were in : -- Prussians billowing
round by the myriad , volcanically spouting fire for fifteen hours : we ,
scattered sparse on the ramparts , hardly a cannoneer to two guns ; our
dastard Commandant Lavergne no where shewing face ; the priming would
not catch ; there was no powder in the bombs , -- what could we do ? &quot; Mourir !
Die ! &quot; answer prompt voices ; ( Hist . Parl. xvii . 148 . ) and the dusty
fugitives must shrink elsewhither for comfort . -- Yes , Mourir , that is now
the word . Be Longwi a proverb and a hissing among French strong @-@ places :
let it ( says the Legislative ) be obliterated rather , from the shamed
face of the Earth ; -- and so there has gone forth Decree , that Longwi
shall , were the Prussians once out of it , &apos; be rased , &apos; and exist only as
ploughed ground .

Nor are the Jacobins milder ; as how could they , the flower of
Patriotism ? Poor Dame Lavergne , wife of the poor Commandant , took her
parasol one evening , and escorted by her Father came over to the Hall of
the mighty Mother ; and &apos; reads a memoir tending to justify the Commandant
of Longwi . &apos; Lafarge , President , makes answer : &quot; Citoyenne , the Nation
will judge Lavergne ; the Jacobins are bound to tell him the truth . He
would have ended his course there ( termine sa carriere ) , if he had loved
the honour of his country . &quot; ( Ibid. xix . 300 . )



Chapter 3.1.II.

Danton .

But better than raising of Longwi , or rebuking poor dusty soldiers or
soldiers &apos; wives , Danton had come over , last night , and demanded a
Decree to search for arms , since they were not yielded voluntarily . Let
&apos;Domiciliary visits , &apos; with rigour of authority , be made to this end . To
search for arms ; for horses , -- Aristocratism rolls in its carriage , while
Patriotism cannot trail its cannon . To search generally for munitions of
war , &apos; in the houses of persons suspect , &apos; -- and even , if it seem proper ,
to seize and imprison the suspect persons themselves ! In the Prisons ,
their plots will be harmless ; in the Prisons , they will be as hostages
for us , and not without use . This Decree the energetic Minister of
Justice demanded , last night , and got ; and this same night it is to be
executed ; it is being executed , at the moment when these dusty soldiers
get saluted with Mourir . Two thousand stand of arms , as they count , are
foraged in this way ; and some four hundred head of new Prisoners ; and ,
on the whole , such a terror and damp is struck through the Aristocrat
heart , as all but Patriotism , and even Patriotism were it out of this
agony , might pity . Yes , Messieurs ! if Brunswick blast Paris to ashes ,
he probably will blast the Prisons of Paris too : pale Terror , if we have
got it , we will also give it , and the depth of horrors that lie in it ;
the same leaky bottom , in these wild waters , bears us all .

One can judge what stir there was now among the &apos; thirty thousand
Royalists : &apos; how the Plotters , or the accused of Plotting , shrank each
closer into his lurking @-@ place , -- like Bertrand Moleville , looking eager
towards Longwi , hoping the weather would keep fair . Or how they dressed
themselves in valet &apos;s clothes , like Narbonne , and &apos; got to England as Dr.
Bollman &apos;s famulus : &apos; how Dame de Stael bestirred herself , pleading with
Manuel as a Sister in Literature , pleading even with Clerk Tallien ; a
pray to nameless chagrins ! ( De Stael , Considerations sur la Revolution ,
ii . 67 @-@ 81 . ) Royalist Peltier , the Pamphleteer , gives a touching
Narrative ( not deficient in height of colouring ) of the terrors of
that night . From five in the afternoon , a great City is struck suddenly
silent ; except for the beating of drums , for the tramp of marching
feet ; and ever and anon the dread thunder of the knocker at some door , a
Tricolor Commissioner with his blue Guards ( black @-@ guards ! ) arriving .
All Streets are vacant , says Peltier ; beset by Guards at each end : all
Citizens are ordered to be within doors . On the River float sentinal
barges , lest we escape by water : the Barriers hermetically closed .
Frightful ! The sun shines ; serenely westering , in smokeless
mackerel @-@ sky : Paris is as if sleeping , as if dead : -- Paris is holding
its breath , to see what stroke will fall on it . Poor Peltier ! Acts of
Apostles , and all jocundity of Leading @-@ Articles , are gone out , and it is
become bitter earnest instead ; polished satire changed now into coarse
pike @-@ points ( hammered out of railing ) ; all logic reduced to this one
primitive thesis , An eye for an eye , a tooth for a tooth ! -- Peltier ,
dolefully aware of it , ducks low ; escapes unscathed to England ; to
urge there the inky war anew ; to have Trial by Jury , in due season , and
deliverance by young Whig eloquence , world @-@ celebrated for a day .

Of &apos; thirty thousand , &apos; naturally , great multitudes were left unmolested :
but , as we said , some four hundred , designated as &apos; persons suspect , &apos;
were seized ; and an unspeakable terror fell on all . Wo to him who is
guilty of Plotting , of Anticivism , Royalism , Feuillantism ; who , guilty
or not guilty , has an enemy in his Section to call him guilty ! Poor old
M. de Cazotte is seized , his young loved Daughter with him , refusing
to quit him . Why , O Cazotte , wouldst thou quit romancing , and Diable
Amoureux , for such reality as this ? Poor old M. de Sombreuil , he of the
Invalides , is seized : a man seen askance , by Patriotism ever since the
Bastille days : whom also a fond Daughter will not quit . With young tears
hardly suppressed , and old wavering weakness rousing itself once more -- O
my brothers , O my sisters !

The famed and named go ; the nameless , if they have an accuser . Necklace
Lamotte &apos;s Husband is in these Prisons ( she long since squelched on the
London Pavements ) ; but gets delivered . Gross de Morande , of the Courier
de l &apos;Europe , hobbles distractedly to and fro there : but they let him
hobble out ; on right nimble crutches ; -- his hour not being yet come .
Advocate Maton de la Varenne , very weak in health , is snatched off from
mother and kin ; Tricolor Rossignol ( journeyman goldsmith and scoundrel
lately , a risen man now ) remembers an old Pleading of Maton &apos;s ! Jourgniac
de Saint @-@ Meard goes ; the brisk frank soldier : he was in the Mutiny
of Nancy , in that &apos; effervescent Regiment du Roi , &apos; -- on the wrong side .
Saddest of all : Abbe Sicard goes ; a Priest who could not take the Oath ,
but who could teach the Deaf and Dumb : in his Section one man , he
says , had a grudge at him ; one man , at the fit hour , launches an arrest
against him ; which hits . In the Arsenal quarter , there are dumb hearts
making wail , with signs , with wild gestures ; he their miraculous healer
and speech @-@ bringer is rapt away .

What with the arrestments on this night of the Twenty @-@ ninth , what with
those that have gone on more or less , day and night , ever since the
Tenth , one may fancy what the Prisons now were . Crowding and Confusion ;
jostle , hurry , vehemence and terror ! Of the poor Queen &apos;s Friends , who
had followed her to the Temple and been committed elsewhither to
Prison , some , as Governess de Tourzelle , are to be let go : one , the poor
Princess de Lamballe , is not let go ; but waits in the strong @-@ rooms of La
Force there , what will betide further .

Among so many hundreds whom the launched arrest hits , who are rolled
off to Townhall or Section @-@ hall , to preliminary Houses of detention , and
hurled in thither , as into cattle @-@ pens , we must mention one other : Caron
de Beaumarchais , Author of Figaro ; vanquisher of Maupeou Parlements and
Goezman helldogs ; once numbered among the demigods ; and now -- ? We left
him in his culminant state ; what dreadful decline is this , when we again
catch a glimpse of him ! &apos; At midnight &apos; ( it was but the 12th of August
yet ) , &apos; the servant , in his shirt , &apos; with wide @-@ staring eyes , enters your
room : -- Monsieur , rise ; all the people are come to seek you ; they are
knocking , like to break in the door ! &apos; And they were in fact knocking in
a terrible manner ( d &apos;une facon terrible ) . I fling on my coat , forgetting
even the waistcoat , nothing on my feet but slippers ; and say to
him &apos; -- And he , alas , answers mere negatory incoherences , panic
interjections . And through the shutters and crevices , in front or
rearward , the dull street @-@ lamps disclose only streetfuls of haggard
countenances ; clamorous , bristling with pikes : and you rush distracted
for an outlet , finding none ; -- and have to take refuge in the
crockery @-@ press , down stairs ; and stand there , palpitating in that
imperfect costume , lights dancing past your key @-@ hole , tramp of feet
overhead , and the tumult of Satan , &apos; for four hours and more ! &apos; And old
ladies , of the quarter , started up ( as we hear next morning ) ; rang
for their Bonnes and cordial @-@ drops , with shrill interjections : and old
gentlemen , in their shirts , &apos; leapt garden @-@ walls ; &apos; flying , while none
pursued ; one of whom unfortunately broke his leg . ( Beaumarchais&apos;
Narrative , Memoires sur les Prisons ( Paris , 1823 ) , i . 179 @-@ 90 . ) Those
sixty thousand stand of Dutch arms ( which never arrive ) , and the bold
stroke of trade , have turned out so ill ! --

Beaumarchais escaped for this time ; but not for the next time , ten days
after . On the evening of the Twenty @-@ ninth he is still in that chaos of
the Prisons , in saddest , wrestling condition ; unable to get justice ,
even to get audience ; &apos; Panis scratching his head &apos; when you speak to him ,
and making off . Nevertheless let the lover of Figaro know that Procureur
Manuel , a Brother in Literature , found him , and delivered him once more .
But how the lean demigod , now shorn of his splendour , had to lurk in
barns , to roam over harrowed fields , panting for life ; and to wait under
eavesdrops , and sit in darkness &apos; on the Boulevard amid paving @-@ stones and
boulders , &apos; longing for one word of any Minister , or Minister &apos;s Clerk ,
about those accursed Dutch muskets , and getting none , -- with heart fuming
in spleen , and terror , and suppressed canine @-@ madness : alas , how the
swift sharp hound , once fit to be Diana &apos;s , breaks his old teeth now ,
gnawing mere whinstones ; and must &apos; fly to England ; &apos; and , returning
from England , must creep into the corner , and lie quiet , toothless
( moneyless ) , -- all this let the lover of Figaro fancy , and weep for .
We here , without weeping , not without sadness , wave the withered tough
fellow @-@ mortal our farewell . His Figaro has returned to the French stage ;
nay is , at this day , sometimes named the best piece there . And indeed ,
so long as Man &apos;s Life can ground itself only on artificiality and
aridity ; each new Revolt and Change of Dynasty turning up only a new
stratum of dry rubbish , and no soil yet coming to view , -- may it not
be good to protest against such a Life , in many ways , and even in the
Figaro way ?



Chapter 3.1.III.

Dumouriez .

Such are the last days of August , 1792 ; days gloomy , disastrous , and of
evil omen . What will become of this poor France ? Dumouriez rode from
the Camp of Maulde , eastward to Sedan , on Tuesday last , the 28th of the
month ; reviewed that so @-@ called Army left forlorn there by Lafayette : the
forlorn soldiers gloomed on him ; were heard growling on him , &quot; This
is one of them , ce b -- e la , that made War be declared . &quot; ( Dumouriez ,
Memoires , ii . 383 . ) Unpromising Army ! Recruits flow in , filtering
through Depot after Depot ; but recruits merely : in want of all ; happy if
they have so much as arms . And Longwi has fallen basely ; and Brunswick ,
and the Prussian King , with his sixty thousand , will beleaguer Verdun ;
and Clairfait and Austrians press deeper in , over the Northern marches :
&apos;a hundred and fifty thousand &apos; as fear counts , &apos; eighty thousand &apos; as
the returns shew , do hem us in ; Cimmerian Europe behind them . There is
Castries @-@ and @-@ Broglie chivalry ; Royalist foot &apos; in red facing and nankeen
trousers ; &apos; breathing death and the gallows .

And lo , finally ! at Verdun on Sunday the 2d of September 1792 , Brunswick
is here . With his King and sixty thousand , glittering over the heights ,
from beyond the winding Meuse River , he looks down on us , on our &apos; high
citadel &apos; and all our confectionery @-@ ovens ( for we are celebrated for
confectionery ) has sent courteous summons , in order to spare the
effusion of blood ! -- Resist him to the death ? Every day of retardation
precious ? How , O General Beaurepaire ( asks the amazed Municipality )
shall we resist him ? We , the Verdun Municipals , see no resistance
possible . Has he not sixty thousand , and artillery without end ?
Retardation , Patriotism is good ; but so likewise is peaceable baking of
pastry , and sleeping in whole skin . -- Hapless Beaurepaire stretches out
his hands , and pleads passionately , in the name of country , honour , of
Heaven and of Earth : to no purpose . The Municipals have , by law ,
the power of ordering it ; -- with an Army officered by Royalism or
Crypto @-@ Royalism , such a Law seemed needful : and they order it , as
pacific Pastrycooks , not as heroic Patriots would , -- To surrender !
Beaurepaire strides home , with long steps : his valet , entering the room ,
sees him &apos; writing eagerly , &apos; and withdraws . His valet hears then , in
a few minutes , the report of a pistol : Beaurepaire is lying dead ; his
eager writing had been a brief suicidal farewell . In this manner died
Beaurepaire , wept of France ; buried in the Pantheon , with honourable
pension to his Widow , and for Epitaph these words , He chose Death rather
than yield to Despots . The Prussians , descending from the heights , are
peaceable masters of Verdun .

And so Brunswick advances , from stage to stage : who shall now stay
him , -- covering forty miles of country ? Foragers fly far ; the villages of
the North @-@ East are harried ; your Hessian forager has only &apos; three sous a
day : &apos; the very Emigrants , it is said , will take silver @-@ plate , -- by way
of revenge . Clermont , Sainte @-@ Menehould , Varennes especially , ye Towns of
the Night of Spurs ; tremble ye ! Procureur Sausse and the Magistracy of
Varennes have fled ; brave Boniface Le Blanc of the Bras d &apos;Or is to the
woods : Mrs. Le Blanc , a young woman fair to look upon , with her young
infant , has to live in greenwood , like a beautiful Bessy Bell of Song ,
her bower thatched with rushes ; -- catching premature rheumatism . ( Helen
Maria Williams , Letters from France ( London , 1791 @-@ 93 ) , iii . 96 . )
Clermont may ring the tocsin now , and illuminate itself ! Clermont lies
at the foot of its Cow ( or Vache , so they name that Mountain ) , a prey to
the Hessian spoiler : its fair women , fairer than most , are robbed : not
of life , or what is dearer , yet of all that is cheaper and portable ; for
Necessity , on three half @-@ pence a @-@ day , has no law . At Saint @-@ Menehould ,
the enemy has been expected more than once , -- our Nationals all turning
out in arms ; but was not yet seen . Post @-@ master Drouet , he is not in the
woods , but minding his Election ; and will sit in the Convention , notable
King @-@ taker , and bold Old @-@ Dragoon as he is .

Thus on the North @-@ East all roams and runs ; and on a set day , the date
of which is irrecoverable by History , Brunswick &apos; has engaged to dine in
Paris , &apos; -- the Powers willing . And at Paris , in the centre , it is as we
saw ; and in La Vendee , South @-@ West , it is as we saw ; and Sardinia is in
the South @-@ East , and Spain is in the South , and Clairfait with Austria
and sieged Thionville is in the North ; -- and all France leaps distracted ,
like the winnowed Sahara waltzing in sand @-@ colonnades ! More desperate
posture no country ever stood in . A country , one would say , which the
Majesty of Prussia ( if it so pleased him ) might partition , and clip
in pieces , like a Poland ; flinging the remainder to poor Brother
Louis , -- with directions to keep it quiet , or else we will keep it for
him !

Or perhaps the Upper Powers , minded that a new Chapter in Universal
History shall begin here and not further on , may have ordered it all
otherwise ? In that case , Brunswick will not dine in Paris on the set
day ; nor , indeed , one knows not when ! -- Verily , amid this wreckage , where
poor France seems grinding itself down to dust and bottomless ruin , who
knows what miraculous salient @-@ point of Deliverance and New @-@ life may have
already come into existence there ; and be already working there , though
as yet human eye discern it not ! On the night of that same twenty @-@ eighth
of August , the unpromising Review @-@ day in Sedan , Dumouriez assembles a
Council of War at his lodgings there . He spreads out the map of this
forlorn war @-@ district : Prussians here , Austrians there ; triumphant both ,
with broad highway , and little hinderance , all the way to Paris ;
we , scattered helpless , here and here : what to advise ? The Generals ,
strangers to Dumouriez , look blank enough ; know not well what to
advise , -- if it be not retreating , and retreating till our recruits
accumulate ; till perhaps the chapter of chances turn up some leaf for
us ; or Paris , at all events , be sacked at the latest day possible . The
Many @-@ counselled , who &apos; has not closed an eye for three nights , &apos; listens
with little speech to these long cheerless speeches ; merely watching
the speaker that he may know him ; then wishes them all good @-@ night ; -- but
beckons a certain young Thouvenot , the fire of whose looks had pleased
him , to wait a moment . Thouvenot waits : Voila , says Polymetis , pointing
to the map ! That is the Forest of Argonne , that long stripe of rocky
Mountain and wild Wood ; forty miles long ; with but five , or say even
three practicable Passes through it : this , for they have forgotten
it , might one not still seize , though Clairfait sits so nigh ?
Once seized ; -- the Champagne called the Hungry ( or worse , Champagne
Pouilleuse ) on their side of it ; the fat Three Bishoprics , and willing
France , on ours ; and the Equinox @-@ rains not far ; -- this Argonne &apos; might be
the Thermopylae of France ! &apos; ( Dumouriez , ii . 391 . )

O brisk Dumouriez Polymetis with thy teeming head , may the gods grant
it ! -- Polymetis , at any rate , folds his map together , and flings himself
on bed ; resolved to try , on the morrow morning . With astucity , with
swiftness , with audacity ! One had need to be a lion @-@ fox , and have luck
on one &apos;s side .



Chapter 3.1.IV.

September in Paris .

At Paris , by lying Rumour which proved prophetic and veridical , the
fall of Verdun was known some hours before it happened . It is Sunday the
second of September ; handiwork hinders not the speculations of the mind .
Verdun gone ( though some still deny it ) ; the Prussians in full march ,
with gallows @-@ ropes , with fire and faggot ! Thirty thousand Aristocrats
within our own walls ; and but the merest quarter @-@ tithe of them yet put
in Prison ! Nay there goes a word that even these will revolt . Sieur Jean
Julien , wagoner of Vaugirard , ( Moore , i . 178 . ) being set in the Pillory
last Friday , took all at once to crying , That he would be well revenged
ere long ; that the King &apos;s Friends in Prison would burst out ; force the
Temple , set the King on horseback ; and , joined by the unimprisoned , ride
roughshod over us all . This the unfortunate wagoner of Vaugirard did
bawl , at the top of his lungs : when snatched off to the Townhall , he
persisted in it , still bawling ; yesternight , when they guillotined him ,
he died with the froth of it on his lips . ( Hist . Parl. xvii . 409 . ) For
a man &apos;s mind , padlocked to the Pillory , may go mad ; and all men &apos;s minds
may go mad ; and &apos; believe him , &apos; as the frenetic will do , &apos; because it is
impossible . &apos; 

So that apparently the knot of the crisis , and last agony of France
is come ? Make front to this , thou Improvised Commune , strong Danton ,
whatsoever man is strong ! Readers can judge whether the Flag of Country
in Danger flapped soothing or distractively on the souls of men , that
day .

But the Improvised Commune , but strong Danton is not wanting , each
after his kind . Huge Placards are getting plastered to the walls ; at
two o &apos;clock the stormbell shall be sounded , the alarm @-@ cannon fired ;
all Paris shall rush to the Champ @-@ de @-@ Mars , and have itself enrolled .
Unarmed , truly , and undrilled ; but desperate , in the strength of frenzy .
Haste , ye men ; ye very women , offer to mount guard and shoulder the
brown musket : weak clucking @-@ hens , in a state of desperation , will fly
at the muzzle of the mastiff , and even conquer him , -- by vehemence of
character ! Terror itself , when once grown transcendental , becomes a kind
of courage ; as frost sufficiently intense , according to Poet Milton ,
will burn . -- Danton , the other night , in the Legislative Committee
of General Defence , when the other Ministers and Legislators had all
opined , said , It would not do to quit Paris , and fly to Saumur ; that
they must abide by Paris ; and take such attitude as would put their
enemies in fear , -- faire peur ; a word of his which has been often
repeated , and reprinted -- in italics . ( Biographie des Ministres
( Bruxelles , 1826 ) , p . 96 . )

At two of the clock , Beaurepaire , as we saw , has shot himself at Verdun ;
and over Europe , mortals are going in for afternoon sermon . But at
Paris , all steeples are clangouring not for sermon ; the alarm @-@ gun
booming from minute to minute ; Champ @-@ de @-@ Mars and Fatherland &apos;s Altar
boiling with desperate terror @-@ courage : what a miserere going up
to Heaven from this once Capital of the Most Christian King ! The
Legislative sits in alternate awe and effervescence ; Vergniaud proposing
that Twelve shall go and dig personally on Montmartre ; which is decreed
by acclaim .

But better than digging personally with acclaim , see Danton enter ; -- the
black brows clouded , the colossus @-@ figure tramping heavy ; grim energy
looking from all features of the rugged man ! Strong is that grim Son of
France , and Son of Earth ; a Reality and not a Formula he too ; and
surely now if ever , being hurled low enough , it is on the Earth and on
Realities that he rests . &quot; Legislators ! &quot; so speaks the stentor @-@ voice , as
the Newspapers yet preserve it for us , &quot; it is not the alarm @-@ cannon that
you hear : it is the pas @-@ de @-@ charge against our enemies . To conquer them ,
to hurl them back , what do we require ? Il nous faut de l &apos;audace , et
encore de l &apos;audace , et toujours de l &apos;audace , To dare , and again to dare ,
and without end to dare ! &quot; ( Moniteur in Hist . Parl. xvii . 347 . ) -- Right
so , thou brawny Titan ; there is nothing left for thee but that . Old men ,
who heard it , will still tell you how the reverberating voice made all
hearts swell , in that moment ; and braced them to the sticking @-@ place ; and
thrilled abroad over France , like electric virtue , as a word spoken in
season .

But the Commune , enrolling in the Champ @-@ de @-@ Mars ? But the Committee of
Watchfulness , become now Committee of Public Salvation ; whose conscience
is Marat ? The Commune enrolling enrolls many ; provides Tents for them in
that Mars &apos; -Field , that they may march with dawn on the morrow : praise to
this part of the Commune ! To Marat and the Committee of Watchfulness
not praise ; -- not even blame , such as could be meted out in these
insufficient dialects of ours ; expressive silence rather ! Lone Marat ,
the man forbid , meditating long in his Cellars of refuge , on his
Stylites Pillar , could see salvation in one thing only : in the fall of
&apos;two hundred and sixty thousand Aristocrat heads . &apos; With so many score
of Naples Bravoes , each a dirk in his right @-@ hand , a muff on his left ,
he would traverse France , and do it . But the world laughed , mocking the
severe @-@ benevolence of a People &apos;s @-@ Friend ; and his idea could not become
an action , but only a fixed @-@ idea . Lo , now , however , he has come down
from his Stylites Pillar , to a Tribune particuliere ; here now , without
the dirks , without the muffs at least , were it not grown possible , -- now
in the knot of the crisis , when salvation or destruction hangs in the
hour !

The Ice @-@ Tower of Avignon was noised of sufficiently , and lives in
all memories ; but the authors were not punished : nay we saw Jourdan
Coupe @-@ tete , borne on men &apos;s shoulders , like a copper Portent , &apos; traversing
the cities of the South . &apos; -- What phantasms , squalid @-@ horrid , shaking their
dirk and muff , may dance through the brain of a Marat , in this dizzy
pealing of tocsin @-@ miserere , and universal frenzy , seek not to guess ,
O Reader ! Nor what the cruel Billaud &apos; in his short brown coat was
thinking ; &apos; nor Sergent , not yet Agate @-@ Sergent ; nor Panis the confident
of Danton ; -- nor , in a word , how gloomy Orcus does breed in her gloomy
womb , and fashion her monsters , and prodigies of Events , which thou
seest her visibly bear ! Terror is on these streets of Paris ; terror and
rage , tears and frenzy : tocsin @-@ miserere pealing through the air ; fierce
desperation rushing to battle ; mothers , with streaming eyes and wild
hearts , sending forth their sons to die . &apos; Carriage @-@ horses are seized by
the bridle , &apos; that they may draw cannon ; &apos; the traces cut , the carriages
left standing . &apos; In such tocsin @-@ miserere , and murky bewilderment of
Frenzy , are not Murder , Ate , and all Furies near at hand ? On slight
hint , who knows on how slight , may not Murder come ; and , with her
snaky @-@ sparkling hand , illuminate this murk !

How it was and went , what part might be premeditated , what was
improvised and accidental , man will never know , till the great Day of
Judgment make it known . But with a Marat for keeper of the Sovereign &apos;s
Conscience -- And we know what the ultima ratio of Sovereigns , when they
are driven to it , is ! In this Paris there are as many wicked men , say a
hundred or more , as exist in all the Earth : to be hired , and set on ;
to set on , of their own accord , unhired . -- And yet we will remark that
premeditation itself is not performance , is not surety of performance ;
that it is perhaps , at most , surety of letting whosoever wills perform .
From the purpose of crime to the act of crime there is an abyss ;
wonderful to think of . The finger lies on the pistol ; but the man is not
yet a murderer : nay , his whole nature staggering at such consummation ,
is there not a confused pause rather , -- one last instant of possibility
for him ? Not yet a murderer ; it is at the mercy of light trifles whether
the most fixed idea may not yet become unfixed . One slight twitch of a
muscle , the death flash bursts ; and he is it , and will for Eternity be
it ; -- and Earth has become a penal Tartarus for him ; his horizon girdled
now not with golden hope , but with red flames of remorse ; voices from
the depths of Nature sounding , Wo , wo on him !

Of such stuff are we all made ; on such powder @-@ mines of bottomless guilt
and criminality , &apos; if God restrained not ; as is well said , -- does the
purest of us walk . There are depths in man that go the length of lowest
Hell , as there are heights that reach highest Heaven ; -- for are not both
Heaven and Hell made out of him , made by him , everlasting Miracle
and Mystery as he is ? -- But looking on this Champ @-@ de @-@ Mars , with its
tent @-@ buildings , and frantic enrolments ; on this murky @-@ simmering
Paris , with its crammed Prisons ( supposed about to burst ) , with
its tocsin @-@ miserere , its mothers &apos; tears , and soldiers &apos; farewell
shoutings , -- the pious soul might have prayed , that day , that God &apos;s
grace would restrain , and greatly restrain ; lest on slight hest or
hint , Madness , Horror and Murder rose , and this Sabbath @-@ day of September
became a Day black in the Annals of Men . --

The tocsin is pealing its loudest , the clocks inaudibly striking Three ,
when poor Abbe Sicard , with some thirty other Nonjurant Priests , in
six carriages , fare along the streets , from their preliminary House of
Detention at the Townhall , westward towards the Prison of the Abbaye .
Carriages enough stand deserted on the streets ; these six move
on , -- through angry multitudes , cursing as they move . Accursed Aristocrat
Tartuffes , this is the pass ye have brought us to ! And now ye will break
the Prisons , and set Capet Veto on horseback to ride over us ? Out upon
you , Priests of Beelzebub and Moloch ; of Tartuffery , Mammon , and the
Prussian Gallows , -- which ye name Mother @-@ Church and God ! Such reproaches
have the poor Nonjurants to endure , and worse ; spoken in on them by
frantic Patriots , who mount even on the carriage @-@ steps ; the very
Guards hardly refraining . Pull up your carriage @-@ blinds ! -- No ! answers
Patriotism , clapping its horny paw on the carriage blind , and crushing
it down again . Patience in oppression has limits : we are close on the
Abbaye , it has lasted long : a poor Nonjurant , of quicker temper , smites
the horny paw with his cane ; nay , finding solacement in it , smites the
unkempt head , sharply and again more sharply , twice over , -- seen clearly
of us and of the world . It is the last that we see clearly . Alas , next
moment , the carriages are locked and blocked in endless raging tumults ;
in yells deaf to the cry for mercy , which answer the cry for mercy with
sabre @-@ thrusts through the heart . ( Felemhesi ( anagram for Mehee Fils ) , La
Verite tout entiere , sur les vrais auteurs de la journee du 2 Septembre
1792 ( reprinted in Hist . Parl. xviii . 156 @-@ 181 ) , p . 167 . ) The thirty
Priests are torn out , are massacred about the Prison @-@ Gate , one after
one , -- only the poor Abbe Sicard , whom one Moton a watchmaker , knowing
him , heroically tried to save , and secrete in the Prison , escapes to
tell ; -- and it is Night and Orcus , and Murder &apos;s snaky @-@ sparkling head has
risen in the murk ! --

From Sunday afternoon ( exclusive of intervals , and pauses not final )
till Thursday evening , there follow consecutively a Hundred Hours .
Which hundred hours are to be reckoned with the hours of the Bartholomew
Butchery , of the Armagnac Massacres , Sicilian Vespers , or whatsoever is
savagest in the annals of this world . Horrible the hour when man &apos;s soul ,
in its paroxysm , spurns asunder the barriers and rules ; and shews what
dens and depths are in it ! For Night and Orcus , as we say , as was
long prophesied , have burst forth , here in this Paris , from their
subterranean imprisonment : hideous , dim , confused ; which it is painful
to look on ; and yet which cannot , and indeed which should not , be
forgotten .

The Reader , who looks earnestly through this dim Phantasmagory of the
Pit , will discern few fixed certain objects ; and yet still a few . He
will observe , in this Abbaye Prison , the sudden massacre of the Priests
being once over , a strange Court of Justice , or call it Court of Revenge
and Wild @-@ Justice , swiftly fashion itself , and take seat round a table ,
with the Prison @-@ Registers spread before it ; -- Stanislas Maillard ,
Bastille @-@ hero , famed Leader of the Menads , presiding . O Stanislas , one
hoped to meet thee elsewhere than here ; thou shifty Riding @-@ Usher , with
an inkling of Law ! This work also thou hadst to do ; and then -- to depart
for ever from our eyes . At La Force , at the Chatelet , the Conciergerie ,
the like Court forms itself , with the like accompaniments : the thing
that one man does other men can do . There are some Seven Prisons in
Paris , full of Aristocrats with conspiracies ; -- nay not even Bicetre and
Salpetriere shall escape , with their Forgers of Assignats : and there
are seventy times seven hundred Patriot hearts in a state of frenzy .
Scoundrel hearts also there are ; as perfect , say , as the Earth
holds , -- if such are needed . To whom , in this mood , law is as no @-@ law ; and
killing , by what name soever called , is but work to be done .

So sit these sudden Courts of Wild @-@ Justice , with the Prison @-@ Registers
before them ; unwonted wild tumult howling all round : the Prisoners
in dread expectancy within . Swift : a name is called ; bolts jingle , a
Prisoner is there . A few questions are put ; swiftly this sudden Jury
decides : Royalist Plotter or not ? Clearly not ; in that case , Let the
Prisoner be enlarged With Vive la Nation . Probably yea ; then still , Let
the Prisoner be enlarged , but without Vive la Nation ; or else it may
run , Let the prisoner be conducted to La Force . At La Force again their
formula is , Let the Prisoner be conducted to the Abbaye . -- &quot; To La Force
then ! &quot; Volunteer bailiffs seize the doomed man ; he is at the outer gate ;
&apos;enlarged , &apos; or &apos; conducted , &apos; -- not into La Force , but into a howling sea ;
forth , under an arch of wild sabres , axes and pikes ; and sinks , hewn
asunder . And another sinks , and another ; and there forms itself a piled
heap of corpses , and the kennels begin to run red . Fancy the yells of
these men , their faces of sweat and blood ; the crueller shrieks of these
women , for there are women too ; and a fellow @-@ mortal hurled naked into it
all ! Jourgniac de Saint Meard has seen battle , has seen an effervescent
Regiment du Roi in mutiny ; but the bravest heart may quail at this . The
Swiss Prisoners , remnants of the Tenth of August , &apos; clasped each other
spasmodically , &apos; and hung back ; grey veterans crying : &quot; Mercy Messieurs ;
ah , mercy ! &quot; But there was no mercy . Suddenly , however , one of these men
steps forward . He had a blue frock coat ; he seemed to be about thirty ,
his stature was above common , his look noble and martial . &quot; I go first , &quot;
said he , &quot; since it must be so : adieu ! &quot; Then dashing his hat sharply
behind him : &quot; Which way ? &quot; cried he to the Brigands : &quot; Shew it me , then . &quot;
They open the folding gate ; he is announced to the multitude . He stands
a moment motionless ; then plunges forth among the pikes , and dies of
a thousand wounds . &apos; ( Felemhesi , La Verite tout entiere ( ut supra ) , p .
173 . )

Man after man is cut down ; the sabres need sharpening , the killers
refresh themselves from wine jugs . Onward and onward goes the butchery ;
the loud yells wearying down into bass growls . A sombre @-@ faced , shifting
multitude looks on ; in dull approval , or dull disapproval ; in dull
recognition that it is Necessity . &apos; An Anglais in drab greatcoat&apos;
was seen , or seemed to be seen , serving liquor from his own
dram @-@ bottle ; -- for what purpose , &apos; if not set on by Pitt , &apos; Satan and
himself know best ! Witty Dr. Moore grew sick on approaching , and turned
into another street . ( Moore &apos;s Journal , i . 185 @-@ 195 . ) -- Quick enough
goes this Jury @-@ Court ; and rigorous . The brave are not spared , nor the
beautiful , nor the weak . Old M. de Montmorin , the Minister &apos;s Brother ,
was acquitted by the Tribunal of the Seventeenth ; and conducted back ,
elbowed by howling galleries ; but is not acquitted here . Princess de
Lamballe has lain down on bed : &quot; Madame , you are to be removed to the
Abbaye . &quot; &quot; I do not wish to remove ; I am well enough here . &quot; There is a
need @-@ be for removing . She will arrange her dress a little , then ;
rude voices answer , &quot; You have not far to go . &quot; She too is led to the
hell @-@ gate ; a manifest Queen &apos;s @-@ Friend . She shivers back , at the sight of
bloody sabres ; but there is no return : Onwards ! That fair hindhead
is cleft with the axe ; the neck is severed . That fair body is cut
in fragments ; with indignities , and obscene horrors of moustachio
grands @-@ levres , which human nature would fain find incredible , -- which
shall be read in the original language only . She was beautiful , she
was good , she had known no happiness . Young hearts , generation after
generation , will think with themselves : O worthy of worship , thou
king @-@ descended , god @-@ descended and poor sister @-@ woman ! why was not I
there ; and some Sword Balmung , or Thor &apos;s Hammer in my hand ? Her head is
fixed on a pike ; paraded under the windows of the Temple ; that a still
more hated , a Marie @-@ Antoinette , may see . One Municipal , in the Temple
with the Royal Prisoners at the moment , said , &quot; Look out . &quot; Another
eagerly whispered , &quot; Do not look . &quot; The circuit of the Temple is guarded ,
in these hours , by a long stretched tricolor riband : terror enters , and
the clangour of infinite tumult : hitherto not regicide , though that too
may come .

But it is more edifying to note what thrillings of affection , what
fragments of wild virtues turn up , in this shaking asunder of man &apos;s
existence , for of these too there is a proportion . Note old Marquis
Cazotte : he is doomed to die ; but his young Daughter clasps him in her
arms , with an inspiration of eloquence , with a love which is stronger
than very death ; the heart of the killers themselves is touched by it ;
the old man is spared . Yet he was guilty , if plotting for his King is
guilt : in ten days more , a Court of Law condemned him , and he had to die
elsewhere ; bequeathing his Daughter a lock of his old grey hair . Or
note old M. de Sombreuil , who also had a Daughter : -- My Father is not an
Aristocrat ; O good gentlemen , I will swear it , and testify it , and in
all ways prove it ; we are not ; we hate Aristocrats ! &quot; Wilt thou drink
Aristocrats &apos; blood ? &quot; The man lifts blood ( if universal Rumour can be
credited ( Dulaure : Esquisses Historiques des principaux evenemens de
la Revolution , ii . 206 ( cited in Montgaillard , iii . 205 . ) ; the poor
maiden does drink . &quot; This Sombreuil is innocent then ! &quot; Yes indeed , -- and
now note , most of all , how the bloody pikes , at this news , do rattle to
the ground ; and the tiger @-@ yells become bursts of jubilee over a brother
saved ; and the old man and his daughter are clasped to bloody bosoms ,
with hot tears , and borne home in triumph of Vive la Nation , the killers
refusing even money ! Does it seem strange , this temper of theirs ?
It seems very certain , well proved by Royalist testimony in other
instances ; ( Bertrand @-@ Moleville , Mem . Particuliers , ii.213 , &amp; c . &amp; c . ) and
very significant .



Chapter 3.1.V.

A Trilogy .

As all Delineation , in these ages , were it never so Epic , &apos; speaking
itself and not singing itself , &apos; must either found on Belief and provable
Fact , or have no foundation at all ( nor except as floating cobweb any
existence at all ) , -- the Reader will perhaps prefer to take a glance with
the very eyes of eye @-@ witnesses ; and see , in that way , for himself , how
it was . Brave Jourgniac , innocent Abbe Sicard , judicious Advocate Maton ,
these , greatly compressing themselves , shall speak , each an instant .
Jourgniac &apos;s Agony of Thirty @-@ eight hours went through &apos; above a hundred
editions , &apos; though intrinsically a poor work . Some portion of it may here
go through above the hundred @-@ and @-@ first , for want of a better .

&apos;Towards seven o &apos;clock &apos; ( Sunday night , at the Abbaye ; for Jourgniac
goes by dates ) : &apos; We saw two men enter , their hands bloody and armed with
sabres ; a turnkey , with a torch , lighted them ; he pointed to the bed of
the unfortunate Swiss , Reding . Reding spoke with a dying voice . One of
them paused ; but the other cried Allons donc ; lifted the unfortunate
man ; carried him out on his back to the street . He was massacred there .

&apos;We all looked at one another in silence , we clasped each other &apos;s hands .
Motionless , with fixed eyes , we gazed on the pavement of our prison ;
on which lay the moonlight , checkered with the triple stancheons of our
windows .

&apos;Three in the morning : They were breaking @-@ in one of the prison @-@ doors . We
at first thought they were coming to kill us in our room ; but heard ,
by voices on the staircase , that it was a room where some Prisoners
had barricaded themselves . They were all butchered there , as we shortly
gathered .

&apos;Ten o &apos;clock : The Abbe Lenfant and the Abbe de Chapt @-@ Rastignac appeared
in the pulpit of the Chapel , which was our prison ; they had entered by a
door from the stairs . They said to us that our end was at hand ; that
we must compose ourselves , and receive their last blessing . An electric
movement , not to be defined , threw us all on our knees , and we received
it . These two whitehaired old men , blessing us from their place above ;
death hovering over our heads , on all hands environing us ; the moment is
never to be forgotten . Half an hour after , they were both massacred , and
we heard their cries . &apos; ( Jourgniac Saint @-@ Meard , Mon Agonie de Trente @-@ huit
heures , reprinted in Hist . Parl. xviii . 103 @-@ 135 . ) -- Thus Jourgniac in
his Agony in the Abbaye .

But now let the good Maton speak , what he , over in La Force , in the same
hours , is suffering and witnessing . This Resurrection by him is greatly
the best , the least theatrical of these Pamphlets ; and stands testing by
documents :

&apos;Towards seven o &apos;clock , &apos; on Sunday night , &apos; prisoners were called
frequently , and they did not reappear . Each of us reasoned in his own
way , on this singularity : but our ideas became calm , as we persuaded
ourselves that the Memorial I had drawn up for the National Assembly was
producing effect .

&apos;At one in the morning , the grate which led to our quarter opened anew .
Four men in uniform , each with a drawn sabre and blazing torch , came up
to our corridor , preceded by a turnkey ; and entered an apartment close
to ours , to investigate a box there , which we heard them break up . This
done , they stept into the gallery , and questioned the man Cuissa , to
know where Lamotte ( Necklace &apos;s Widower ) was . Lamotte , they said , had
some months ago , under pretext of a treasure he knew of , swindled a sum
of three @-@ hundred livres from one of them , inviting him to dinner for
that purpose . The wretched Cuissa , now in their hands , who indeed lost
his life this night , answered trembling , That he remembered the fact
well , but could not tell what was become of Lamotte . Determined to find
Lamotte and confront him with Cuissa , they rummaged , along with this
latter , through various other apartments ; but without effect , for we
heard them say : &quot; Come search among the corpses then : for , nom de Dieu !
we must find where he is . &quot;

&apos;At this time , I heard Louis Bardy , the Abbe Bardy &apos;s name called : he was
brought out ; and directly massacred , as I learnt . He had been accused ,
along with his concubine , five or six years before , of having murdered
and cut in pieces his own Brother , Auditor of the Chambre des Comptes at
Montpelier ; but had by his subtlety , his dexterity , nay his eloquence ,
outwitted the judges , and escaped .

&apos;One may fancy what terror these words , &quot; Come search among the corpses
then , &quot; had thrown me into . I saw nothing for it now but resigning
myself to die . I wrote my last @-@ will ; concluding it by a petition and
adjuration , that the paper should be sent to its address . Scarcely had I
quitted the pen , when there came two other men in uniform ; one of them ,
whose arm and sleeve up to the very shoulder , as well as the sabre ,
were covered with blood , said , He was as weary as a hodman that had been
beating plaster .

&apos;Baudin de la Chenaye was called ; sixty years of virtues could not save
him . They said , &quot; A l &apos;Abbaye : &quot; he passed the fatal outer @-@ gate ; gave a
cry of terror , at sight of the heaped corpses ; covered his eyes with
his hands , and died of innumerable wounds . At every new opening of the
grate , I thought I should hear my own name called , and see Rossignol
enter .

&apos;I flung off my nightgown and cap ; I put on a coarse unwashed shirt , a
worn frock without waistcoat , an old round hat ; these things I had sent
for , some days ago , in the fear of what might happen .

&apos;The rooms of this corridor had been all emptied but ours . We were four
together ; whom they seemed to have forgotten : we addressed our prayers
in common to the Eternal to be delivered from this peril .

&apos;Baptiste the turnkey came up by himself , to see us . I took him by the
hands ; I conjured him to save us ; promised him a hundred louis , if he
would conduct me home . A noise coming from the grates made him hastily
withdraw .

&apos;It was the noise of some dozen or fifteen men , armed to the teeth ; as
we , lying flat to escape being seen , could see from our windows : &quot; Up
stairs ! &quot; said they : &quot; Let not one remain . &quot; I took out my penknife ; I
considered where I should strike myself , &apos; -- but reflected &apos; that the blade
was too short , &apos; and also &apos; on religion . &apos; 

Finally , however , between seven and eight o &apos;clock in the morning , enter
four men with bludgeons and sabres ! -- &apos; to one of whom Gerard my comrade
whispered , earnestly , apart . During their colloquy I searched every
where for shoes , that I might lay off the Advocate pumps ( pantoufles de
Palais ) I had on , &apos; but could find none . -- &apos; Constant , called le Sauvage ,
Gerard , and a third whose name escapes me , they let clear off : as for
me , four sabres were crossed over my breast , and they led me down . I was
brought to their bar ; to the Personage with the scarf , who sat as judge
there . He was a lame man , of tall lank stature . He recognised me on the
streets , and spoke to me seven months after . I have been assured that
he was son of a retired attorney , and named Chepy . Crossing the Court
called Des Nourrices , I saw Manuel haranguing in tricolor scarf . &apos; The
trial , as we see , ends in acquittal and resurrection . ( Maton de la
Varenne , Ma Resurrection in Hist . Parl. xviii . 135 @-@ 156 . )

Poor Sicard , from the violon of the Abbaye , shall say but a few words ;
true @-@ looking , though tremulous . Towards three in the morning , the
killers bethink them of this little violon ; and knock from the court . &apos; I
tapped gently , trembling lest the murderers might hear , on the opposite
door , where the Section Committee was sitting : they answered gruffly
that they had no key . There were three of us in this violon ; my
companions thought they perceived a kind of loft overhead . But it was
very high ; only one of us could reach it , by mounting on the shoulders
of both the others . One of them said to me , that my life was usefuller
than theirs : I resisted , they insisted : no denial ! I fling myself on the
neck of these two deliverers ; never was scene more touching . I mount on
the shoulders of the first , then on those of the second , finally on
the loft ; and address to my two comrades the expression of a soul
overwhelmed with natural emotions . ( Abbe Sicard : Relation adressee a un
de ses amis , Hist . Parl. xviii . 98 @-@ 103 . )

The two generous companions , we rejoice to find , did not perish . But it
is time that Jourgniac de Saint @-@ Meard should speak his last words , and
end this singular trilogy . The night had become day ; and the day has
again become night . Jourgniac , worn down with uttermost agitation , has
fallen asleep , and had a cheering dream : he has also contrived to make
acquaintance with one of the volunteer bailiffs , and spoken in native
Provencal with him . On Tuesday , about one in the morning , his Agony is
reaching its crisis .

&apos;By the glare of two torches , I now descried the terrible tribunal ,
where lay my life or my death . The President , in grey coats , with a
sabre at his side , stood leaning with his hands against a table , on
which were papers , an inkstand , tobacco @-@ pipes and bottles . Some ten
persons were around , seated or standing ; two of whom had jackets and
aprons : others were sleeping stretched on benches . Two men , in bloody
shirts , guarded the door of the place ; an old turnkey had his hand on
the lock . In front of the President , three men held a Prisoner , who
might be about sixty &apos; ( or seventy : he was old Marshal Maille , of the
Tuileries and August Tenth ) . &apos; They stationed me in a corner ; my
guards crossed their sabres on my breast . I looked on all sides for my
Provencal : two National Guards , one of them drunk , presented some appeal
from the Section of Croix Rouge in favour of the Prisoner ; the Man in
Grey answered : &quot; They are useless , these appeals for traitors . &quot; Then the
Prisoner exclaimed : &quot; It is frightful ; your judgment is a murder . &quot; The
President answered ; &quot; My hands are washed of it ; take M. Maille away . &quot;
They drove him into the street ; where , through the opening of the door ,
I saw him massacred .

&apos;The President sat down to write ; registering , I suppose , the name of
this one whom they had finished ; then I heard him say : &quot; Another , A un
autre ! &quot;

&apos;Behold me then haled before this swift and bloody judgment @-@ bar , where
the best protection was to have no protection , and all resources of
ingenuity became null if they were not founded on truth . Two of my
guards held me each by a hand , the third by the collar of my coat . &quot; Your
name , your profession ? &quot; said the President . &quot; The smallest lie ruins
you , &quot; added one of the judges , -- &quot; My name is Jourgniac Saint @-@ Meard ; I
have served , as an officer , twenty years : and I appear at your tribunal
with the assurance of an innocent man , who therefore will not
lie . &quot; -- &quot; We shall see that , &quot; said the President : &quot; Do you know why you
are arrested ? &quot; -- &quot; Yes , Monsieur le President ; I am accused of editing the
Journal De la Cour et de la Ville . But I hope to prove the falsity &quot; &apos; --

But no ; Jourgniac &apos;s proof of the falsity , and defence generally , though
of excellent result as a defence , is not interesting to read . It is
long @-@ winded ; there is a loose theatricality in the reporting of it ,
which does not amount to unveracity , yet which tends that way . We shall
suppose him successful , beyond hope , in proving and disproving ; and skip
largely , -- to the catastrophe , almost at two steps .

&apos; &quot; But after all , &quot; said one of the Judges , &quot; there is no smoke without
kindling ; tell us why they accuse you of that . &quot; -- &quot; I was about to do
so &quot; &apos; -- Jourgniac does so ; with more and more success .

&apos; &quot; Nay , &quot; continued I , &quot; they accuse me even of recruiting for the
Emigrants ! &quot; At these words there arose a general murmur . &quot; O Messieurs ,
Messieurs , &quot; I exclaimed , raising my voice , &quot; it is my turn to speak ; I
beg M. le President to have the kindness to maintain it for me ; I never
needed it more . &quot; -- &quot; True enough , true enough , &quot; said almost all the judges
with a laugh : &quot; Silence ! &quot;

&apos;While they were examining the testimonials I had produced , a new
Prisoner was brought in , and placed before the President . &quot; It was one
Priest more , &quot; they said , &quot; whom they had ferreted out of the Chapelle . &quot;
After very few questions : &quot; A la Force ! &quot; He flung his breviary on
the table : was hurled forth , and massacred . I reappeared before the
tribunal .

&apos; &quot; You tell us always , &quot; cried one of the judges , with a tone of
impatience , &quot; that you are not this , that you are not that : what are you
then ? &quot; -- &quot; I was an open Royalist . &quot; -- There arose a general murmur ; which
was miraculously appeased by another of the men , who had seemed to take
an interest in me : &quot; We are not here to judge opinions , &quot; said he , &quot; but
to judge the results of them . &quot; Could Rousseau and Voltaire both in one ,
pleading for me , have said better ? -- &quot; Yes , Messieurs , &quot; cried I , &quot; always
till the Tenth of August , I was an open Royalist . Ever since the Tenth
of August that cause has been finished . I am a Frenchman , true to my
country . I was always a man of honour . &quot;

&apos; &quot; My soldiers never distrusted me . Nay , two days before that business
of Nanci , when their suspicion of their officers was at its height ,
they chose me for commander , to lead them to Luneville , to get back the
prisoners of the Regiment Mestre @-@ de @-@ Camp , and seize General Malseigne . &quot; &apos;
Which fact there is , most luckily , an individual present who by a
certain token can confirm .

&apos;The President , this cross @-@ questioning being over , took off his hat and
said : &quot; I see nothing to suspect in this man ; I am for granting him his
liberty . Is that your vote ? &quot; To which all the judges answered : &quot; Oui ,
oui ; it is just ! &quot; &apos;

And there arose vivats within doors and without ; &apos; escort of three , &apos; amid
shoutings and embracings : thus Jourgniac escaped from jury @-@ trial and the
jaws of death . ( Mon Agonie ( ut supra ) , Hist . Parl. xviii . 128 . ) Maton
and Sicard did , either by trial , and no bill found , lank President Chepy
finding &apos; absolutely nothing ; &apos; or else by evasion , and new favour of
Moton the brave watchmaker , likewise escape ; and were embraced , and wept
over ; weeping in return , as they well might .

Thus they three , in wondrous trilogy , or triple soliloquy ;
uttering simultaneously , through the dread night @-@ watches , their
Night @-@ thoughts , -- grown audible to us ! They Three are become audible : but
the other &apos; Thousand and Eighty @-@ nine , of whom Two Hundred and Two were
Priests , &apos; who also had Night @-@ thoughts , remain inaudible ; choked for ever
in black Death . Heard only of President Chepy and the Man in Grey ! --

The Circular .

But the Constituted Authorities , all this while ? The Legislative
Assembly ; the Six Ministers ; the Townhall ; Santerre with the National
Guard ? -- It is very curious to think what a City is . Theatres , to
the number of some twenty @-@ three , were open every night during these
prodigies : while right @-@ arms here grew weary with slaying , right @-@ arms
there are twiddledeeing on melodious catgut ; at the very instant when
Abbe Sicard was clambering up his second pair of shoulders , three @-@ men
high , five hundred thousand human individuals were lying horizontal , as
if nothing were amiss .

As for the poor Legislative , the sceptre had departed from it . The
Legislative did send Deputation to the Prisons , to the Street @-@ Courts ;
and poor M. Dusaulx did harangue there ; but produced no conviction
whatsoever : nay , at last , as he continued haranguing , the Street @-@ Court
interposed , not without threats ; and he had to cease , and withdraw . This
is the same poor worthy old M. Dusaulx who told , or indeed almost
sang ( though with cracked voice ) , the Taking of the Bastille , -- to our
satisfaction long since . He was wont to announce himself , on such and
on all occasions , as the Translator of Juvenal . &quot; Good Citizens , you
see before you a man who loves his country , who is the Translator of
Juvenal , &quot; said he once . -- &quot; Juvenal ? &quot; interrupts Sansculottism : &quot; who the
devil is Juvenal ? One of your sacres Aristocrates ? To the Lanterne ! &quot;
From an orator of this kind , conviction was not to be expected . The
Legislative had much ado to save one of its own Members , or
Ex @-@ Members , Deputy Journeau , who chanced to be lying in arrest for mere
Parliamentary delinquencies , in these Prisons . As for poor old Dusaulx
and Company , they returned to the Salle de Manege , saying , &quot; It was dark ;
and they could not see well what was going on . &quot; ( Moniteur , Debate of 2nd
September , 1792 . )

Roland writes indignant messages , in the name of Order , Humanity , and
the Law ; but there is no Force at his disposal . Santerre &apos;s National
Force seems lazy to rise ; though he made requisitions , he says , -- which
always dispersed again . Nay did not we , with Advocate Maton &apos;s eyes ,
see &apos; men in uniform , &apos; too , with their &apos; sleeves bloody to the shoulder ? &apos;
Petion goes in tricolor scarf ; speaks &quot; the austere language of the
law : &quot; the killers give up , while he is there ; when his back is turned ,
recommence . Manuel too in scarf we , with Maton &apos;s eyes , transiently saw
haranguing , in the Court called of Nurses , Cour des Nourrices . On the
other hand , cruel Billaud , likewise in scarf , &apos; with that small puce coat
and black wig we are used to on him , &apos; ( Mehee , Fils ut supra , in Hist .
Parl. xviii. p . 189 . ) audibly delivers , &apos; standing among corpses , &apos; at
the Abbaye , a short but ever @-@ memorable harangue , reported in various
phraseology , but always to this purpose : &quot; Brave Citizens , you are
extirpating the Enemies of Liberty ; you are at your duty . A grateful
Commune , and Country , would wish to recompense you adequately ; but
cannot , for you know its want of funds . Whoever shall have worked
( travaille ) in a Prison shall receive a draft of one louis , payable
by our cashier . Continue your work . &quot; ( Montgaillard , iii . 191 . ) -- The
Constituted Authorities are of yesterday ; all pulling different ways :
there is properly not Constituted Authority , but every man is his own
King ; and all are kinglets , belligerent , allied , or armed @-@ neutral ,
without king over them .

&apos;O everlasting infamy , &apos; exclaims Montgaillard , &apos; that Paris stood looking
on in stupor for four days , and did not interfere ! &apos; Very desirable
indeed that Paris had interfered ; yet not unnatural that it stood even
so , looking on in stupor . Paris is in death @-@ panic , the enemy and gibbets
at its door : whosoever in Paris has the heart to front death finds it
more pressing to do it fighting the Prussians , than fighting the killers
of Aristocrats . Indignant abhorrence , as in Roland , may be here ; gloomy
sanction , premeditation or not , as in Marat and Committee of Salvation ,
may be there ; dull disapproval , dull approval , and acquiescence in
Necessity and Destiny , is the general temper . The Sons of Darkness , &apos; two
hundred or so , &apos; risen from their lurking @-@ places , have scope to do
their work . Urged on by fever @-@ frenzy of Patriotism , and the madness of
Terror ; -- urged on by lucre , and the gold louis of wages ? Nay , not lucre :
for the gold watches , rings , money of the Massacred , are punctually
brought to the Townhall , by Killers sans @-@ indispensables , who higgle
afterwards for their twenty shillings of wages ; and Sergent sticking an
uncommonly fine agate on his finger ( &apos; fully meaning to account for it &apos; ) ,
becomes Agate @-@ Sergent . But the temper , as we say , is dull acquiescence .
Not till the Patriotic or Frenetic part of the work is finished for want
of material ; and Sons of Darkness , bent clearly on lucre alone , begin
wrenching watches and purses , brooches from ladies &apos; necks &apos; to equip
volunteers , &apos; in daylight , on the streets , -- does the temper from dull
grow vehement ; does the Constable raise his truncheon , and striking
heartily ( like a cattle @-@ driver in earnest ) beat the &apos; course of things&apos;
back into its old regulated drove @-@ roads . The Garde @-@ Meuble itself was
surreptitiously plundered , on the 17th of the Month , to Roland &apos;s new
horror ; who anew bestirs himself , and is , as Sieyes says , &apos; the veto of
scoundrels , &apos; Roland veto des coquins . ( Helen Maria Williams , iii . 27 . ) --

This is the September Massacre , otherwise called &apos; Severe Justice of the
People . &apos; These are the Septemberers ( Septembriseurs ) ; a name of some
note and lucency , -- but lucency of the Nether @-@ fire sort ; very different
from that of our Bastille Heroes , who shone , disputable by no Friend of
Freedom , as in heavenly light @-@ radiance : to such phasis of the business
have we advanced since then ! The numbers massacred are , in Historical
fantasy , &apos; between two and three thousand ; &apos; or indeed they are &apos; upwards
of six thousand , &apos; for Peltier ( in vision ) saw them massacring the very
patients of the Bicetre Madhouse &apos; with grape @-@ shot ; &apos; nay finally they
are &apos; twelve thousand &apos; and odd hundreds , -- not more than that . ( See Hist .
Parl. xvii . 421 , 422 . ) In Arithmetical ciphers , and Lists drawn up
by accurate Advocate Maton , the number , including two hundred and
two priests , three &apos; persons unknown , &apos; and &apos; one thief killed at the
Bernardins , &apos; is , as above hinted , a Thousand and Eighty @-@ nine , -- no less
than that .

A thousand and eighty @-@ nine lie dead , &apos; two hundred and sixty heaped
carcasses on the Pont au Change &apos; itself ; -- among which , Robespierre
pleading afterwards will &apos; nearly weep &apos; to reflect that there was said
to be one slain innocent . ( Moniteur of 6th November , Debate of 5th
November , 1793 . ) One ; not two , O thou seagreen Incorruptible ? If
so , Themis Sansculotte must be lucky ; for she was brief ! -- In the dim
Registers of the Townhall , which are preserved to this day , men read ,
with a certain sickness of heart , items and entries not usual in Town
Books : &apos; To workers employed in preserving the salubrity of the air in
the Prisons , and persons &apos; who presided over these dangerous operations , &apos;
so much , -- in various items , nearly seven hundred pounds sterling . To
carters employed to &apos; the Burying @-@ grounds of Clamart , Montrouge , and
Vaugirard , &apos; at so much a journey , per cart ; this also is an entry . Then
so many francs and odd sous &apos; for the necessary quantity of quick @-@ lime ! &apos;
( Etat des sommes payees par la Commune de Paris , Hist . Parl. xviii .
231 . ) Carts go along the streets ; full of stript human corpses , thrown
pellmell ; limbs sticking up : -- seest thou that cold Hand sticking up ,
through the heaped embrace of brother corpses , in its yellow paleness ,
in its cold rigour ; the palm opened towards Heaven , as if in dumb
prayer , in expostulation de profundis , Take pity on the Sons of
Men ! -- Mercier saw it , as he walked down &apos; the Rue Saint @-@ Jacques from
Montrouge , on the morrow of the Massacres : &apos; but not a Hand ; it was a
Foot , -- which he reckons still more significant , one understands not well
why . Or was it as the Foot of one spurning Heaven ? Rushing , like a wild
diver , in disgust and despair , towards the depths of Annihilation ? Even
there shall His hand find thee , and His right @-@ hand hold thee , -- surely
for right not for wrong , for good not evil ! &apos; I saw that Foot , &apos; says
Mercier ; &apos; I shall know it again at the great Day of Judgment , when
the Eternal , throned on his thunders , shall judge both Kings and
Septemberers . &apos; ( Mercier , Nouveau Paris , vi . 21 . )

That a shriek of inarticulate horror rose over this thing , not only from
French Aristocrats and Moderates , but from all Europe , and has prolonged
itself to the present day , was most natural and right . The thing lay
done , irrevocable ; a thing to be counted besides some other things ,
which lie very black in our Earth &apos;s Annals , yet which will not erase
therefrom . For man , as was remarked , has transcendentalisms in him ;
standing , as he does , poor creature , every way &apos; in the confluence of
Infinitudes ; &apos; a mystery to himself and others : in the centre of two
Eternities , of three Immensities , -- in the intersection of primeval Light
with the everlasting dark ! Thus have there been , especially by vehement
tempers reduced to a state of desperation , very miserable things done .
Sicilian Vespers , and &apos; eight thousand slaughtered in two hours , &apos; are
a known thing . Kings themselves , not in desperation , but only in
difficulty , have sat hatching , for year and day ( nay De Thou says , for
seven years ) , their Bartholomew Business ; and then , at the right moment ,
also on an Autumn Sunday , this very Bell ( they say it is the identical
metal ) of St. Germain l &apos;Auxerrois was set a @-@ pealing -- with effect . ( 9th
to 13th September , 1572 , Dulaure , Hist. de Paris , iv . 289 . ) Nay the same
black boulder @-@ stones of these Paris Prisons have seen Prison @-@ massacres
before now ; men massacring countrymen , Burgundies massacring Armagnacs ,
whom they had suddenly imprisoned , till as now there are piled heaps
of carcasses , and the streets ran red ; -- the Mayor Petion of the time
speaking the austere language of the law , and answered by the Killers ,
in old French ( it is some four hundred years old ) : &quot; Maugre bieu ,
Sire , -- Sir , God &apos;s malison on your justice , your pity , your right
reason . Cursed be of God whoso shall have pity on these false traitorous
Armagnacs , English ; dogs they are ; they have destroyed us , wasted this
realm of France , and sold it to the English . &quot; ( Dulaure , iii . 494 . )
And so they slay , and fling aside the slain , to the extent of &apos; fifteen
hundred and eighteen , among whom are found four Bishops of false and
damnable counsel , and two Presidents of Parlement . &apos; For though it is
not Satan &apos;s world this that we live in , Satan always has his place in
it ( underground properly ) ; and from time to time bursts up . Well may
mankind shriek , inarticulately anathematising as they can . There are
actions of such emphasis that no shrieking can be too emphatic for them .
Shriek ye ; acted have they .

Shriek who might in this France , in this Paris Legislative or Paris
Townhall , there are Ten Men who do not shriek . A Circular goes out from
the Committee of Salut Public , dated 3rd of September 1792 ; directed to
all Townhalls : a State @-@ paper too remarkable to be overlooked . &apos; A part of
the ferocious conspirators detained in the Prisons , &apos; it says , &apos; have been
put to death by the People ; and it , &apos; the Circular , &apos; cannot doubt but
the whole Nation , driven to the edge of ruin by such endless series of
treasons , will make haste to adopt this means of public salvation ; and
all Frenchmen will cry as the men of Paris : We go to fight the enemy ,
but we will not leave robbers behind us , to butcher our wives and
children . &apos; To which are legibly appended these signatures : Panis ,
Sergent ; Marat , Friend of the People ; ( Hist . Parl. xvii . 433 . ) with
Seven others ; -- carried down thereby , in a strange way , to the late
remembrance of Antiquarians . We remark , however , that their Circular
rather recoiled on themselves . The Townhalls made no use of it ; even the
distracted Sansculottes made little ; they only howled and bellowed ,
but did not bite . At Rheims &apos; about eight persons &apos; were killed ; and two
afterwards were hanged for doing it . At Lyons , and a few other places ,
some attempt was made ; but with hardly any effect , being quickly put
down .

Less fortunate were the Prisoners of Orleans ; was the good Duke de la
Rochefoucault . He journeying , by quick stages , with his Mother and Wife ,
towards the Waters of Forges , or some quieter country , was arrested at
Gisors ; conducted along the streets , amid effervescing multitudes ,
and killed dead &apos; by the stroke of a paving @-@ stone hurled through the
coach @-@ window . &apos; Killed as a once Liberal now Aristocrat ; Protector
of Priests , Suspender of virtuous Petions , and his unfortunate
Hot @-@ grown @-@ cold , detestable to Patriotism . He dies lamented of Europe ;
his blood spattering the cheeks of his old Mother , ninety @-@ three years
old .

As for the Orleans Prisoners , they are State Criminals : Royalist
Ministers , Delessarts , Montmorins ; who have been accumulating on the
High Court of Orleans , ever since that Tribunal was set up . Whom now it
seems good that we should get transferred to our new Paris Court of the
Seventeenth ; which proceeds far quicker . Accordingly hot Fournier from
Martinique , Fournier l &apos;Americain , is off , missioned by Constituted
Authority ; with stanch National Guards , with Lazouski the Pole ;
sparingly provided with road @-@ money . These , through bad quarters , through
difficulties , perils , for Authorities cross each other in this time , -- do
triumphantly bring off the Fifty or Fifty @-@ three Orleans Prisoners ,
towards Paris ; where a swifter Court of the Seventeenth will do justice
on them . ( Ibid. xvii . 434 . ) But lo , at Paris , in the interim , a
still swifter and swiftest Court of the Second , and of September , has
instituted itself : enter not Paris , or that will judge you ! -- What shall
hot Fournier do ? It was his duty , as volunteer Constable , had he been a
perfect character , to guard those men &apos;s lives never so Aristocratic , at
the expense of his own valuable life never so Sansculottic , till
some Constituted Court had disposed of them . But he was an imperfect
character and Constable ; perhaps one of the more imperfect .

Hot Fournier , ordered to turn thither by one Authority , to turn thither
by another Authority , is in a perplexing multiplicity of orders ; but
finally he strikes off for Versailles . His Prisoners fare in tumbrils ,
or open carts , himself and Guards riding and marching around : and at the
last village , the worthy Mayor of Versailles comes to meet him , anxious
that the arrival and locking up were well over . It is Sunday , the
ninth day of the month . Lo , on entering the Avenue of Versailles ,
what multitudes , stirring , swarming in the September sun , under the
dull @-@ green September foliage ; the Four @-@ rowed Avenue all humming and
swarming , as if the Town had emptied itself ! Our tumbrils roll heavily
through the living sea ; the Guards and Fournier making way with ever
more difficulty ; the Mayor speaking and gesturing his persuasivest ;
amid the inarticulate growling hum , which growls ever the deeper even by
hearing itself growl , not without sharp yelpings here and there : -- Would
to God we were out of this strait place , and wind and separation had
cooled the heat , which seems about igniting here !

And yet if the wide Avenue is too strait , what will the Street de
Surintendance be , at leaving of the same ? At the corner of Surintendance
Street , the compressed yelpings became a continuous yell : savage figures
spring on the tumbril @-@ shafts ; first spray of an endless coming tide ! The
Mayor pleads , pushes , half @-@ desperate ; is pushed , carried off in men &apos;s
arms : the savage tide has entrance , has mastery . Amid horrid noise , and
tumult as of fierce wolves , the Prisoners sink massacred , -- all but some
eleven , who escaped into houses , and found mercy . The Prisons , and
what other Prisoners they held , were with difficulty saved . The stript
clothes are burnt in bonfire ; the corpses lie heaped in the ditch on
the morrow morning . ( Pieces officielles relatives au massacre des
Prisonniers a Versailles in Hist . Parl. xviii . 236 @-@ 249 . ) All France ,
except it be the Ten Men of the Circular and their people , moans and
rages , inarticulately shrieking ; all Europe rings .

But neither did Danton shriek ; though , as Minister of Justice , it was
more his part to do so . Brawny Danton is in the breach , as of stormed
Cities and Nations ; amid the Sweep of Tenth @-@ of @-@ August cannon , the rustle
of Prussian gallows @-@ ropes , the smiting of September sabres ; destruction
all round him , and the rushing @-@ down of worlds : Minister of Justice
is his name ; but Titan of the Forlorn Hope , and Enfant Perdu of the
Revolution , is his quality , -- and the man acts according to that . &quot; We
must put our enemies in fear ! &quot; Deep fear , is it not , as of its own
accord , falling on our enemies ? The Titan of the Forlorn Hope , he is not
the man that would swiftest of all prevent its so falling . Forward ,
thou lost Titan of an Enfant Perdu ; thou must dare , and again dare , and
without end dare ; there is nothing left for thee but that ! &quot; Que mon nom
soit fletri , Let my name be blighted : &quot; what am I ? The Cause alone is
great ; and shall live , and not perish . -- So , on the whole , here too is a
swallower of Formulas ; of still wider gulp than Mirabeau : this Danton ,
Mirabeau of the Sansculottes . In the September days , this Minister was
not heard of as co @-@ operating with strict Roland ; his business might lie
elsewhere , -- with Brunswick and the Hotel @-@ de @-@ Ville . When applied to by an
official person , about the Orleans Prisoners , and the risks they ran ,
he answered gloomily , twice over , &quot; Are not these men guilty ? &quot; -- When
pressed , he &apos; answered in a terrible voice , &apos; and turned his back .
( Biographie des Ministres , p . 97 . ) Two Thousand slain in the Prisons ;
horrible if you will : but Brunswick is within a day &apos;s journey of us ;
and there are Five @-@ and twenty Millions yet , to slay or to save . Some
men have tasks , -- frightfuller than ours ! It seems strange , but is not
strange , that this Minister of Moloch @-@ Justice , when any suppliant for a
friend &apos;s life got access to him , was found to have human compassion ; and
yielded and granted &apos; always ; &apos; &apos; neither did one personal enemy of Danton
perish in these days . &apos; ( Ibid. p . 103 . )

To shriek , we say , when certain things are acted , is proper and
unavoidable . Nevertheless , articulate speech , not shrieking , is the
faculty of man : when speech is not yet possible , let there be , with
the shortest delay , at least -- silence . Silence , accordingly , in this
forty @-@ fourth year of the business , and eighteen hundred and thirty @-@ sixth
of an &apos; Era called Christian as lucus a non , &apos; is the thing we recommend
and practise . Nay , instead of shrieking more , it were perhaps edifying
to remark , on the other side , what a singular thing Customs ( in Latin ,
Mores ) are ; and how fitly the Virtue , Vir @-@ tus , Manhood or Worth , that is
in a man , is called his Morality , or Customariness . Fell Slaughter ,
one the most authentic products of the Pit you would say , once give
it Customs , becomes War , with Laws of War ; and is Customary and Moral
enough ; and red individuals carry the tools of it girt round their
haunches , not without an air of pride , -- which do thou nowise blame .
While , see ! so long as it is but dressed in hodden or russet ; and
Revolution , less frequent than War , has not yet got its Laws of
Revolution , but the hodden or russet individuals are Uncustomary -- O
shrieking beloved brother blockheads of Mankind , let us close those wide
mouths of ours ; let us cease shrieking , and begin considering !



Chapter 3.1.VII.

September in Argonne .

Plain , at any rate , is one thing : that the fear , whatever of fear those
Aristocrat enemies might need , has been brought about . The matter is
getting serious then ! Sansculottism too has become a Fact , and seems
minded to assert itself as such ? This huge mooncalf of Sansculottism ,
staggering about , as young calves do , is not mockable only , and soft
like another calf ; but terrible too , if you prick it ; and , through its
hideous nostrils , blows fire ! -- Aristocrats , with pale panic in their
hearts , fly towards covert ; and a light rises to them over several
things ; or rather a confused transition towards light , whereby for the
moment darkness is only darker than ever . But , What will become of
this France ? Here is a question ! France is dancing its desert @-@ waltz , as
Sahara does when the winds waken ; in whirlblasts twenty @-@ five millions
in number ; waltzing towards Townhalls , Aristocrat Prisons , and Election
Committee @-@ rooms ; towards Brunswick and the Frontiers ; -- towards a
New Chapter of Universal History ; if indeed it be not the Finis , and
winding @-@ up of that !

In Election Committee @-@ rooms there is now no dubiety ; but the work goes
bravely along . The Convention is getting chosen , -- really in a decisive
spirit ; in the Townhall we already date First year of the Republic .
Some Two hundred of our best Legislators may be re @-@ elected , the Mountain
bodily : Robespierre , with Mayor Petion , Buzot , Curate Gregoire , Rabaut ,
some three score Old @-@ Constituents ; though we once had only &apos; thirty
voices . &apos; All these ; and along with them , friends long known to
Revolutionary fame : Camille Desmoulins , though he stutters in speech ;
Manuel , Tallien and Company ; Journalists Gorsas , Carra , Mercier , Louvet
of Faublas ; Clootz Speaker of Mankind ; Collot d &apos;Herbois , tearing a
passion to rags ; Fabre d &apos;Eglantine , speculative Pamphleteer ; Legendre
the solid Butcher ; nay Marat , though rural France can hardly believe
it , or even believe that there is a Marat except in print . Of Minister
Danton , who will lay down his Ministry for a Membership , we need
not speak . Paris is fervent ; nor is the Country wanting to itself .
Barbaroux , Rebecqui , and fervid Patriots are coming from Marseilles .
Seven hundred and forty @-@ five men ( or indeed forty @-@ nine , for Avignon now
sends Four ) are gathering : so many are to meet ; not so many are to part !

Attorney Carrier from Aurillac , Ex @-@ Priest Lebon from Arras , these shall
both gain a name . Mountainous Auvergne re @-@ elects her Romme : hardy tiller
of the soil , once Mathematical Professor ; who , unconscious , carries in
petto a remarkable New Calendar , with Messidors , Pluvioses , and such
like ; -- and having given it well forth , shall depart by the death they
call Roman . Sieyes old @-@ Constituent comes ; to make new Constitutions as
many as wanted : for the rest , peering out of his clear cautious eyes ,
he will cower low in many an emergency , and find silence safest . Young
Saint @-@ Just is coming , deputed by Aisne in the North ; more like a Student
than a Senator : not four @-@ and @-@ twenty yet ; who has written Books ; a youth
of slight stature , with mild mellow voice , enthusiast olive @-@ complexion ,
and long dark hair . Feraud , from the far valley D &apos;Aure in the folds of
the Pyrenees , is coming ; an ardent Republican ; doomed to fame , at least
in death .

All manner of Patriot men are coming : Teachers , Husbandmen , Priests
and Ex @-@ Priests , Traders , Doctors ; above all , Talkers , or the
Attorney @-@ species . Man @-@ midwives , as Levasseur of the Sarthe , are not
wanting . Nor Artists : gross David , with the swoln cheek , has long
painted , with genius in a state of convulsion ; and will now legislate .
The swoln cheek , choking his words in the birth , totally disqualifies
him as orator ; but his pencil , his head , his gross hot heart , with
genius in a state of convulsion , will be there . A man bodily and
mentally swoln @-@ cheeked , disproportionate ; flabby @-@ large , instead of
great ; weak withal as in a state of convulsion , not strong in a state of
composure : so let him play his part . Nor are naturalised Benefactors of
the Species forgotten : Priestley , elected by the Orne Department , but
declining : Paine the rebellious Needleman , by the Pas de Calais , who
accepts .

Few Nobles come , and yet not none . Paul Francois Barras , &apos; noble as
the Barrases , old as the rocks of Provence ; &apos; he is one . The reckless ,
shipwrecked man : flung ashore on the coast of the Maldives long ago ,
while sailing and soldiering as Indian Fighter ; flung ashore since then ,
as hungry Parisian Pleasure @-@ hunter and Half @-@ pay , on many a Circe Island ,
with temporary enchantment , temporary conversion into beasthood and
hoghood ; -- the remote Var Department has now sent him hither . A man of
heat and haste ; defective in utterance ; defective indeed in any thing
to utter ; yet not without a certain rapidity of glance , a certain swift
transient courage ; who , in these times , Fortune favouring , may go far .
He is tall , handsome to the eye , &apos; only the complexion a little yellow ; &apos;
but &apos; with a robe of purple with a scarlet cloak and plume of tricolor ,
on occasions of solemnity , &apos; the man will look well . ( Dictionnaire
des Hommes Marquans , para Barras . ) Lepelletier Saint @-@ Fargeau ,
Old @-@ Constituent , is a kind of noble , and of enormous wealth ; he too
has come hither : -- to have the Pain of Death abolished ? Hapless
Ex @-@ Parlementeer ! Nay , among our Sixty Old @-@ Constituents , see Philippe
d &apos;Orleans a Prince of the Blood ! Not now d &apos;Orleans : for , Feudalism being
swept from the world , he demands of his worthy friends the Electors of
Paris , to have a new name of their choosing ; whereupon Procureur
Manuel , like an antithetic literary man , recommends Equality , Egalite . A
Philippe Egalite therefore will sit ; seen of the Earth and Heaven .

Such a Convention is gathering itself together . Mere angry poultry in
moulting season ; whom Brunswick &apos;s grenadiers and cannoneers will
give short account of . Would the weather only mend a little !
( Bertrand @-@ Moleville , Memoires , ii . 225 . )

In vain , O Bertrand ! The weather will not mend a whit : -- nay even if it
did ? Dumouriez Polymetis , though Bertrand knows it not , started from
brief slumber at Sedan , on that morning of the 29th of August ; with
stealthiness , with promptitude , audacity . Some three mornings after
that , Brunswick , opening wide eyes , perceives the Passes of the Argonne
all seized ; blocked with felled trees , fortified with camps ; and that it
is a most shifty swift Dumouriez this , who has outwitted him !

The manoeuvre may cost Brunswick &apos; a loss of three weeks , &apos; very fatal in
these circumstances . A Mountain @-@ wall of forty miles lying between him
and Paris : which he should have preoccupied ; -- which how now to get
possession of ? Also the rain it raineth every day ; and we are in a
hungry Champagne Pouilleuse , a land flowing only with ditch @-@ water . How
to cross this Mountain @-@ wall of the Argonne ; or what in the world to do
with it ? -- there are marchings and wet splashings by steep paths ,
with sackerments and guttural interjections ; forcings of Argonne
Passes , -- which unhappily will not force . Through the woods , volleying
War reverberates , like huge gong @-@ music , or Moloch &apos;s kettledrum , borne
by the echoes ; swoln torrents boil angrily round the foot of rocks ,
floating pale carcasses of men . In vain ! Islettes Village , with
its church @-@ steeple , rises intact in the Mountain @-@ pass , between the
embosoming heights ; your forced marchings and climbings have become
forced slidings , and tumblings back . From the hill @-@ tops thou seest
nothing but dumb crags , and endless wet moaning woods ; the Clermont
Vache ( huge Cow that she is ) disclosing herself ( See Helen Maria
Williams . Letters , iii . 79 @-@ 81 . ) at intervals ; flinging off her
cloud @-@ blanket , and soon taking it on again , drowned in the pouring
Heaven . The Argonne Passes will not force : by must skirt the Argonne ; go
round by the end of it .

But fancy whether the Emigrant Seigneurs have not got their brilliancy
dulled a little ; whether that &apos; Foot Regiment in red @-@ facings with nankeen
trousers &apos; could be in field @-@ day order ! In place of gasconading , a sort
of desperation , and hydrophobia from excess of water , is threatening to
supervene . Young Prince de Ligne , son of that brave literary De Ligne
the Thundergod of Dandies , fell backwards ; shot dead in Grand @-@ Pre ,
the Northmost of the Passes : Brunswick is skirting and rounding ,
laboriously , by the extremity of the South . Four days ; days of a rain as
of Noah , -- without fire , without food ! For fire you cut down green trees ,
and produce smoke ; for food you eat green grapes , and produce colic ,
pestilential dysentery , ( Greek ) . And the Peasants assassinate us , they
do not join us ; shrill women cry shame on us , threaten to draw
their very scissors on us ! O ye hapless dulled @-@ bright Seigneurs ,
and hydrophobic splashed Nankeens ; -- but O , ten times more , ye poor
sackerment @-@ ing ghastly @-@ visaged Hessians and Hulans , fallen on
your backs ; who had no call to die there , except compulsion and
three @-@ halfpence a @-@ day ! Nor has Mrs. Le Blanc of the Golden Arm a good
time of it , in her bower of dripping rushes . Assassinating Peasants are
hanged ; Old @-@ Constituent Honourable members , though of venerable age ,
ride in carts with their hands tied ; these are the woes of war .

Thus they ; sprawling and wriggling , far and wide , on the slopes
and passes of the Argonne ; -- a loss to Brunswick of five @-@ and @-@ twenty
disastrous days . There is wriggling and struggling ; facing , backing , and
right @-@ about facing ; as the positions shift , and the Argonne gets partly
rounded , partly forced : -- but still Dumouriez , force him , round him as
you will , sticks like a rooted fixture on the ground ; fixture with many
hinges ; wheeling now this way , now that ; shewing always new front , in
the most unexpected manner : nowise consenting to take himself away .
Recruits stream up on him : full of heart ; yet rather difficult to
deal with . Behind Grand @-@ Pre , for example , Grand @-@ Pre which is on the
wrong @-@ side of the Argonne , for we are now forced and rounded , -- the full
heart , in one of those wheelings and shewings of new front , did as it
were overset itself , as full hearts are liable to do ; and there rose a
shriek of sauve qui peut , and a death @-@ panic which had nigh ruined all !
So that the General had to come galloping ; and , with thunder @-@ words , with
gesture , stroke of drawn sword even , check and rally , and bring back the
sense of shame ; ( Dumouriez , Memoires , iii . 29 . ) -- nay to seize the first
shriekers and ringleaders ; &apos; shave their heads and eyebrows , &apos; and pack
them forth into the world as a sign . Thus too ( for really the rations
are short , and wet camping with hungry stomach brings bad humour ) there
is like to be mutiny . Whereupon again Dumouriez &apos; arrives at the head of
their line , with his staff , and an escort of a hundred huzzars . He had
placed some squadrons behind them , the artillery in front ; he said to
them : &quot; As for you , for I will neither call you citizens , nor soldiers ,
nor my men ( ni mes enfans ) , you see before you this artillery , behind
you this cavalry . You have dishonoured yourselves by crimes . If you
amend , and grow to behave like this brave Army which you have the honour
of belonging to , you will find in me a good father . But plunderers and
assassins I do not suffer here . At the smallest mutiny I will have you
shivered in pieces ( hacher en pieces ) . Seek out the scoundrels that
are among you , and dismiss them yourselves ; I hold you responsible for
them . &quot; &apos; ( Ibid . , Memoires iii . 55 . )

Patience , O Dumouriez ! This uncertain heap of shriekers , mutineers , were
they once drilled and inured , will become a phalanxed mass of Fighters ;
and wheel and whirl , to order , swiftly like the wind or the whirlwind :
tanned mustachio @-@ figures ; often barefoot , even bare @-@ backed ; with sinews
of iron ; who require only bread and gunpowder : very Sons of Fire , the
adroitest , hastiest , hottest ever seen perhaps since Attila &apos;s time . They
may conquer and overrun amazingly , much as that same Attila did ; -- whose
Attila &apos;s @-@ Camp and Battlefield thou now seest , on this very ground ;
( Helen Maria Williams , iii . 32 . ) who , after sweeping bare the world ,
was , with difficulty , and days of tough fighting , checked here by
Roman Aetius and Fortune ; and his dust @-@ cloud made to vanish in the East
again ! --

Strangely enough , in this shrieking Confusion of a Soldiery , which
we saw long since fallen all suicidally out of square in suicidal
collision , -- at Nanci , or on the streets of Metz , where brave Bouille
stood with drawn sword ; and which has collided and ground itself to
pieces worse and worse ever since , down now to such a state : in this
shrieking Confusion , and not elsewhere , lies the first germ of returning
Order for France ! Round which , we say , poor France nearly all ground
down suicidally likewise into rubbish and Chaos , will be glad to rally ;
to begin growing , and new @-@ shaping her inorganic dust : very slowly ,
through centuries , through Napoleons , Louis Philippes , and other the
like media and phases , -- into a new , infinitely preferable France , we can
hope ! --

These wheelings and movements in the region of the Argonne , which are
all faithfully described by Dumouriez himself , and more interesting to
us than Hoyle &apos;s or Philidor &apos;s best Game of Chess , let us , nevertheless ,
O Reader , entirely omit ; -- and hasten to remark two things : the first
a minute private , the second a large public thing . Our minute private
thing is : the presence , in the Prussian host , in that war @-@ game of the
Argonne , of a certain Man , belonging to the sort called Immortal ;
who , in days since then , is becoming visible more and more , in that
character , as the Transitory more and more vanishes ; for from of old
it was remarked that when the Gods appear among men , it is seldom in
recognisable shape ; thus Admetus &apos; neatherds give Apollo a draught of
their goatskin whey @-@ bottle ( well if they do not give him strokes with
their ox @-@ rungs ) , not dreaming that he is the Sungod ! This man &apos;s name is
Johann Wolfgang von Goethe . He is Herzog Weimar &apos;s Minister , come with
the small contingent of Weimar ; to do insignificant unmilitary duty
here ; very irrecognizable to nearly all ! He stands at present , with
drawn bridle , on the height near Saint @-@ Menehould , making an experiment
on the &apos; cannon @-@ fever ; &apos; having ridden thither against persuasion , into
the dance and firing of the cannon @-@ balls , with a scientific desire to
understand what that same cannon @-@ fever may be : &apos; The sound of them , &apos; says
he , &apos; is curious enough ; as if it were compounded of the humming of tops ,
the gurgling of water and the whistle of birds . By degrees you get a
very uncommon sensation ; which can only be described by similitude . It
seems as if you were in some place extremely hot , and at the same time
were completely penetrated by the heat of it ; so that you feel as if you
and this element you are in were perfectly on a par . The eyesight loses
nothing of its strength or distinctness ; and yet it is as if all things
had got a kind of brown @-@ red colour , which makes the situation and the
objects still more impressive on you . &apos; ( Goethe , Campagne in Frankreich ,
Werke , xxx . 73 . )

This is the cannon @-@ fever , as a World @-@ Poet feels it . -- A man entirely
irrecognisable ! In whose irrecognisable head , meanwhile , there verily
is the spiritual counterpart ( and call it complement ) of this same huge
Death @-@ Birth of the World ; which now effectuates itself , outwardly in the
Argonne , in such cannon @-@ thunder ; inwardly , in the irrecognisable
head , quite otherwise than by thunder ! Mark that man , O Reader , as the
memorablest of all the memorable in this Argonne Campaign . What we say
of him is not dream , nor flourish of rhetoric ; but scientific historic
fact ; as many men , now at this distance , see or begin to see .

But the large public thing we had to remark is this : That the Twentieth
of September , 1792 , was a raw morning covered with mist ; that from three
in the morning Sainte @-@ Menehould , and those Villages and homesteads
we know of old were stirred by the rumble of artillery @-@ wagons , by the
clatter of hoofs , and many footed tramp of men : all manner of military ,
Patriot and Prussian , taking up positions , on the Heights of La Lune
and other Heights ; shifting and shoving , -- seemingly in some dread
chess @-@ game ; which may the Heavens turn to good ! The Miller of Valmy has
fled dusty under ground ; his Mill , were it never so windy , will
have rest to @-@ day . At seven in the morning the mist clears off : see
Kellermann , Dumouriez &apos; second in command , with &apos; eighteen pieces of
cannon , &apos; and deep @-@ serried ranks , drawn up round that same silent
Windmill , on his knoll of strength ; Brunswick , also , with serried ranks
and cannon , glooming over to him from the height of La Lune ; only the
little brook and its little dell now parting them .

So that the much @-@ longed @-@ for has come at last ! Instead of hunger and
dysentery , we shall have sharp shot ; and then ! -- Dumouriez , with force
and firm front , looks on from a neighbouring height ; can help only with
his wishes , in silence . Lo , the eighteen pieces do bluster and bark ,
responsive to the bluster of La Lune ; and thunder @-@ clouds mount into the
air ; and echoes roar through all dells , far into the depths of Argonne
Wood ( deserted now ) ; and limbs and lives of men fly dissipated , this
way and that . Can Brunswick make an impression on them ? The dull @-@ bright
Seigneurs stand biting their thumbs : these Sansculottes seem not to fly
like poultry ! Towards noontide a cannon @-@ shot blows Kellermann &apos;s horse
from under him ; there bursts a powder @-@ cart high into the air , with knell
heard over all : some swagging and swaying observable ; -- Brunswick will
try ! &quot; Camarades , &quot; cries Kellermann , &quot; Vive la Patria ! Allons vaincre pour
elle , Let us conquer . &quot; &quot; Live the Fatherland ! &quot; rings responsive , to the
welkin , like rolling @-@ fire from side to side : our ranks are as firm as
rocks ; and Brunswick may recross the dell , ineffectual ; regain his old
position on La Lune ; not unbattered by the way . And so , for the length
of a September day , -- with bluster and bark ; with bellow far echoing ! The
cannonade lasts till sunset ; and no impression made . Till an hour after
sunset , the few remaining Clocks of the District striking Seven ; at this
late time of day Brunswick tries again . With not a whit better fortune !
He is met by rock @-@ ranks , by shouts of Vive la Patrie ; and driven back ,
not unbattered . Whereupon he ceases ; retires &apos; to the Tavern of La Lune ; &apos;
and sets to raising a redoute lest he be attacked !

Verily so : ye dulled @-@ bright Seigneurs , make of it what ye may . Ah , and
France does not rise round us in mass ; and the Peasants do not join us ,
but assassinate us : neither hanging nor any persuasion will induce
them ! They have lost their old distinguishing love of King , and
King &apos;s @-@ cloak , -- I fear , altogether ; and will even fight to be rid of it :
that seems now their humour . Nor does Austria prosper , nor the siege
of Thionville . The Thionvillers , carrying their insolence to the
epigrammatic pitch , have put a Wooden Horse on their walls , with a
bundle of hay hung from him , and this Inscription : &apos; When I finish my
hay , you will take Thionville . &apos; ( Hist . Parl. xix . 177 . ) To such height
has the frenzy of mankind risen .

The trenches of Thionville may shut : and what though those of Lille
open ? The Earth smiles not on us , nor the Heaven ; but weeps and blears
itself , in sour rain , and worse . Our very friends insult us ; we are
wounded in the house of our friends : &quot; His Majesty of Prussia had a
greatcoat , when the rain came ; and ( contrary to all known laws ) he put
it on , though our two French Princes , the hope of their country , had
none ! &quot; To which indeed , as Goethe admits , what answer could be made ?
( Goethe , xxx . 49 . ) -- Cold and Hunger and Affront , Colic and Dysentery
and Death ; and we here , cowering redouted , most unredoubtable , amid the
&apos;tattered corn @-@ shocks and deformed stubble , &apos; on the splashy Height of La
Lune , round the mean Tavern de La Lune ! --

This is the Cannonade of Valmy ; wherein the World @-@ Poet experimented
on the cannon @-@ fever ; wherein the French Sansculottes did not fly like
poultry . Precious to France ! Every soldier did his duty , and Alsatian
Kellermann ( how preferable to old Luckner the dismissed ! ) began to
become greater ; and Egalite Fils , Equality Junior , a light gallant
Field @-@ Officer , distinguished himself by intrepidity : -- it is the same
intrepid individual who now , as Louis @-@ Philippe , without the Equality ,
struggles , under sad circumstances , to be called King of the French for
a season .



Chapter 3.1.VIII.

Exeunt .

But this Twentieth of September is otherwise a great day . For , observe ,
while Kellermann &apos;s horse was flying blown from under him at the Mill of
Valmy , our new National Deputies , that shall be a NATIONAL CONVENTION ,
are hovering and gathering about the Hall of the Hundred Swiss ; with
intent to constitute themselves !

On the morrow , about noontide , Camus the Archivist is busy &apos; verifying
their powers ; &apos; several hundreds of them already here . Whereupon the Old
Legislative comes solemnly over , to merge its old ashes Phoenix @-@ like in
the body of the new ; -- and so forthwith , returning all solemnly back to
the Salle de Manege , there sits a National Convention , Seven Hundred
and Forty @-@ nine complete , or complete enough ; presided by Petion ; -- which
proceeds directly to do business . Read that reported afternoon &apos;s @-@ debate ,
O Reader ; there are few debates like it : dull reporting Moniteur itself
becomes more dramatic than a very Shakespeare . For epigrammatic Manuel
rises , speaks strange things ; how the President shall have a guard of
honour , and lodge in the Tuileries : -- rejected . And Danton rises and
speaks ; and Collot d &apos;Herbois rises , and Curate Gregoire , and lame
Couthon of the Mountain rises ; and in rapid Meliboean stanzas , only a
few lines each , they propose motions not a few : That the corner @-@ stone of
our new Constitution is Sovereignty of the People ; that our Constitution
shall be accepted by the People or be null ; further that the People
ought to be avenged , and have right Judges ; that the Imposts must
continue till new order ; that Landed and other Property be sacred
forever ; finally that &apos; Royalty from this day is abolished in
France : &apos; -- Decreed all , before four o &apos;clock strike , with acclamation of
the world ! ( Hist . Parl. xix . 19 . ) The tree was all so ripe ; only shake
it and there fall such yellow cart @-@ loads .

And so over in the Valmy Region , as soon as the news come , what stir
is this , audible , visible from our muddy heights of La Lune ? ( Williams ,
iii . 71 . ) Universal shouting of the French on their opposite hillside ;
caps raised on bayonets ; and a sound as of Republique ; Vive la
Republique borne dubious on the winds ! -- On the morrow morning , so to
speak , Brunswick slings his knapsacks before day , lights any fires he
has ; and marches without tap of drum . Dumouriez finds ghastly symptoms
in that camp ; &apos; latrines full of blood ! &apos; ( 1st October , 1792 ; Dumouriez ,
iii . 73 . ) The chivalrous King of Prussia , for he as we saw is here
in person , may long rue the day ; may look colder than ever on these
dulled @-@ bright Seigneurs , and French Princes their Country &apos;s hope ; -- and ,
on the whole , put on his great @-@ coat without ceremony , happy that he
has one . They retire , all retire with convenient despatch , through a
Champagne trodden into a quagmire , the wild weather pouring on them ;
Dumouriez through his Kellermanns and Dillons pricking them a little in
the hinder parts . A little , not much ; now pricking , now negotiating : for
Brunswick has his eyes opened ; and the Majesty of Prussia is a repentant
Majesty .

Nor has Austria prospered , nor the Wooden Horse of Thionville bitten his
hay ; nor Lille City surrendered itself . The Lille trenches opened , on
the 29th of the month ; with balls and shells , and redhot balls ; as if
not trenches but Vesuvius and the Pit had opened . It was frightful , say
all eye @-@ witnesses ; but it is ineffectual . The Lillers have risen to such
temper ; especially after these news from Argonne and the East . Not a
Sans @-@ indispensables in Lille that would surrender for a King &apos;s ransom .
Redhot balls rain , day and night ; &apos; six @-@ thousand , &apos; or so , and bombs
&apos;filled internally with oil of turpentine which splashes up in
flame ; &apos; -- mainly on the dwellings of the Sansculottes and Poor ; the
streets of the Rich being spared . But the Sansculottes get water @-@ pails ;
form quenching @-@ regulations , &quot; The ball is in Peter &apos;s house ! &quot; &quot; The ball
is in John &apos;s ! &quot; They divide their lodging and substance with each other ;
shout Vive la Republique ; and faint not in heart . A ball thunders
through the main chamber of the Hotel @-@ de @-@ Ville , while the Commune is
there assembled : &quot; We are in permanence , &quot; says one , coldly , proceeding
with his business ; and the ball remains permanent too , sticking in the
wall , probably to this day . ( Bombardement de Lille in Hist . Parl. xx .
63 @-@ 71 . )

The Austrian Archduchess ( Queen &apos;s Sister ) will herself see red artillery
fired ; in their over @-@ haste to satisfy an Archduchess &apos; two mortars
explode and kill thirty persons . &apos; It is in vain ; Lille , often burning ,
is always quenched again ; Lille will not yield . The very boys deftly
wrench the matches out of fallen bombs : &apos; a man clutches a rolling ball
with his hat , which takes fire ; when cool , they crown it with a bonnet
rouge . &apos; Memorable also be that nimble Barber , who when the bomb burst
beside him , snatched up a shred of it , introduced soap and lather into
it , crying , &quot; Voila mon plat a barbe , My new shaving @-@ dish ! &quot; and shaved
&apos;fourteen people &apos; on the spot . Bravo , thou nimble Shaver ; worthy to
shave old spectral Redcloak , and find treasures ! -- On the eighth day
of this desperate siege , the sixth day of October , Austria finding
it fruitless , draws off , with no pleasurable consciousness ; rapidly ,
Dumouriez tending thitherward ; and Lille too , black with ashes and
smoulder , but jubilant skyhigh , flings its gates open . The Plat a
barbe became fashionable ; &apos; no Patriot of an elegant turn , &apos; says Mercier
several years afterwards , &apos; but shaves himself out of the splinter of a
Lille bomb . &apos; 

Quid multa , Why many words ? The Invaders are in flight ; Brunswick &apos;s
Host , the third part of it gone to death , staggers disastrous along the
deep highways of Champagne ; spreading out also into &apos; the fields , of a
tough spongy red @-@ coloured clay ; -- like Pharaoh through a Red Sea of
mud , &apos; says Goethe ; &apos; for he also lay broken chariots , and riders and
foot seemed sinking around . &apos; ( Campagne in Frankreich , p . 103 . ) On the
eleventh morning of October , the World @-@ Poet , struggling Northwards out
of Verdun , which he had entered Southwards , some five weeks ago , in
quite other order , discerned the following Phenomenon and formed part of
it :

&apos;Towards three in the morning , without having had any sleep , we were
about mounting our carriage , drawn up at the door ; when an insuperable
obstacle disclosed itself : for there rolled on already , between the
pavement @-@ stones which were crushed up into a ridge on each side , an
uninterrupted column of sick @-@ wagons through the Town , and all was
trodden as into a morass . While we stood waiting what could be made
of it , our Landlord the Knight of Saint @-@ Louis pressed past us , without
salutation . &apos; He had been a Calonne &apos;s Notable in 1787 , an Emigrant since ;
had returned to his home , jubilant , with the Prussians ; but must now
forth again into the wide world , &apos; followed by a servant carrying a
little bundle on his stick .

&apos;The activity of our alert Lisieux shone eminent ; and , on this occasion
too , brought us on : for he struck into a small gap of the wagon @-@ row ; and
held the advancing team back till we , with our six and our four horses ,
got intercalated ; after which , in my light little coachlet , I could
breathe freer . We were now under way ; at a funeral pace , but still under
way . The day broke ; we found ourselves at the outlet of the Town , in a
tumult and turmoil without measure . All sorts of vehicles , few horsemen ,
innumerable foot @-@ people , were crossing each other on the great esplanade
before the Gate . We turned to the right , with our Column ,
towards Estain , on a limited highway , with ditches at each side .
Self @-@ preservation , in so monstrous a press , knew now no pity , no
respect of aught . Not far before us there fell down a horse of an
ammunition @-@ wagon : they cut the traces , and let it lie . And now as the
three others could not bring their load along , they cut them also loose ,
tumbled the heavy @-@ packed vehicle into the ditch ; and , with the smallest
retardation , we had to drive on , right over the horse , which was just
about to rise ; and I saw too clearly how its legs , under the wheels ,
went crashing and quivering .

&apos;Horse and foot endeavoured to escape from the narrow laborious highway
into the meadows : but these too were rained to ruin ; overflowed by full
ditches , the connexion of the footpaths every where interrupted . Four
gentlemanlike , handsome , well @-@ dressed French soldiers waded for a time
beside our carriage ; wonderfully clean and neat : and had such art of
picking their steps , that their foot @-@ gear testified no higher than the
ancle to the muddy pilgrimage these good people found themselves engaged
in .

&apos;That under such circumstances one saw , in ditches , in meadows , in
fields and crofts , dead horses enough , was natural to the case : by and
by , however , you found them also flayed , the fleshy parts even cut away ;
sad token of the universal distress .

&apos;Thus we fared on ; every moment in danger , at the smallest stoppage
on our own part , of being ourselves tumbled overboard ; under which
circumstances , truly , the careful dexterity of our Lisieux could not be
sufficiently praised . The same talent shewed itself at Estain ; where we
arrived towards noon ; and descried , over the beautiful well @-@ built
little Town , through streets and on squares , around and beside us , one
sense @-@ confusing tumult : the mass rolled this way and that ; and , all
struggling forward , each hindered the other . Unexpectedly our carriage
drew up before a stately house in the market @-@ place ; master and mistress
of the mansion saluted us in reverent distance . &apos; Dexterous Lisieux ,
though we knew it not , had said we were the King of Prussia &apos;s Brother !

&apos;But now , from the ground @-@ floor windows , looking over the whole
market @-@ place , we had the endless tumult lying , as it were , palpable . All
sorts of walkers , soldiers in uniform , marauders , stout but sorrowing
citizens and peasants , women and children , crushed and jostled each
other , amid vehicles of all forms : ammunition @-@ wagons , baggage @-@ wagons ;
carriages , single , double , and multiplex ; such hundredfold miscellany
of teams , requisitioned or lawfully owned , making way , hitting together ,
hindering each other , rolled here to right and to left . Horned @-@ cattle
too were struggling on ; probably herds that had been put in requisition .
Riders you saw few ; but the elegant carriages of the Emigrants ,
many @-@ coloured , lackered , gilt and silvered , evidently by the best
builders , caught your eye . ( See Hermann and Dorothea ( also by Goethe ) ,
Buch Kalliope . )

&apos;The crisis of the strait however arose further on a little ; where the
crowded market @-@ place had to introduce itself into a street , -- straight
indeed and good , but proportionably far too narrow . I have , in my life ,
seen nothing like it : the aspect of it might perhaps be compared to that
of a swoln river which has been raging over meadows and fields , and is
now again obliged to press itself through a narrow bridge , and flow
on in its bounded channel . Down the long street , all visible from
our windows , there swelled continually the strangest tide : a high
double @-@ seated travelling @-@ coach towered visible over the flood of things .
We thought of the fair Frenchwomen we had seen in the morning . It was
not they , however , it was Count Haugwitz ; him you could look at , with
a kind of sardonic malice , rocking onwards , step by step , there . &apos; 
( Campagne in Frankreich , Goethe &apos;s Werke ( Stuttgart , 1829 ) , xxx .
133 @-@ 137 . )

In such untriumphant Procession has the Brunswick Manifesto issued ! Nay
in worse , &apos; in Negotiation with these miscreants , &apos; -- the first news of
which produced such a revulsion in the Emigrant nature , as put our
scientific World @-@ Poet &apos; in fear for the wits of several . &apos; There is no
help : they must fare on , these poor Emigrants , angry with all persons
and things , and making all persons angry , in the hapless course they
struck into . Landlord and landlady testify to you , at tables @-@ d &apos;hote , how
insupportable these Frenchmen are : how , in spite of such humiliation ,
of poverty and probable beggary , there is ever the same struggle for
precedence , the same forwardness , and want of discretion . High in
honour , at the head of the table , you with your own eyes observe not
a Seigneur but the automaton of a Seigneur , fallen into dotage ; still
worshipped , reverently waited on , and fed . In miscellaneous seats , is
a miscellany of soldiers , commissaries , adventurers ; consuming silently
their barbarian victuals . &apos; On all brows is to be read a hard destiny ;
all are silent , for each has his own sufferings to bear , and looks forth
into misery without bounds . &apos; One hasty wanderer , coming in , and eating
without ungraciousness what is set before him , the landlord lets off
almost scot @-@ free . &quot; He is , &quot; whispered the landlord to me , &quot; the first of
these cursed people I have seen condescend to taste our German black
bread . &quot; ( Ibid . 152 . ) ( Ibid . 210 @-@ 12 . )

And Dumouriez is in Paris ; lauded and feasted ; paraded in glittering
saloons , floods of beautifullest blond @-@ dresses and broadcloth @-@ coats
flowing past him , endless , in admiring joy . One night , nevertheless , in
the splendour of one such scene , he sees himself suddenly apostrophised
by a squalid unjoyful Figure , who has come in uninvited , nay despite of
all lackeys ; an unjoyful Figure ! The Figure is come &quot; in express mission
from the Jacobins , &quot; to inquire sharply , better then than later , touching
certain things : &quot; Shaven eyebrows of Volunteer Patriots , for instance ? &quot;
Also &quot; your threats of shivering in pieces ? &quot; Also , &quot; why you have not
chased Brunswick hotly enough ? &quot; Thus , with sharp croak , inquires the
Figure . -- &quot; Ah , c &apos;est vous qu &apos;on appelle Marat , You are he they call
Marat ! &quot; answers the General , and turns coldly on his heel . ( Dumouriez ,
iii . 115 . -- Marat &apos;s account , In the Debats des Jacobins and Journal de
la Republique ( Hist . Parl. xix . 317 @-@ 21 ) , agrees to the turning on
the heel , but strives to interpret it differently . ) -- &quot; Marat ! &quot; The
blonde @-@ gowns quiver like aspens ; the dress @-@ coats gather round ; Actor
Talma ( for it is his house ) , and almost the very chandelier @-@ lights , are
blue : till this obscene Spectrum , or visual Appearance , vanish back into
native Night .

General Dumouriez , in few brief days , is gone again , towards the
Netherlands ; will attack the Netherlands , winter though it be . And
General Montesquiou , on the South @-@ East , has driven in the Sardinian
Majesty ; nay , almost without a shot fired , has taken Savoy from him ,
which longs to become a piece of the Republic . And General Custine , on
the North @-@ East , has dashed forth on Spires and its Arsenal ; and then
on Electoral Mentz , not uninvited , wherein are German Democrats and no
shadow of an Elector now : -- so that in the last days of October , Frau
Forster , a daughter of Heyne &apos;s , somewhat democratic , walking out of the
Gate of Mentz with her Husband , finds French Soldiers playing at bowls
with cannon @-@ balls there . Forster trips cheerfully over one iron bomb ,
with &quot; Live the Republic ! &quot; A black @-@ bearded National Guard answers : &quot; Elle
vivra bien sans vous , It will probably live independently of you ! &quot;

Chapter 3.2.I.

The Deliberative .

France therefore has done two things very completely : she has hurled
back her Cimmerian Invaders far over the marches ; and likewise she has
shattered her own internal Social Constitution , even to the minutest
fibre of it , into wreck and dissolution . Utterly it is all altered : from
King down to Parish Constable , all Authorities , Magistrates , Judges ,
persons that bore rule , have had , on the sudden , to alter themselves , so
far as needful ; or else , on the sudden , and not without violence , to
be altered : a Patriot &apos; Executive Council of Ministers , &apos; with a Patriot
Danton in it , and then a whole Nation and National Convention , have
taken care of that . Not a Parish Constable , in the furthest hamlet , who
has said De Par le Roi , and shewn loyalty , but must retire , making way
for a new improved Parish Constable who can say De par la Republique .

It is a change such as History must beg her readers to imagine ,
undescribed . An instantaneous change of the whole body @-@ politic , the
soul @-@ politic being all changed ; such a change as few bodies , politic
or other , can experience in this world . Say perhaps , such as poor Nymph
Semele &apos;s body did experience , when she would needs , with woman &apos;s humour ,
see her Olympian Jove as very Jove ; -- and so stood , poor Nymph , this
moment Semele , next moment not Semele , but Flame and a Statue of red @-@ hot
Ashes ! France has looked upon Democracy ; seen it face to face . -- The
Cimmerian Invaders will rally , in humbler temper , with better or worse
luck : the wreck and dissolution must reshape itself into a social
Arrangement as it can and may . But as for this National Convention ,
which is to settle every thing , if it do , as Deputy Paine and France
generally expects , get all finished &apos; in a few months , &apos; we shall call it
a most deft Convention .

In truth , it is very singular to see how this mercurial French People
plunges suddenly from Vive le Roi to Vive la Republique ; and goes
simmering and dancing ; shaking off daily ( so to speak ) , and trampling
into the dust , its old social garnitures , ways of thinking , rules of
existing ; and cheerfully dances towards the Ruleless , Unknown , with such
hope in its heart , and nothing but Freedom , Equality and Brotherhood
in its mouth . Is it two centuries , or is it only two years , since all
France roared simultaneously to the welkin , bursting forth into sound
and smoke at its Feast of Pikes , &quot; Live the Restorer of French Liberty ? &quot;
Three short years ago there was still Versailles and an Oeil @-@ de @-@ Boeuf :
now there is that watched Circuit of the Temple , girt with dragon @-@ eyed
Municipals , where , as in its final limbo , Royalty lies extinct . In
the year 1789 , Constituent Deputy Barrere &apos; wept , &apos; in his Break @-@ of @-@ Day
Newspaper , at sight of a reconciled King Louis ; and now in 1792,
Convention Deputy Barrere , perfectly tearless , may be considering ,
whether the reconciled King Louis shall be guillotined or not .

Old garnitures and social vestures drop off ( we say ) so fast , being
indeed quite decayed , and are trodden under the National dance . And
the new vestures , where are they ; the new modes and rules ? Liberty ,
Equality , Fraternity : not vestures but the wish for vestures ! The Nation
is for the present , figuratively speaking , naked ! It has no rule or
vesture ; but is naked , -- a Sansculottic Nation .

So far , therefore , in such manner have our Patriot Brissots , Guadets
triumphed . Vergniaud &apos;s Ezekiel @-@ visions of the fall of thrones and
crowns , which he spake hypothetically and prophetically in the Spring of
the year , have suddenly come to fulfilment in the Autumn . Our eloquent
Patriots of the Legislative , like strong Conjurors , by the word of their
mouth , have swept Royalism with its old modes and formulas to the winds ;
and shall now govern a France free of formulas . Free of formulas ! And
yet man lives not except with formulas ; with customs , ways of doing and
living : no text truer than this ; which will hold true from the Tea @-@ table
and Tailor &apos;s shopboard up to the High Senate @-@ houses , Solemn Temples ; nay
through all provinces of Mind and Imagination , onwards to the outmost
confines of articulate Being , -- Ubi homines sunt modi sunt ! There are
modes wherever there are men . It is the deepest law of man &apos;s nature ;
whereby man is a craftsman and &apos; tool @-@ using animal ; &apos; not the slave of
Impulse , Chance , and Brute Nature , but in some measure their lord .
Twenty @-@ five millions of men , suddenly stript bare of their modi , and
dancing them down in that manner , are a terrible thing to govern !

Eloquent Patriots of the Legislative , meanwhile , have precisely this
problem to solve . Under the name and nickname of &apos; statesmen , hommes
d &apos;etat , &apos; of &apos; moderate @-@ men , moderantins , &apos; of Brissotins , Rolandins ,
finally of Girondins , they shall become world @-@ famous in solving it . For
the Twenty @-@ five millions are Gallic effervescent too ; -- filled both with
hope of the unutterable , of universal Fraternity and Golden Age ; and
with terror of the unutterable , Cimmerian Europe all rallying on us . It
is a problem like few . Truly , if man , as the Philosophers brag , did to
any extent look before and after , what , one may ask , in many cases would
become of him ? What , in this case , would become of these Seven Hundred
and Forty @-@ nine men ? The Convention , seeing clearly before and after ,
were a paralysed Convention . Seeing clearly to the length of its own
nose , it is not paralysed .

To the Convention itself neither the work nor the method of doing it is
doubtful : To make the Constitution ; to defend the Republic till that be
made . Speedily enough , accordingly , there has been a &apos; Committee of
the Constitution &apos; got together . Sieyes , Old @-@ Constituent ,
Constitution @-@ builder by trade ; Condorcet , fit for better things ; Deputy
Paine , foreign Benefactor of the Species , with that &apos; red
carbuncled face , and the black beaming eyes ; &apos; Herault de Sechelles ,
Ex @-@ Parlementeer , one of the handsomest men in France : these , with
inferior guild @-@ brethren , are girt cheerfully to the work ; will once more
&apos;make the Constitution ; &apos; let us hope , more effectually than last time .
For that the Constitution can be made , who doubts , -- unless the Gospel
of Jean Jacques came into the world in vain ? True , our last Constitution
did tumble within the year , so lamentably . But what then , except sort
the rubbish and boulders , and build them up again better ? &apos; Widen your
basis , &apos; for one thing , -- to Universal Suffrage , if need be ; exclude
rotten materials , Royalism and such like , for another thing . And in
brief , build , O unspeakable Sieyes and Company , unwearied ! Frequent
perilous downrushing of scaffolding and rubble @-@ work , be that an
irritation , no discouragement . Start ye always again , clearing aside the
wreck ; if with broken limbs , yet with whole hearts ; and build , we say ,
in the name of Heaven , -- till either the work do stand ; or else mankind
abandon it , and the Constitution @-@ builders be paid off , with laughter and
tears ! One good time , in the course of Eternity , it was appointed that
this of Social Contract too should try itself out . And so the Committee
of Constitution shall toil : with hope and faith ; -- with no disturbance
from any reader of these pages .

To make the Constitution , then , and return home joyfully in a few
months : this is the prophecy our National Convention gives of itself ; by
this scientific program shall its operations and events go on . But from
the best scientific program , in such a case , to the actual fulfilment ,
what a difference ! Every reunion of men , is it not , as we often say ,
a reunion of incalculable Influences ; every unit of it a microcosm of
Influences ; -- of which how shall Science calculate or prophesy ! Science ,
which cannot , with all its calculuses , differential , integral , and of
variations , calculate the Problem of Three gravitating Bodies , ought to
hold her peace here , and say only : In this National Convention there are
Seven Hundred and Forty @-@ nine very singular Bodies , that gravitate and
do much else ; -- who , probably in an amazing manner , will work the
appointment of Heaven .

Of National Assemblages , Parliaments , Congresses , which have long sat ;
which are of saturnine temperament ; above all , which are not &apos; dreadfully
in earnest , &apos; something may be computed or conjectured : yet even these
are a kind of Mystery in progress , -- whereby we see the Journalist
Reporter find livelihood : even these jolt madly out of the ruts , from
time to time . How much more a poor National Convention , of French
vehemence ; urged on at such velocity ; without routine , without rut ,
track or landmark ; and dreadfully in earnest every man of them ! It is
a Parliament literally such as there was never elsewhere in the world .
Themselves are new , unarranged ; they are the Heart and presiding centre
of a France fallen wholly into maddest disarrangement . From all cities ,
hamlets , from the utmost ends of this France with its Twenty @-@ five
million vehement souls , thick @-@ streaming influences storm in on that
same Heart , in the Salle de Manege , and storm out again : such fiery
venous @-@ arterial circulation is the function of that Heart . Seven Hundred
and Forty @-@ nine human individuals , we say , never sat together on Earth ,
under more original circumstances . Common individuals most of them , or
not far from common ; yet in virtue of the position they occupied , so
notable . How , in this wild piping of the whirlwind of human passions ,
with death , victory , terror , valour , and all height and all depth
pealing and piping , these men , left to their own guidance , will speak
and act ?

Readers know well that this French National Convention ( quite contrary
to its own Program ) became the astonishment and horror of mankind ; a
kind of Apocalyptic Convention , or black Dream become real ; concerning
which History seldom speaks except in the way of interjection : how it
covered France with woe , delusion , and delirium ; and from its bosom
there went forth Death on the pale Horse . To hate this poor National
Convention is easy ; to praise and love it has not been found impossible .
It is , as we say , a Parliament in the most original circumstances . To
us , in these pages , be it as a fuliginous fiery mystery , where Upper has
met Nether , and in such alternate glare and blackness of darkness poor
bedazzled mortals know not which is Upper , which is Nether ; but rage
and plunge distractedly , as mortals , in that case , will do . A Convention
which has to consume itself , suicidally ; and become dead ashes -- with its
World ! Behoves us , not to enter exploratively its dim embroiled deeps ;
yet to stand with unwavering eyes , looking how it welters ; what notable
phases and occurrences it will successively throw up .

One general superficial circumstance we remark with praise : the force of
Politeness . To such depth has the sense of civilisation penetrated man &apos;s
life ; no Drouet , no Legendre , in the maddest tug of war , can altogether
shake it off . Debates of Senates dreadfully in earnest are seldom given
frankly to the world ; else perhaps they would surprise it . Did not the
Grand Monarque himself once chase his Louvois with a pair of brandished
tongs ? But reading long volumes of these Convention Debates , all in a
foam with furious earnestness , earnest many times to the extent of
life and death , one is struck rather with the degree of continence they
manifest in speech ; and how in such wild ebullition , there is still a
kind of polite rule struggling for mastery , and the forms of social life
never altogether disappear . These men , though they menace with clenched
right @-@ hands , do not clench one another by the collar ; they draw no
daggers , except for oratorical purposes , and this not often : profane
swearing is almost unknown , though the Reports are frank enough ; we find
only one or two oaths , oaths by Marat , reported in all .

For the rest , that there is &apos; effervescence &apos; who doubts ? Effervescence
enough ; Decrees passed by acclamation to @-@ day , repealed by vociferation
to @-@ morrow ; temper fitful , most rotatory changeful , always headlong ! The
&apos;voice of the orator is covered with rumours ; &apos; a hundred &apos; honourable
Members rush with menaces towards the Left side of the Hall ; &apos; President
has &apos; broken three bells in succession , &apos; -- claps on his hat , as signal
that the country is near ruined . A fiercely effervescent Old @-@ Gallic
Assemblage ! -- Ah , how the loud sick sounds of Debate , and of Life , which
is a debate , sink silent one after another : so loud now , and in a little
while so low ! Brennus , and those antique Gael Captains , in their way
to Rome , to Galatia , and such places , whither they were in the habit of
marching in the most fiery manner , had Debates as effervescent , doubt it
not ; though no Moniteur has reported them . They scolded in Celtic Welsh ,
those Brennuses ; neither were they Sansculotte ; nay rather breeches
( braccae , say of felt or rough @-@ leather ) were the only thing they had ;
being , as Livy testifies , naked down to the haunches : -- and , see , it is
the same sort of work and of men still , now when they have got coats ,
and speak nasally a kind of broken Latin ! But on the whole does not TIME
envelop this present National Convention ; as it did those Brennuses , and
ancient August Senates in felt breeches ? Time surely ; and also Eternity .
Dim dusk of Time , -- or noon which will be dusk ; and then there is night ,
and silence ; and Time with all its sick noises is swallowed in the still
sea . Pity thy brother , O Son of Adam ! The angriest frothy jargon that
he utters , is it not properly the whimpering of an infant which cannot
speak what ails it , but is in distress clearly , in the inwards of it ;
and so must squall and whimper continually , till its Mother take it , and
it get -- to sleep !

This Convention is not four days old , and the melodious Meliboean
stanzas that shook down Royalty are still fresh in our ear , when there
bursts out a new diapason , -- unhappily , of Discord , this time . For speech
has been made of a thing difficult to speak of well : the September
Massacres . How deal with these September Massacres ; with the Paris
Commune that presided over them ? A Paris Commune hateful @-@ terrible ;
before which the poor effete Legislative had to quail , and sit quiet .
And now if a young omnipotent Convention will not so quail and sit , what
steps shall it take ? Have a Departmental Guard in its pay , answer
the Girondins , and Friends of Order ! A Guard of National Volunteers ,
missioned from all the Eighty @-@ three or Eighty @-@ five Departments , for that
express end ; these will keep Septemberers , tumultuous Communes in a due
state of submissiveness , the Convention in a due state of sovereignty .
So have the Friends of Order answered , sitting in Committee , and
reporting ; and even a Decree has been passed of the required tenour . Nay
certain Departments , as the Var or Marseilles , in mere expectation and
assurance of a Decree , have their contingent of Volunteers already on
march : brave Marseillese , foremost on the Tenth of August , will not be
hindmost here ; &apos; fathers gave their sons a musket and twenty @-@ five louis , &apos;
says Barbaroux , &apos; and bade them march . &apos; 

Can any thing be properer ? A Republic that will found itself on justice
must needs investigate September Massacres ; a Convention calling itself
National , ought it not to be guarded by a National force ? -- Alas , Reader ,
it seems so to the eye : and yet there is much to be said and argued .
Thou beholdest here the small beginning of a Controversy , which mere
logic will not settle . Two small well @-@ springs , September , Departmental
Guard , or rather at bottom they are but one and the same small
well @-@ spring ; which will swell and widen into waters of bitterness ; all
manner of subsidiary streams and brooks of bitterness flowing in , from
this side and that ; till it become a wide river of bitterness , of
rage and separation , -- which can subside only into the Catacombs .
This Departmental Guard , decreed by overwhelming majorities , and then
repealed for peace &apos;s sake , and not to insult Paris , is again decreed
more than once ; nay it is partially executed , and the very men that are
to be of it are seen visibly parading the Paris streets , -- shouting once ,
being overtaken with liquor : &quot; A bas Marat , Down with Marat ! &quot; ( Hist .
Parl. xx . 184 . ) Nevertheless , decreed never so often , it is repealed
just as often ; and continues , for some seven months , an angry noisy
Hypothesis only : a fair Possibility struggling to become a Reality , but
which shall never be one ; which , after endless struggling , shall , in
February next , sink into sad rest , -- dragging much along with it . So
singular are the ways of men and honourable Members .

But on this fourth day of the Convention &apos;s existence , as we said , which
is the 25th of September 1792 , there comes Committee Report on that
Decree of the Departmental Guard , and speech of repealing it ; there
come denunciations of anarchy , of a Dictatorship , -- which let the
incorruptible Robespierre consider : there come denunciations of a
certain Journal de la Republique , once called Ami du Peuple ; and so
thereupon there comes , visibly stepping up , visibly standing aloft on
the Tribune , ready to speak , the Bodily Spectrum of People &apos;s @-@ Friend
Marat ! Shriek , ye Seven Hundred and Forty @-@ nine ; it is verily Marat ,
he and not another . Marat is no phantasm of the brain , or mere lying
impress of Printer &apos;s Types ; but a thing material , of joint and sinew ,
and a certain small stature : ye behold him there , in his blackness in
his dingy squalor , a living fraction of Chaos and Old Night ; visibly
incarnate , desirous to speak . &quot; It appears , &quot; says Marat to the shrieking
Assembly , &quot; that a great many persons here are enemies of mine . &quot; &quot; All !
All ! &quot; shriek hundreds of voices : enough to drown any People &apos;s @-@ Friend .
But Marat will not drown : he speaks and croaks explanation ; croaks with
such reasonableness , air of sincerity , that repentant pity smothers
anger , and the shrieks subside or even become applauses . For this
Convention is unfortunately the crankest of machines : it shall be
pointing eastward , with stiff violence , this moment ; and then do but
touch some spring dexterously , the whole machine , clattering and jerking
seven @-@ hundred @-@ fold , will whirl with huge crash , and , next moment , is
pointing westward ! Thus Marat , absolved and applauded , victorious in
this turn of fence , is , as the Debate goes on , prickt at again by
some dexterous Girondin ; and then and shrieks rise anew , and Decree of
Accusation is on the point of passing ; till the dingy People &apos;s @-@ Friend
bobs aloft once more ; croaks once more persuasive stillness , and the
Decree of Accusation sinks , Whereupon he draws forth -- a Pistol ; and
setting it to his Head , the seat of such thought and prophecy , says : &quot; If
they had passed their Accusation Decree , he , the People &apos;s @-@ Friend , would
have blown his brains out . &quot; A People &apos;s Friend has that faculty in
him . For the rest , as to this of the two hundred and sixty thousand
Aristocrat Heads , Marat candidly says , &quot; C &apos;est la mon avis , such is my
opinion . &quot; Also it is not indisputable : &quot; No power on Earth can prevent
me from seeing into traitors , and unmasking them , &quot; -- by my superior
originality of mind ? ( Moniteur Newspaper , Nos. 271 , 280 , 294 , Annee
premiere ; Moore &apos;s Journal , ii . 21 , 157 , &amp; c. which , however , may
perhaps , as in similar cases , be only a copy of the Newspaper . )
An honourable member like this Friend of the People few terrestrial
Parliaments have had .

We observe , however , that this first onslaught by the Friends of Order ,
as sharp and prompt as it was , has failed . For neither can Robespierre ,
summoned out by talk of Dictatorship , and greeted with the like rumour
on shewing himself , be thrown into Prison , into Accusation ; -- not though
Barbarous openly bear testimony against him , and sign it on paper . With
such sanctified meekness does the Incorruptible lift his seagreen cheek
to the smiter ; lift his thin voice , and with jesuitic dexterity plead ,
and prosper : asking at last , in a prosperous manner : &quot; But what witnesses
has the Citoyen Barbaroux to support his testimony ? &quot; &quot; Moi ! &quot; cries
hot Rebecqui , standing up , striking his breast with both hands ,
and answering , &quot; Me ! &quot; ( Moniteur , ut supra ; Seance du 25 Septembre . )
Nevertheless the Seagreen pleads again , and makes it good : the long
hurlyburly , &apos; personal merely , &apos; while so much public matter lies fallow ,
has ended in the order of the day . O Friends of the Gironde , why will
you occupy our august sessions with mere paltry Personalities , while the
grand Nationality lies in such a state ? -- The Gironde has touched , this
day , on the foul black @-@ spot of its fair Convention Domain ; has trodden
on it , and yet not trodden it down . Alas , it is a well @-@ spring , as we
said , this black @-@ spot ; and will not tread down !



Chapter 3.2.II.

The Executive .

May we not conjecture therefore that round this grand enterprise
of Making the Constitution there will , as heretofore , very strange
embroilments gather , and questions and interests complicate themselves ;
so that after a few or even several months , the Convention will not
have settled every thing ? Alas , a whole tide of questions comes rolling ,
boiling ; growing ever wider , without end ! Among which , apart from this
question of September and Anarchy , let us notice those , which emerge
oftener than the others , and promise to become Leading Questions : of the
Armies ; of the Subsistences ; thirdly , of the Dethroned King .

As to the Armies , Public Defence must evidently be put on a proper
footing ; for Europe seems coalising itself again ; one is apprehensive
even England will join it . Happily Dumouriez prospers in the North ; -- nay
what if he should prove too prosperous , and become Liberticide , Murderer
of Freedom ! -- Dumouriez prospers , through this winter season ; yet not
without lamentable complaints . Sleek Pache , the Swiss Schoolmaster ,
he that sat frugal in his Alley , the wonder of neighbours , has got
lately -- whither thinks the Reader ? To be Minister of war ! Madame Roland ,
struck with his sleek ways , recommended him to her Husband as Clerk : the
sleek Clerk had no need of salary , being of true Patriotic temper ; he
would come with a bit of bread in his pocket , to save dinner and time ;
and , munching incidentally , do three men &apos;s work in a day , punctual ,
silent , frugal , -- the sleek Tartuffe that he was . Wherefore Roland , in
the late Overturn , recommended him to be War @-@ Minister . And now , it would
seem , he is secretly undermining Roland ; playing into the hands of your
hotter Jacobins and September Commune ; and cannot , like strict Roland ,
be the Veto des Coquins ! ( Madame Roland , Memoires , ii . 237 , &amp; c . )

How the sleek Pache might mine and undermine , one knows not well ; this
however one does know : that his War @-@ Office has become a den of thieves
and confusion , such as all men shudder to behold . That the Citizen
Hassenfratz , as Head @-@ Clerk , sits there in bonnet rouge , in rapine ,
in violence , and some Mathematical calculation ; a most insolent ,
red @-@ nightcapped man . That Pache munches his pocket @-@ loaf , amid
head @-@ clerks and sub @-@ clerks , and has spent all the War @-@ Estimates : that
Furnishers scour in gigs , over all districts of France , and drive
bargains ; -- and lastly that the Army gets next to no furniture . No shoes ,
though it is winter ; no clothes ; some have not even arms : &apos; In the
Army of the South , &apos; complains an honourable Member , &apos; there are thirty
thousand pairs of breeches wanting , &apos; -- a most scandalous want .

Roland &apos;s strict soul is sick to see the course things take : but what can
he do ? Keep his own Department strict ; rebuke , and repress wheresoever
possible ; at lowest , complain . He can complain in Letter after Letter ,
to a National Convention , to France , to Posterity , the Universe ; grow
ever more querulous indignant ; -- till at last may he not grow wearisome ?
For is not this continual text of his , at bottom a rather barren one :
How astonishing that in a time of Revolt and abrogation of all Law
but Cannon Law , there should be such Unlawfulness ? Intrepid
Veto @-@ of @-@ Scoundrels , narrow @-@ faithful , respectable , methodic man , work
thou in that manner , since happily it is thy manner , and wear thyself
away ; though ineffectual , not profitless in it -- then nor now ! -- The brave
Dame Roland , bravest of all French women , begins to have misgivings :
the figure of Danton has too much of the &apos; Sardanapalus character , &apos; at a
Republican Rolandin Dinner @-@ table : Clootz , Speaker of Mankind , proses sad
stuff about a Universal Republic , or union of all Peoples and Kindreds
in one and the same Fraternal Bond ; of which Bond , how it is to be tied ,
one unhappily sees not .

It is also an indisputable , unaccountable or accountable fact that
Grains are becoming scarcer and scarcer . Riots for grain , tumultuous
Assemblages demanding to have the price of grain fixed abound far and
near . The Mayor of Paris and other poor Mayors are like to have their
difficulties . Petion was re @-@ elected Mayor of Paris ; but has declined ;
being now a Convention Legislator . Wise surely to decline : for , besides
this of Grains and all the rest , there is in these times an Improvised
insurrectionary Commune passing into an Elected legal one ; getting
their accounts settled , -- not without irritancy ! Petion has declined :
nevertheless many do covet and canvass . After months of scrutinising ,
balloting , arguing and jargoning , one Doctor Chambon gets the post of
honour : who will not long keep it ; but be , as we shall see , literally
crushed out of it . ( Dictionnaire des Hommes Marquans , para Chambon . )

Think also if the private Sansculotte has not his difficulties , in a
time of dearth ! Bread , according to the People &apos;s @-@ Friend , may be some
&apos;six sous per pound , a day &apos;s wages some fifteen ; &apos; and grim winter here .
How the Poor Man continues living , and so seldom starves , by miracle !
Happily , in these days , he can enlist , and have himself shot by the
Austrians , in an unusually satisfactory manner : for the Rights of
Man . -- But Commandant Santerre , in this so straitened condition of the
flour @-@ market , and state of Equality and Liberty , proposes , through
the Newspapers , two remedies , or at least palliatives : First , that all
classes of men should live , two days of the week , on potatoes ; then
second , that every man should hang his dog . Hereby , as the Commandant
thinks , the saving , which indeed he computes to so many sacks , would
be very considerable . A cheerfuller form of inventive @-@ stupidity than
Commandant Santerre &apos;s dwells in no human soul . Inventive @-@ stupidity ,
imbedded in health , courage and good @-@ nature : much to be commended . &quot; My
whole strength , &quot; he tells the Convention once , &quot; is , day and night , at
the service of my fellow @-@ Citizens : if they find me worthless , they will
dismiss me ; I will return and brew beer . &quot; ( Moniteur in Hist . Parl. xx .
412 . )

Or figure what correspondences a poor Roland , Minister of the Interior ,
must have , on this of Grains alone ! Free @-@ trade in Grain , impossibility
to fix the Prices of Grain ; on the other hand , clamour and necessity
to fix them : Political Economy lecturing from the Home Office , with
demonstration clear as Scripture ; -- ineffectual for the empty National
Stomach . The Mayor of Chartres , like to be eaten himself , cries to the
Convention : the Convention sends honourable Members in Deputation ; who
endeavour to feed the multitude by miraculous spiritual methods ; but
cannot . The multitude , in spite of all Eloquence , come bellowing round ;
will have the Grain @-@ Prices fixed , and at a moderate elevation ; or
else -- the honourable Deputies hanged on the spot ! The honourable
Deputies , reporting this business , admit that , on the edge of horrid
death , they did fix , or affect to fix the Price of Grain : for which ,
be it also noted , the Convention , a Convention that will not be trifled
with , sees good to reprimand them . ( Hist . Parl. xx . 431 @-@ 440 . )

But as to the origin of these Grain Riots , is it not most probably your
secret Royalists again ? Glimpses of Priests were discernible in this of
Chartres , -- to the eye of Patriotism . Or indeed may not &apos; the root of it
all lie in the Temple Prison , in the heart of a perjured King , &apos; well as
we guard him ? ( Ibid . 409 . ) Unhappy perjured King ! -- And so there shall
be Baker &apos;s Queues , by and by , more sharp @-@ tempered than ever : on every
Baker &apos;s door @-@ rabbet an iron ring , and coil of rope ; whereon , with
firm grip , on this side and that , we form our Queue : but mischievous
deceitful persons cut the rope , and our Queue becomes a ravelment ;
wherefore the coil must be made of iron chain . ( Mercier , Nouveau Paris . )
Also there shall be Prices of Grain well fixed ; but then no grain
purchasable by them : bread not to be had except by Ticket from the
Mayor , few ounces per mouth daily ; after long swaying , with firm grip ,
on the chain of the Queue . And Hunger shall stalk direful ; and Wrath and
Suspicion , whetted to the Preternatural pitch , shall stalk ; -- as
those other preternatural &apos; shapes of Gods in their wrathfulness &apos; were
discerned stalking , &apos; in glare and gloom of that fire @-@ ocean , &apos; when Troy
Town fell ! --



Chapter 3.2.III.

Discrowned .

But the question more pressing than all on the Legislator , as yet , is
this third : What shall be done with King Louis ?

King Louis , now King and Majesty to his own family alone , in their own
Prison Apartment alone , has been Louis Capet and the Traitor Veto with
the rest of France . Shut in his Circuit of the Temple , he has heard and
seen the loud whirl of things ; yells of September Massacres , Brunswick
war @-@ thunders dying off in disaster and discomfiture ; he passive , a
spectator merely ; -- waiting whither it would please to whirl with him .
From the neighbouring windows , the curious , not without pity , might see
him walk daily , at a certain hour , in the Temple Garden , with his Queen ,
Sister and two Children , all that now belongs to him in this Earth .
( Moore , i . 123 ; ii . 224 , &amp; c . ) Quietly he walks and waits ; for he is not
of lively feelings , and is of a devout heart . The wearied Irresolute
has , at least , no need of resolving now . His daily meals , lessons to his
Son , daily walk in the Garden , daily game at ombre or drafts , fill up
the day : the morrow will provide for itself .

The morrow indeed ; and yet How ? Louis asks , How ? France , with perhaps
still more solicitude , asks , How ? A King dethroned by insurrection is
verily not easy to dispose of . Keep him prisoner , he is a secret centre
for the Disaffected , for endless plots , attempts and hopes of theirs .
Banish him , he is an open centre for them ; his royal war @-@ standard , with
what of divinity it has , unrolls itself , summoning the world . Put him to
death ? A cruel questionable extremity that too : and yet the likeliest in
these extreme circumstances , of insurrectionary men , whose own life and
death lies staked : accordingly it is said , from the last step of the
throne to the first of the scaffold there is short distance .

But , on the whole , we will remark here that this business of Louis
looks altogether different now , as seen over Seas and at the distance
of forty @-@ four years , than it looked then , in France , and struggling ,
confused all round one ! For indeed it is a most lying thing that same
Past Tense always : so beautiful , sad , almost Elysian @-@ sacred , &apos; in the
moonlight of Memory , &apos; it seems ; and seems only . For observe : always , one
most important element is surreptitiously ( we not noticing it ) withdrawn
from the Past Time : the haggard element of Fear ! Not there does Fear
dwell , nor Uncertainty , nor Anxiety ; but it dwells here ; haunting us ,
tracking us ; running like an accursed ground @-@ discord through all the
music @-@ tones of our Existence ; -- making the Tense a mere Present one ! Just
so is it with this of Louis . Why smite the fallen ? asks Magnanimity , out
of danger now . He is fallen so low this once @-@ high man ; no criminal nor
traitor , how far from it ; but the unhappiest of Human Solecisms : whom if
abstract Justice had to pronounce upon , she might well become concrete
Pity , and pronounce only sobs and dismissal !

So argues retrospective Magnanimity : but Pusillanimity , present ,
prospective ? Reader , thou hast never lived , for months , under the
rustle of Prussian gallows @-@ ropes ; never wert thou portion of a
National Sahara @-@ waltz , Twenty @-@ five millions running distracted to
fight Brunswick ! Knights Errant themselves , when they conquered Giants ,
usually slew the Giants : quarter was only for other Knights Errant ,
who knew courtesy and the laws of battle . The French Nation , in
simultaneous , desperate dead @-@ pull , and as if by miracle of madness ,
has pulled down the most dread Goliath , huge with the growth of ten
centuries ; and cannot believe , though his giant bulk , covering acres ,
lies prostrate , bound with peg and packthread , that he will not rise
again , man @-@ devouring ; that the victory is not partly a dream . Terror
has its scepticism ; miraculous victory its rage of vengeance . Then as to
criminalty , is the prostrated Giant , who will devour us if he rise , an
innocent Giant ? Curate Gregoire , who indeed is now Constitutional Bishop
Gregoire , asserts , in the heat of eloquence , that Kingship by the very
nature of it is a crime capital ; that Kings &apos; Houses are as wild @-@ beasts&apos;
dens . ( Moniteur , Seance du 21 Septembre , Annee 1er , 1792 . ) Lastly
consider this : that there is on record a Trial of Charles First ! This
printed Trial of Charles First is sold and read every where at present :
( Moore &apos;s Journal , ii . 165 . ) -- Quelle spectacle ! Thus did the English
People judge their Tyrant , and become the first of Free Peoples : which
feat , by the grace of Destiny , may not France now rival ? Scepticism
of terror , rage of miraculous victory , sublime spectacle to the
universe , -- all things point one fatal way .

Such leading questions , and their endless incidental ones : of September
Anarchists and Departmental Guard ; of Grain Riots , plaintiff Interior
Ministers ; of Armies , Hassenfratz dilapidations ; and what is to be
done with Louis , -- beleaguer and embroil this Convention ; which would
so gladly make the Constitution rather . All which questions too , as
we often urge of such things , are in growth ; they grow in every French
head ; and can be seen growing also , very curiously , in this mighty
welter of Parliamentary Debate , of Public Business which the Convention
has to do . A question emerges , so small at first ; is put off , submerged ;
but always re @-@ emerges bigger than before . It is a curious , indeed an
indescribable sort of growth which such things have .

We perceive , however , both by its frequent re @-@ emergence and by its rapid
enlargement of bulk , that this Question of King Louis will take the lead
of all the rest . And truly , in that case , it will take the lead in a
much deeper sense . For as Aaron &apos;s Rod swallowed all the other Serpents ;
so will the Foremost Question , whichever may get foremost , absorb all
other questions and interests ; and from it and the decision of it will
they all , so to speak , be born , or new @-@ born , and have shape , physiognomy
and destiny corresponding . It was appointed of Fate that , in this
wide @-@ weltering , strangely growing , monstrous stupendous imbroglio
of Convention Business , the grand First @-@ Parent of all the questions ,
controversies , measures and enterprises which were to be evolved there
to the world &apos;s astonishment , should be this Question of King Louis .



Chapter 3.2.IV.

The Loser pays .

The Sixth of November , 1792 , was a great day for the Republic :
outwardly , over the Frontiers ; inwardly , in the Salle de Manege .

Outwardly : for Dumouriez , overrunning the Netherlands , did , on that
day , come in contact with Saxe @-@ Teschen and the Austrians ; Dumouriez
wide @-@ winged , they wide @-@ winged ; at and around the village of Jemappes ,
near Mons . And fire @-@ hail is whistling far and wide there , the great guns
playing , and the small ; so many green Heights getting fringed and maned
with red Fire . And Dumouriez is swept back on this wing , and swept back
on that , and is like to be swept back utterly ; when he rushes up in
person , the prompt Polymetis ; speaks a prompt word or two ; and then ,
with clear tenor @-@ pipe , &apos; uplifts the Hymn of the Marseillese , entonna la
Marseillaise , &apos; ( Dumouriez , Memoires , iii . 174 . ) ten thousand tenor or
bass pipes joining ; or say , some Forty Thousand in all ; for every heart
leaps at the sound : and so with rhythmic march @-@ melody , waxing ever
quicker , to double and to treble quick , they rally , they advance ,
they rush , death @-@ defying , man @-@ devouring ; carry batteries , redoutes ,
whatsoever is to be carried ; and , like the fire @-@ whirlwind , sweep all
manner of Austrians from the scene of action . Thus , through the hands
of Dumouriez , may Rouget de Lille , in figurative speech , be said to
have gained , miraculously , like another Orpheus , by his Marseillese
fiddle @-@ strings ( fidibus canoris ) a Victory of Jemappes ; and conquered
the Low Countries .

Young General Egalite , it would seem , shone brave among the bravest
on this occasion . Doubtless a brave Egalite ; -- whom however does not
Dumouriez rather talk of oftener than need were ? The Mother Society has
her own thoughts . As for the Elder Egalite he flies low at this time ;
appears in the Convention for some half @-@ hour daily , with rubicund ,
pre @-@ occupied , or impressive quasi @-@ contemptuous countenance ; and then
takes himself away . ( Moore , ii . 148 . ) The Netherlands are conquered , at
least overrun . Jacobin missionaries , your Prolys , Pereiras , follow
in the train of the Armies ; also Convention Commissioners , melting
church @-@ plate , revolutionising and remodelling -- among whom Danton , in
brief space , does immensities of business ; not neglecting his own wages
and trade @-@ profits , it is thought . Hassenfratz dilapidates at home ;
Dumouriez grumbles and they dilapidate abroad : within the walls there is
sinning , and without the walls there is sinning .

But in the Hall of the Convention , at the same hour with this victory
of Jemappes , there went another thing forward : Report , of great length ,
from the proper appointed Committee , on the Crimes of Louis . The
Galleries listen breathless ; take comfort , ye Galleries : Deputy Valaze ,
Reporter on this occasion , thinks Louis very criminal ; and that , if
convenient , he should be tried ; -- poor Girondin Valaze , who may be
tried himself , one day ! Comfortable so far . Nay here comes a second
Committee @-@ reporter , Deputy Mailhe , with a Legal Argument , very prosy to
read now , very refreshing to hear then , That , by the Law of the Country ,
Louis Capet was only called Inviolable by a figure of rhetoric ; but at
bottom was perfectly violable , triable ; that he can , and even should be
tried . This Question of Louis , emerging so often as an angry confused
possibility , and submerging again , has emerged now in an articulate
shape .

Patriotism growls indignant joy . The so @-@ called reign of Equality is
not to be a mere name , then , but a thing ! Try Louis Capet ? scornfully
ejaculates Patriotism : Mean criminals go to the gallows for a purse cut ;
and this chief criminal , guilty of a France cut ; of a France slashed
asunder with Clotho @-@ scissors and Civil war ; with his victims &apos; twelve
hundred on the Tenth of August alone &apos; lying low in the Catacombs ,
fattening the passes of Argonne Wood , of Valmy and far Fields ; he ,
such chief criminal , shall not even come to the bar ? -- For , alas , O
Patriotism ! add we , it was from of old said , The loser pays ! It is
he who has to pay all scores , run up by whomsoever ; on him must all
breakages and charges fall ; and the twelve hundred on the Tenth of
August are not rebel traitors , but victims and martyrs : such is the law
of quarrel .

Patriotism , nothing doubting , watches over this Question of the Trial ,
now happily emerged in an articulate shape ; and will see it to maturity ,
if the gods permit . With a keen solicitude Patriotism watches ; getting
ever keener , at every new difficulty , as Girondins and false brothers
interpose delays ; till it get a keenness as of fixed @-@ idea , and will have
this Trial and no earthly thing instead of it , -- if Equality be not a
name . Love of Equality ; then scepticism of terror , rage of victory ,
sublime spectacle of the universe : all these things are strong .

But indeed this Question of the Trial , is it not to all persons a most
grave one ; filling with dubiety many a Legislative head ! Regicide ? asks
the Gironde Respectability : To kill a king , and become the horror of
respectable nations and persons ? But then also , to save a king ; to lose
one &apos;s footing with the decided Patriot ; and undecided Patriot , though
never so respectable , being mere hypothetic froth and no footing ? -- The
dilemma presses sore ; and between the horns of it you wriggle round and
round . Decision is nowhere , save in the Mother Society and her Sons .
These have decided , and go forward : the others wriggle round uneasily
within their dilemma @-@ horns , and make way nowhither .



Chapter 3.2.V.

Stretching of Formulas .

But how this Question of the Trial grew laboriously , through the weeks
of gestation , now that it has been articulated or conceived , were
superfluous to trace here . It emerged and submerged among the infinite
of questions and embroilments . The Veto of Scoundrels writes plaintive
Letters as to Anarchy ; &apos; concealed Royalists , &apos; aided by Hunger , produce
Riots about Grain . Alas , it is but a week ago , these Girondins made a
new fierce onslaught on the September Massacres !

For , one day , among the last of October , Robespierre , being summoned to
the tribune by some new hint of that old calumny of the Dictatorship ,
was speaking and pleading there , with more and more comfort to himself ;
till , rising high in heart , he cried out valiantly : Is there any man
here that dare specifically accuse me ? &quot; Moi ! &quot; exclaimed one . Pause of
deep silence : a lean angry little Figure , with broad bald brow , strode
swiftly towards the tribune , taking papers from its pocket : &quot; I accuse
thee , Robespierre , &quot; -- I , Jean Baptiste Louvet ! The Seagreen became
tallow @-@ green ; shrinking to a corner of the tribune : Danton cried ,
&quot; Speak , Robespierre , there are many good citizens that listen ; &quot; but the
tongue refused its office . And so Louvet , with a shrill tone , read and
recited crime after crime : dictatorial temper , exclusive popularity ,
bullying at elections , mob @-@ retinue , September Massacres ; -- till all the
Convention shrieked again , and had almost indicted the Incorruptible
there on the spot . Never did the Incorruptible run such a risk . Louvet ,
to his dying day , will regret that the Gironde did not take a bolder
attitude , and extinguish him there and then .

Not so , however : the Incorruptible , about to be indicted in this sudden
manner , could not be refused a week of delay . That week , he is not idle ;
nor is the Mother Society idle , -- fierce @-@ tremulous for her chosen son .
He is ready at the day with his written Speech ; smooth as a Jesuit
Doctor &apos;s ; and convinces some . And now ? Why , now lazy Vergniaud does not
rise with Demosthenic thunder ; poor Louvet , unprepared , can do little
or nothing : Barrere proposes that these comparatively despicable
&apos;personalities &apos; be dismissed by order of the day ! Order of the day it
accordingly is . Barbaroux cannot even get a hearing ; not though he rush
down to the Bar , and demand to be heard there as a petitioner . ( Louvet ,
Memoires ( Paris , 1823 ) p . 52 ; Moniteur ( Seances du 29 Octobre , 5
Novembre , 1792 ) ; Moore ( ii . 178 ) , &amp; c . ) The convention , eager for public
business ( with that first articulate emergence of the Trial just coming
on ) , dismisses these comparative miseres and despicabilities : splenetic
Louvet must digest his spleen , regretfully for ever : Robespierre , dear
to Patriotism , is dearer for the dangers he has run .

This is the second grand attempt by our Girondin Friends of Order , to
extinguish that black @-@ spot in their domain ; and we see they have made it
far blacker and wider than before ! Anarchy , September Massacre : it is a
thing that lies hideous in the general imagination ; very detestable to
the undecided Patriot , of Respectability : a thing to be harped on as
often as need is . Harp on it , denounce it , trample it , ye Girondin
Patriots : -- and yet behold , the black @-@ spot will not trample down ; it will
only , as we say , trample blacker and wider : fools , it is no black @-@ spot
of the surface , but a well @-@ spring of the deep ! Consider rightly , it is
the apex of the everlasting Abyss , this black @-@ spot , looking up as water
through thin ice ; -- say , as the region of Nether Darkness through your
thin film of Gironde Regulation and Respectability ; trample it not , lest
the film break , and then -- !

The truth is , if our Gironde Friends had an understanding of it , where
were French Patriotism , with all its eloquence , at this moment , had not
that same great Nether Deep , of Bedlam , Fanaticism and Popular wrath and
madness , risen unfathomable on the Tenth of August ? French Patriotism
were an eloquent Reminiscence ; swinging on Prussian gibbets . Nay ,
where , in few months , were it still , should the same great Nether Deep
subside ? -- Nay , as readers of Newspapers pretend to recollect , this
hatefulness of the September Massacre is itself partly an after @-@ thought :
readers of Newspapers can quote Gorsas and various Brissotins approving
of the September Massacre , at the time it happened ; and calling it a
salutary vengeance ! ( See Hist . Parl. xvii . 401 ; Newspapers by Gorsas and
others , cited ibid . 428 . ) So that the real grief , after all , were not
so much righteous horror , as grief that one &apos;s own power was departing ?
Unhappy Girondins !

In the Jacobin Society , therefore , the decided Patriot complains that
here are men who with their private ambitions and animosities , will ruin
Liberty , Equality , and Brotherhood , all three : they check the spirit of
Patriotism , throw stumbling @-@ blocks in its way ; and instead of pushing
on , all shoulders at the wheel , will stand idle there , spitefully
clamouring what foul ruts there are , what rude jolts we give ! To which
the Jacobin Society answers with angry roar ; -- with angry shriek ,
for there are Citoyennes too , thick crowded in the galleries here .
Citoyennes who bring their seam with them , or their knitting @-@ needles ;
and shriek or knit as the case needs ; famed Tricoteuses , Patriot
Knitters ; -- Mere Duchesse , or the like Deborah and Mother of the
Faubourgs , giving the keynote . It is a changed Jacobin Society ; and a
still changing . Where Mother Duchess now sits , authentic Duchesses have
sat . High @-@ rouged dames went once in jewels and spangles ; now , instead of
jewels , you may take the knitting @-@ needles and leave the rouge : the
rouge will gradually give place to natural brown , clean washed or even
unwashed ; and Demoiselle Theroigne herself get scandalously fustigated .
Strange enough : it is the same tribune raised in mid @-@ air , where a high
Mirabeau , a high Barnave and Aristocrat Lameths once thundered : whom
gradually your Brissots , Guadets , Vergniauds , a hotter style of Patriots
in bonnet rouge , did displace ; red heat , as one may say , superseding
light . And now your Brissots in turn , and Brissotins , Rolandins ,
Girondins , are becoming supernumerary ; must desert the sittings , or
be expelled : the light of the Mighty Mother is burning not red but
blue ! -- Provincial Daughter @-@ Societies loudly disapprove these things ;
loudly demand the swift reinstatement of such eloquent Girondins , the
swift &apos; erasure of Marat , radiation de Marat . &apos; The Mother Society , so far
as natural reason can predict , seems ruining herself . Nevertheless she
has , at all crises , seemed so ; she has a preternatural life in her , and
will not ruin .

But , in a fortnight more , this great Question of the Trial , while the
fit Committee is assiduously but silently working on it , receives
an unexpected stimulus . Our readers remember poor Louis &apos;s turn
for smithwork : how , in old happier days , a certain Sieur Gamain
of Versailles was wont to come over , and instruct him in
lock @-@ making ; -- often scolding him , they say for his numbness . By whom ,
nevertheless , the royal Apprentice had learned something of that craft .
Hapless Apprentice ; perfidious Master @-@ Smith ! For now , on this 20th of
November 1792 , dingy Smith Gamain comes over to the Paris Municipality ,
over to Minister Roland , with hints that he , Smith Gamain , knows a
thing ; that , in May last , when traitorous Correspondence was so brisk ,
he and the royal Apprentice fabricated an &apos; Iron Press , Armoire de Fer , &apos;
cunningly inserting the same in a wall of the royal chamber in the
Tuileries ; invisible under the wainscot ; where doubtless it still
sticks ! Perfidious Gamain , attended by the proper Authorities , finds the
wainscot panel which none else can find ; wrenches it up ; discloses
the Iron Press , -- full of Letters and Papers ! Roland clutches them out ;
conveys them over in towels to the fit assiduous Committee , which sits
hard by . In towels , we say , and without notarial inventory ; an oversight
on the part of Roland .

Here , however , are Letters enough : which disclose to a demonstration the
Correspondence of a traitorous self @-@ preserving Court ; and this not with
Traitors only , but even with Patriots , so @-@ called ! Barnave &apos;s treason , of
Correspondence with the Queen , and friendly advice to her , ever since
that Varennes Business , is hereby manifest : how happy that we have him ,
this Barnave , lying safe in the Prison of Grenoble , since September
last , for he had long been suspect ! Talleyrand &apos;s treason , many a man &apos;s
treason , if not manifest hereby , is next to it . Mirabeau &apos;s treason :
wherefore his Bust in the Hall of the Convention &apos; is veiled with gauze , &apos;
till we ascertain . Alas , it is too ascertainable ! His Bust in the Hall
of the Jacobins , denounced by Robespierre from the tribune in mid @-@ air ,
is not veiled , it is instantly broken to sherds ; a Patriot mounting
swiftly with a ladder , and shivering it down on the floor ; -- it and
others : amid shouts . ( Journal des Debats des Jacobins in Hist . Parl .
xxii . 296 . ) Such is their recompense and amount of wages , at this
date : on the principle of supply and demand ! Smith Gamain , inadequately
recompensed for the present , comes , some fifteen months after , with a
humble Petition ; setting forth that no sooner was that important Iron
Press finished off by him , than ( as he now bethinks himself ) Louis gave
him a large glass of wine . Which large glass of wine did produce in
the stomach of Sieur Gamain the terriblest effects , evidently
tending towards death , and was then brought up by an emetic ; but has ,
notwithstanding , entirely ruined the constitution of Sieur Gamain ; so
that he cannot work for his family ( as he now bethinks himself ) .
The recompense of which is &apos; Pension of Twelve Hundred Francs , &apos; and
&apos;honourable mention . &apos; So different is the ratio of demand and supply at
different times .

Thus , amid obstructions and stimulating furtherances , has the Question
of the Trial to grow ; emerging and submerging ; fostered by solicitous
Patriotism . Of the Orations that were spoken on it , of the painfully
devised Forms of Process for managing it , the Law Arguments to prove it
lawful , and all the infinite floods of Juridical and other ingenuity and
oratory , be no syllable reported in this History . Lawyer ingenuity is
good : but what can it profit here ? If the truth must be spoken , O august
Senators , the only Law in this case is : Vae victis , the loser pays !
Seldom did Robespierre say a wiser word than the hint he gave to that
effect , in his oration , that it was needless to speak of Law , that here ,
if never elsewhere , our Right was Might . An oration admired almost to
ecstasy by the Jacobin Patriot : who shall say that Robespierre is not a
thorough @-@ going man ; bold in Logic at least ? To the like effect , or
still more plainly , spake young Saint @-@ Just , the black @-@ haired , mild @-@ toned
youth . Danton is on mission , in the Netherlands , during this preliminary
work . The rest , far as one reads , welter amid Law of Nations , Social
Contract , Juristics , Syllogistics ; to us barren as the East wind . In
fact , what can be more unprofitable than the sight of Seven Hundred
and Forty @-@ nine ingenious men , struggling with their whole force and
industry , for a long course of weeks , to do at bottom this : To stretch
out the old Formula and Law Phraseology , so that it may cover the new ,
contradictory , entirely uncoverable Thing ? Whereby the poor Formula does
but crack , and one &apos;s honesty along with it ! The thing that is
palpably hot , burning , wilt thou prove it , by syllogism , to be a
freezing @-@ mixture ? This of stretching out Formulas till they crack is ,
especially in times of swift change , one of the sorrowfullest tasks poor
Humanity has .



Chapter 3.2.VI.

At the Bar .

Meanwhile , in a space of some five weeks , we have got to another
emerging of the Trial , and a more practical one than ever .

On Tuesday , eleventh of December , the King &apos;s Trial has emerged , very
decidedly : into the streets of Paris ; in the shape of that green
Carriage of Mayor Chambon , within which sits the King himself , with
attendants , on his way to the Convention Hall ! Attended , in that green
Carriage , by Mayors Chambon , Procureurs Chaumette ; and outside of it by
Commandants Santerre , with cannon , cavalry and double row of infantry ;
all Sections under arms , strong Patrols scouring all streets ; so fares
he , slowly through the dull drizzling weather : and about two o &apos;clock
we behold him , &apos; in walnut @-@ coloured great @-@ coat , redingote noisette , &apos;
descending through the Place Vendome , towards that Salle de Manege ; to
be indicted , and judicially interrogated . The mysterious Temple Circuit
has given up its secret ; which now , in this walnut @-@ coloured coat , men
behold with eyes . The same bodily Louis who was once Louis the
Desired , fares there : hapless King , he is getting now towards port ; his
deplorable farings and voyagings draw to a close . What duty remains to
him henceforth , that of placidly enduring , he is fit to do .

The singular Procession fares on ; in silence , says Prudhomme , or amid
growlings of the Marseillese Hymn ; in silence , ushers itself into the
Hall of the Convention , Santerre holding Louis &apos;s arm with his hand .
Louis looks round him , with composed air , to see what kind of Convention
and Parliament it is . Much changed indeed : -- since February gone two
years , when our Constituent , then busy , spread fleur @-@ de @-@ lys velvet for
us ; and we came over to say a kind word here , and they all started up
swearing Fidelity ; and all France started up swearing , and made it
a Feast of Pikes ; which has ended in this ! Barrere , who once
&apos;wept &apos; looking up from his Editor &apos;s @-@ Desk , looks down now from his
President &apos;s @-@ Chair , with a list of Fifty @-@ seven Questions ; and says ,
dry @-@ eyed : &quot; Louis , you may sit down . &quot; Louis sits down : it is the very
seat , they say , same timber and stuffing , from which he accepted the
Constitution , amid dancing and illumination , autumn gone a year . So much
woodwork remains identical ; so much else is not identical . Louis sits
and listens , with a composed look and mind .

Of the Fifty @-@ seven Questions we shall not give so much as one . They
are questions captiously embracing all the main Documents seized on the
Tenth of August , or found lately in the Iron Press ; embracing all the
main incidents of the Revolution History ; and they ask , in substance ,
this : Louis , who wert King , art thou not guilty to a certain extent ,
by act and written document , of trying to continue King ? Neither in the
Answers is there much notable . Mere quiet negations , for most part ; an
accused man standing on the simple basis of No : I do not recognise that
document ; I did not do that act ; or did it according to the law that
then was . Whereupon the Fifty @-@ seven Questions , and Documents to the
number of a Hundred and Sixty @-@ two , being exhausted in this manner ,
Barrere finishes , after some three hours , with his : &quot; Louis , I invite you
to withdraw . &quot;

Louis withdraws , under Municipal escort , into a neighbouring
Committee @-@ room ; having first , in leaving the bar , demanded to have Legal
Counsel . He declines refreshment , in this Committee @-@ room , then , seeing
Chaumette busy with a small loaf which a grenadier had divided with
him , says , he will take a bit of bread . It is five o &apos;clock ; and he
had breakfasted but slightly in a morning of such drumming and alarm .
Chaumette breaks his half @-@ loaf : the King eats of the crust ; mounts
the green Carriage , eating ; asks now what he shall do with the crumb ?
Chaumette &apos;s clerk takes it from him ; flings it out into the street .
Louis says , It is pity to fling out bread , in a time of dearth . &quot; My
grandmother , &quot; remarks Chaumette , &quot; used to say to me , Little boy , never
waste a crumb of bread , you cannot make one . &quot; &quot; Monsieur Chaumette , &quot;
answers Louis , &quot; your grandmother seems to have been a sensible woman . &quot;
( Prudhomme &apos;s Newspaper in Hist . Parl. xxi . 314 . ) Poor innocent mortal :
so quietly he waits the drawing of the lot ; -- fit to do this at least
well ; Passivity alone , without Activity , sufficing for it ! He talks
once of travelling over France by and by , to have a geographical and
topographical view of it ; being from of old fond of geography . -- The
Temple Circuit again receives him , closes on him ; gazing Paris may
retire to its hearths and coffee @-@ houses , to its clubs and theatres : the
damp Darkness has sunk , and with it the drumming and patrolling of this
strange Day .

Louis is now separated from his Queen and Family ; given up to his simple
reflections and resources . Dull lie these stone walls round him ; of his
loved ones none with him . In this state of &apos; uncertainty , &apos; providing for
the worst , he writes his Will : a Paper which can still be read ; full of
placidity , simplicity , pious sweetness . The Convention , after debate ,
has granted him Legal Counsel , of his own choosing . Advocate Target
feels himself &apos; too old , &apos; being turned of fifty @-@ four ; and declines . He
had gained great honour once , defending Rohan the Necklace @-@ Cardinal ; but
will gain none here . Advocate Tronchet , some ten years older , does not
decline . Nay behold , good old Malesherbes steps forward voluntarily ;
to the last of his fields , the good old hero ! He is grey with seventy
years : he says , &apos; I was twice called to the Council of him who was my
Master , when all the world coveted that honour ; and I owe him the same
service now , when it has become one which many reckon dangerous . &apos; These
two , with a younger Deseze , whom they will select for pleading , are busy
over that Fifty @-@ and @-@ sevenfold Indictment , over the Hundred and Sixty @-@ two
Documents ; Louis aiding them as he can .

A great Thing is now therefore in open progress ; all men , in all lands ,
watching it . By what Forms and Methods shall the Convention acquit
itself , in such manner that there rest not on it even the suspicion of
blame ? Difficult that will be ! The Convention , really much at a loss ,
discusses and deliberates . All day from morning to night , day after day ,
the Tribune drones with oratory on this matter ; one must stretch the old
Formula to cover the new Thing . The Patriots of the Mountain , whetted
ever keener , clamour for despatch above all ; the only good Form will
be a swift one . Nevertheless the Convention deliberates ; the Tribune
drones , -- drowned indeed in tenor , and even in treble , from time to time ;
the whole Hall shrilling up round it into pretty frequent wrath and
provocation . It has droned and shrilled wellnigh a fortnight , before
we can decide , this shrillness getting ever shriller , That on Wednesday
26th of December , Louis shall appear , and plead . His Advocates complain
that it is fatally soon ; which they well might as Advocates : but without
remedy ; to Patriotism it seems endlessly late .

On Wednesday , therefore , at the cold dark hour of eight in the morning ,
all Senators are at their post . Indeed they warm the cold hour , as we
find , by a violent effervescence , such as is too common now ; some Louvet
or Buzot attacking some Tallien , Chabot ; and so the whole Mountain
effervescing against the whole Gironde . Scarcely is this done , at nine ,
when Louis and his three Advocates , escorted by the clang of arms and
Santerre &apos;s National force , enter the Hall .

Deseze unfolds his papers ; honourably fulfilling his perilous office ,
pleads for the space of three hours . An honourable Pleading , &apos; composed
almost overnight ; &apos; courageous yet discreet ; not without ingenuity ,
and soft pathetic eloquence : Louis fell on his neck , when they had
withdrawn , and said with tears , Mon pauvre Deseze . Louis himself , before
withdrawing , had added a few words , &quot; perhaps the last he would utter to
them : &quot; how it pained his heart , above all things , to be held guilty of
that bloodshed on the Tenth of August ; or of ever shedding or wishing to
shed French blood . So saying , he withdrew from that Hall ; -- having
indeed finished his work there . Many are the strange errands he has had
thither ; but this strange one is the last .

And now , why will the Convention loiter ? Here is the Indictment and
Evidence ; here is the Pleading : does not the rest follow of itself ? The
Mountain , and Patriotism in general , clamours still louder for despatch ;
for Permanent @-@ session , till the task be done . Nevertheless a doubting ,
apprehensive Convention decides that it will still deliberate first ;
that all Members , who desire it , shall have leave to speak . -- To your
desks , therefore , ye eloquent Members ! Down with your thoughts , your
echoes and hearsays of thoughts : now is the time to shew oneself ;
France and the Universe listens ! Members are not wanting : Oration
spoken Pamphlet follows spoken Pamphlet , with what eloquence it can :
President &apos;s List swells ever higher with names claiming to speak ; from
day to day , all days and all hours , the constant Tribune drones ; -- shrill
Galleries supplying , very variably , the tenor and treble . It were a dull
tune otherwise .

The Patriots , in Mountain and Galleries , or taking counsel nightly in
Section @-@ house , in Mother Society , amid their shrill Tricoteuses , have
to watch lynx @-@ eyed ; to give voice when needful ; occasionally very loud .
Deputy Thuriot , he who was Advocate Thuriot , who was Elector Thuriot ,
and from the top of the Bastille , saw Saint @-@ Antoine rising like the
ocean ; this Thuriot can stretch a Formula as heartily as most men . Cruel
Billaud is not silent , if you incite him . Nor is cruel Jean @-@ Bon silent ;
a kind of Jesuit he too ; -- write him not , as the Dictionaries too often
do , Jambon , which signifies mere Ham .

But , on the whole , let no man conceive it possible that Louis is not
guilty . The only question for a reasonable man is , or was : Can the
Convention judge Louis ? Or must it be the whole People : in Primary
Assembly , and with delay ? Always delay , ye Girondins , false hommes
d &apos;etat ! so bellows Patriotism , its patience almost failing . -- But indeed ,
if we consider it , what shall these poor Girondins do ? Speak their
convictions that Louis is a Prisoner of War ; and cannot be put to death
without injustice , solecism , peril ? Speak such conviction ; and lose
utterly your footing with the decided Patriot ? Nay properly it is
not even a conviction , but a conjecture and dim puzzle . How many poor
Girondins are sure of but one thing : That a man and Girondin ought to
have footing somewhere , and to stand firmly on it ; keeping well with the
Respectable Classes ! This is what conviction and assurance of faith
they have . They must wriggle painfully between their dilemma @-@ horns . ( See
Extracts from their Newspapers , in Hist . Parl. xxi . 1 @-@ 38 , &amp; c . )

Nor is France idle , nor Europe . It is a Heart this Convention , as we
said , which sends out influences , and receives them . A King &apos;s Execution ,
call it Martyrdom , call it Punishment , were an influence ! Two notable
influences this Convention has already sent forth , over all Nations ;
much to its own detriment . On the 19th of November , it emitted a Decree ,
and has since confirmed and unfolded the details of it . That any Nation
which might see good to shake off the fetters of Despotism was thereby ,
so to speak , the Sister of France , and should have help and countenance .
A Decree much noised of by Diplomatists , Editors , International Lawyers ;
such a Decree as no living Fetter of Despotism , nor Person in Authority
anywhere , can approve of ! It was Deputy Chambon the Girondin who
propounded this Decree ; -- at bottom perhaps as a flourish of rhetoric .

The second influence we speak of had a still poorer origin : in the
restless loud @-@ rattling slightly @-@ furnished head of one Jacob Dupont from
the Loire country . The Convention is speculating on a plan of National
Education : Deputy Dupont in his speech says , &quot; I am free to avow , M. le
President , that I for my part am an Atheist , &quot; ( Moniteur , Seance du 14
Decembre 1792 . ) -- thinking the world might like to know that . The French
world received it without commentary ; or with no audible commentary ,
so loud was France otherwise . The Foreign world received it with
confutation , with horror and astonishment ; ( Mrs. Hannah More , Letter to
Jacob Dupont ( London , 1793 ) ; &amp; c . &amp; c . ) a most miserable influence this !
And now if to these two were added a third influence , and sent pulsing
abroad over all the Earth : that of Regicide ?

Foreign Courts interfere in this Trial of Louis ; Spain , England : not to
be listened to ; though they come , as it were , at least Spain comes ,
with the olive @-@ branch in one hand , and the sword without scabbard in the
other . But at home too , from out of this circumambient Paris and France ,
what influences come thick @-@ pulsing ! Petitions flow in ; pleading for
equal justice , in a reign of so @-@ called Equality . The living Patriot
pleads ; -- O ye National Deputies , do not the dead Patriots plead ? The
Twelve Hundred that lie in cold obstruction , do not they plead ; and
petition , in Death &apos;s dumb @-@ show , from their narrow house there , more
eloquently than speech ? Crippled Patriots hop on crutches round the
Salle de Manege , demanding justice . The Wounded of the Tenth of August ,
the Widows and Orphans of the Killed petition in a body ; and hop and
defile , eloquently mute , through the Hall : one wounded Patriot , unable
to hop , is borne on his bed thither , and passes shoulder @-@ high , in the
horizontal posture . ( Hist . Parl. xxii . 131 ; Moore , &amp; c . ) The Convention
Tribune , which has paused at such sight , commences again , -- droning
mere Juristic Oratory . But out of doors Paris is piping ever higher .
Bull @-@ voiced St. Huruge is heard ; and the hysteric eloquence of Mother
Duchesse : &apos; Varlet , Apostle of Liberty , &apos; with pike and red cap , flies
hastily , carrying his oratorical folding @-@ stool . Justice on the Traitor !
cries all the Patriot world . Consider also this other cry , heard loud
on the streets : &quot; Give us Bread , or else kill us ! &quot; Bread and Equality ;
Justice on the Traitor , that we may have Bread !

The Limited or undecided Patriot is set against the Decided . Mayor
Chambon heard of dreadful rioting at the Theatre de la Nation : it had
come to rioting , and even to fist @-@ work , between the Decided and the
Undecided , touching a new Drama called Ami des Lois ( Friend of the
Laws ) . One of the poorest Dramas ever written ; but which had didactic
applications in it ; wherefore powdered wigs of Friends of Order and
black hair of Jacobin heads are flying there ; and Mayor Chambon hastens
with Santerre , in hopes to quell it . Far from quelling it , our poor
Mayor gets so &apos; squeezed , &apos; says the Report , and likewise so blamed
and bullied , say we , -- that he , with regret , quits the brief Mayoralty
altogether , &apos; his lungs being affected . &apos; This miserable Amis des Lois is
debated of in the Convention itself ; so violent , mutually @-@ enraged , are
the Limited Patriots and the Unlimited . ( Hist . Parl. xxiii . 31 , 48 , &amp; c . )

Between which two classes , are not Aristocrats enough , and
Crypto @-@ Aristocrats , busy ? Spies running over from London with important
Packets ; spies pretending to run ! One of these latter , Viard was the
name of him , pretended to accuse Roland , and even the Wife of Roland ; to
the joy of Chabot and the Mountain . But the Wife of Roland came , being
summoned , on the instant , to the Convention Hall ; came , in her high
clearness ; and , with few clear words , dissipated this Viard into
despicability and air ; all Friends of Order applauding . ( Moniteur ,
Seance du 7 Decembre 1792 . ) So , with Theatre @-@ riots , and &apos; Bread , or else
kill us ; &apos; with Rage , Hunger , preternatural Suspicion , does this wild
Paris pipe . Roland grows ever more querulous , in his Messages and
Letters ; rising almost to the hysterical pitch . Marat , whom no power
on Earth can prevent seeing into traitors and Rolands , takes to bed
for three days ; almost dead , the invaluable People &apos;s @-@ Friend , with
heartbreak , with fever and headache : &apos; O , Peuple babillard , si tu savais
agir , People of Babblers , if thou couldst but act ! &apos;

To crown all , victorious Dumouriez , in these New @-@ year &apos;s days , is arrived
in Paris ; -- one fears , for no good . He pretends to be complaining of
Minister Pache , and Hassenfratz dilapidations ; to be concerting measures
for the spring campaign : one finds him much in the company of the
Girondins . Plotting with them against Jacobinism , against Equality ,
and the Punishment of Louis ! We have Letters of his to the Convention
itself . Will he act the old Lafayette part , this new victorious General ?
Let him withdraw again ; not undenounced . ( Dumouriez , Memoires , iii. c .
4 . )

And still , in the Convention Tribune , it drones continually , mere
Juristic Eloquence , and Hypothesis without Action ; and there are still
fifties on the President &apos;s List . Nay these Gironde Presidents give their
own party preference : we suspect they play foul with the List ; men of
the Mountain cannot be heard . And still it drones , all through December
into January and a New year ; and there is no end ! Paris pipes round it ;
multitudinous ; ever higher , to the note of the whirlwind . Paris
will &apos; bring cannon from Saint @-@ Denis ; &apos; there is talk of &apos; shutting the
Barriers , &apos; -- to Roland &apos;s horror .

Whereupon , behold , the Convention Tribune suddenly ceases droning : we
cut short , be on the List who likes ; and make end . On Tuesday next , the
Fifteenth of January 1793 , it shall go to the Vote , name by name ; and ,
one way or other , this great game play itself out !



Chapter 3.2.VII.

The Three Votings .

Is Louis Capet guilty of conspiring against Liberty ? Shall our Sentence
be itself final , or need ratifying by Appeal to the People ? If guilty ,
what Punishment ? This is the form agreed to , after uproar and &apos; several
hours of tumultuous indecision : &apos; these are the Three successive
Questions , whereon the Convention shall now pronounce . Paris floods
round their Hall ; multitudinous , many sounding . Europe and all Nations
listen for their answer . Deputy after Deputy shall answer to his name :
Guilty or Not guilty ?

As to the Guilt , there is , as above hinted , no doubt in the mind of
Patriot man . Overwhelming majority pronounces Guilt ; the unanimous
Convention votes for Guilt , only some feeble twenty @-@ eight voting not
Innocence , but refusing to vote at all . Neither does the Second Question
prove doubtful , whatever the Girondins might calculate . Would not Appeal
to the People be another name for civil war ? Majority of two to one
answers that there shall be no Appeal : this also is settled . Loud
Patriotism , now at ten o &apos;clock , may hush itself for the night ; and
retire to its bed not without hope . Tuesday has gone well . On the morrow
comes , What Punishment ? On the morrow is the tug of war .

Consider therefore if , on this Wednesday morning , there is an affluence
of Patriotism ; if Paris stands a @-@ tiptoe , and all Deputies are at their
post ! Seven Hundred and Forty @-@ nine honourable Deputies ; only some twenty
absent on mission , Duchatel and some seven others absent by sickness .
Meanwhile expectant Patriotism and Paris standing a @-@ tiptoe , have need of
patience . For this Wednesday again passes in debate and effervescence ;
Girondins proposing that a &apos; majority of three @-@ fourths &apos; shall be
required ; Patriots fiercely resisting them . Danton , who has just got
back from mission in the Netherlands , does obtain &apos; order of the day&apos;
on this Girondin proposal ; nay he obtains further that we decide sans
desemparer , in Permanent @-@ session , till we have done .

And so , finally , at eight in the evening this Third stupendous Voting ,
by roll @-@ call or appel nominal , does begin . What Punishment ? Girondins
undecided , Patriots decided , men afraid of Royalty , men afraid of
Anarchy , must answer here and now . Infinite Patriotism , dusky in the
lamp @-@ light , floods all corridors , crowds all galleries , sternly waiting
to hear . Shrill @-@ sounding Ushers summon you by Name and Department ; you
must rise to the Tribune and say .

Eye @-@ witnesses have represented this scene of the Third Voting , and of
the votings that grew out of it ; a scene protracted , like to be
endless , lasting , with few brief intervals , from Wednesday till Sunday
morning , -- as one of the strangest seen in the Revolution . Long night
wears itself into day , morning &apos;s paleness is spread over all faces ; and
again the wintry shadows sink , and the dim lamps are lit : but through
day and night and the vicissitude of hours , Member after Member is
mounting continually those Tribune @-@ steps ; pausing aloft there , in the
clearer upper light , to speak his Fate @-@ word ; then diving down into
the dusk and throng again . Like Phantoms in the hour of midnight ; most
spectral , pandemonial ! Never did President Vergniaud , or any terrestrial
President , superintend the like . A King &apos;s Life , and so much else that
depends thereon , hangs trembling in the balance . Man after man
mounts ; the buzz hushes itself till he have spoken : Death ; Banishment :
Imprisonment till the Peace . Many say , Death ; with what cautious
well @-@ studied phrases and paragraphs they could devise , of explanation ,
of enforcement , of faint recommendation to mercy . Many too say ,
Banishment ; something short of Death . The balance trembles , none can yet
guess whitherward . Whereat anxious Patriotism bellows ; irrepressible by
Ushers .

The poor Girondins , many of them , under such fierce bellowing of
Patriotism , say Death ; justifying , motivant , that most miserable word
of theirs by some brief casuistry and jesuitry . Vergniaud himself says ,
Death ; justifying by jesuitry . Rich Lepelletier Saint @-@ Fargeau had been
of the Noblesse , and then of the Patriot Left Side , in the Constituent ;
and had argued and reported , there and elsewhere , not a little , against
Capital Punishment : nevertheless he now says , Death ; a word which may
cost him dear . Manuel did surely rank with the Decided in August last ;
but he has been sinking and backsliding ever since September , and the
scenes of September . In this Convention , above all , no word he could
speak would find favour ; he says now , Banishment ; and in mute wrath
quits the place for ever , -- much hustled in the corridors . Philippe
Egalite votes in his soul and conscience , Death , at the sound of which ,
and of whom , even Patriotism shakes its head ; and there runs a groan
and shudder through this Hall of Doom . Robespierre &apos;s vote cannot be
doubtful ; his speech is long . Men see the figure of shrill Sieyes
ascend ; hardly pausing , passing merely , this figure says , &quot; La Mort sans
phrase , Death without phrases ; &quot; and fares onward and downward . Most
spectral , pandemonial !

And yet if the Reader fancy it of a funereal , sorrowful or even grave
character , he is far mistaken . &apos; The Ushers in the Mountain quarter , &apos;
says Mercier , &apos; had become as Box @-@ openers at the Opera ; &apos; opening and
shutting of Galleries for privileged persons , for &apos; d &apos;Orleans Egalite &apos;s
mistresses , &apos; or other high @-@ dizened women of condition , rustling with
laces and tricolor . Gallant Deputies pass and repass thitherward ,
treating them with ices , refreshments and small @-@ talk ; the high @-@ dizened
heads beck responsive ; some have their card and pin , pricking down the
Ayes and Noes , as at a game of Rouge @-@ et @-@ Noir . Further aloft reigns Mere
Duchesse with her unrouged Amazons ; she cannot be prevented making
long Hahas , when the vote is not La Mort . In these Galleries there is
refection , drinking of wine and brandy &apos; as in open tavern , en pleine
tabagie . &apos; Betting goes on in all coffeehouses of the neighbourhood . But
within doors , fatigue , impatience , uttermost weariness sits now on
all visages ; lighted up only from time to time , by turns of the game .
Members have fallen asleep ; Ushers come and awaken them to vote : other
Members calculate whether they shall not have time to run and dine .
Figures rise , like phantoms , pale in the dusky lamp @-@ light ; utter from
this Tribune , only one word : Death . &apos; Tout est optique , &apos; says Mercier ,
&apos;the world is all an optical shadow . &apos; ( Mercier , Nouveau Paris , vi .
156 @-@ 59 ; Montgaillard , iii . 348 @-@ 87 ; Moore , &amp; c . ) Deep in the Thursday
night , when the Voting is done , and Secretaries are summing it up , sick
Duchatel , more spectral than another , comes borne on a chair , wrapt in
blankets , &apos; in nightgown and nightcap , &apos; to vote for Mercy : one vote it is
thought may turn the scale .

Ah no ! In profoundest silence , President Vergniaud , with a voice full of
sorrow , has to say : &quot; I declare , in the name of the Convention , that the
Punishment it pronounces on Louis Capet is that of Death . &quot; Death by a
small majority of Fifty @-@ three . Nay , if we deduct from the one side , and
add to the other , a certain Twenty @-@ six , who said Death but coupled some
faintest ineffectual surmise of mercy with it , the majority will be but
One .

Death is the sentence : but its execution ? It is not executed yet !
Scarcely is the vote declared when Louis &apos;s Three Advocates enter ; with
Protest in his name , with demand for Delay , for Appeal to the People .
For this do Deseze and Tronchet plead , with brief eloquence : brave old
Malesherbes pleads for it with eloquent want of eloquence , in broken
sentences , in embarrassment and sobs ; that brave time @-@ honoured face ,
with its grey strength , its broad sagacity and honesty , is mastered with
emotion , melts into dumb tears . ( Moniteur in Hist . Parl. xxiii . 210 .
See Boissy d &apos;Anglas , Vie de Malesherbes , ii . 139 . ) -- They reject the
Appeal to the People ; that having been already settled . But as to the
Delay , what they call Sursis , it shall be considered ; shall be voted for
to @-@ morrow : at present we adjourn . Whereupon Patriotism &apos; hisses &apos; from the
Mountain : but a &apos; tyrannical majority &apos; has so decided , and adjourns .

There is still this fourth Vote then , growls indignant Patriotism : -- this
vote , and who knows what other votes , and adjournments of voting ; and
the whole matter still hovering hypothetical ! And at every new vote
those Jesuit Girondins , even they who voted for Death , would so fain
find a loophole ! Patriotism must watch and rage . Tyrannical adjournments
there have been ; one , and now another at midnight on plea of
fatigue , -- all Friday wasted in hesitation and higgling ; in re @-@ counting
of the votes , which are found correct as they stood ! Patriotism bays
fiercer than ever ; Patriotism , by long @-@ watching , has become red @-@ eyed ,
almost rabid .

&quot; Delay : yes or no ? &quot; men do vote it finally , all Saturday , all day and
night . Men &apos;s nerves are worn out , men &apos;s hearts are desperate ; now it
shall end . Vergniaud , spite of the baying , ventures to say Yes , Delay ;
though he had voted Death . Philippe Egalite says , in his soul and
conscience , No . The next Member mounting : &quot; Since Philippe says No , I
for my part say Yes , Moi je dis Oui . &quot; The balance still trembles . Till
finally , at three o &apos;clock on Sunday morning , we have : No Delay , by a
majority of Seventy ; Death within four @-@ and @-@ twenty hours !

Garat Minister of Justice has to go to the Temple , with this stern
message : he ejaculates repeatedly , &quot; Quelle commission affreuse , What a
frightful function ! &quot; ( Biographie des Ministres , p . 157 . ) Louis begs for
a Confessor ; for yet three days of life , to prepare himself to die . The
Confessor is granted ; the three days and all respite are refused .

There is no deliverance , then ? Thick stone walls answer , None -- Has King
Louis no friends ? Men of action , of courage grown desperate , in this his
extreme need ? King Louis &apos;s friends are feeble and far . Not even a voice
in the coffeehouses rises for him . At Meot the Restaurateur &apos;s no Captain
Dampmartin now dines ; or sees death @-@ doing whiskerandoes on furlough
exhibit daggers of improved structure ! Meot &apos;s gallant Royalists on
furlough are far across the Marches ; they are wandering distracted over
the world : or their bones lie whitening Argonne Wood . Only some weak
Priests &apos; leave Pamphlets on all the bournestones , &apos; this night , calling
for a rescue ; calling for the pious women to rise ; or are taken
distributing Pamphlets , and sent to prison . ( See Prudhomme &apos;s Newspaper ,
Revolutions de Paris in Hist . Parl. xxiii . 318 . )

Nay there is one death @-@ doer , of the ancient Meot sort , who , with effort ,
has done even less and worse : slain a Deputy , and set all the Patriotism
of Paris on edge ! It was five on Saturday evening when Lepelletier St.
Fargeau , having given his vote , No Delay , ran over to Fevrier &apos;s in the
Palais Royal to snatch a morsel of dinner . He had dined , and was paying .
A thickset man &apos; with black hair and blue beard , &apos; in a loose kind of
frock , stept up to him ; it was , as Fevrier and the bystanders bethought
them , one Paris of the old King &apos;s @-@ Guard . &quot; Are you Lepelletier ? &quot;
asks he . -- &quot; Yes . &quot; -- &quot; You voted in the King &apos;s Business ? &quot; -- &quot; I voted
Death . &quot; -- &quot; Scelerat , take that ! &quot; cries Paris , flashing out a sabre from
under his frock , and plunging it deep in Lepelletier &apos;s side . Fevrier
clutches him ; but he breaks off ; is gone .

The voter Lepelletier lies dead ; he has expired in great pain , at one
in the morning ; -- two hours before that Vote of no Delay was fully summed
up ! Guardsman Paris is flying over France ; cannot be taken ; will be
found some months after , self @-@ shot in a remote inn . ( Hist . Parl. xxiii .
275 , 318 ; Felix Lepelletier , Vie de Michel Lepelletier son Frere , p .
61 . &amp; c . Felix , with due love of the miraculous , will have it that
the Suicide in the inn was not Paris , but some double @-@ ganger of
his . ) -- Robespierre sees reason to think that Prince d &apos;Artois himself is
privately in Town ; that the Convention will be butchered in the lump .
Patriotism sounds mere wail and vengeance : Santerre doubles and trebles
all his patrols . Pity is lost in rage and fear ; the Convention has
refused the three days of life and all respite .



Chapter 3.2.VIII.

Place de la Revolution .

To this conclusion , then , hast thou come , O hapless , Louis ! The Son of
Sixty Kings is to die on the Scaffold by form of law . Under Sixty Kings
this same form of Law , form of Society , has been fashioning itself
together , these thousand years ; and has become , one way and other , a
most strange Machine . Surely , if needful , it is also frightful this
Machine ; dead , blind ; not what it should be ; which , with swift stroke ,
or by cold slow torture , has wasted the lives and souls of innumerable
men . And behold now a King himself , or say rather Kinghood in his
person , is to expire here in cruel tortures ; -- like a Phalaris shut in
the belly of his own red @-@ heated Brazen Bull ! It is ever so ; and thou
shouldst know it , O haughty tyrannous man : injustice breeds injustice ;
curses and falsehoods do verily &apos; return always home , &apos; wide as they
may wander . Innocent Louis bears the sins of many generations : he too
experiences that man &apos;s tribunal is not in this Earth ; that if he had no
Higher one , it were not well with him .

A King dying by such violence appeals impressively to the imagination ;
as the like must do , and ought to do . And yet at bottom it is not the
King dying , but the Man ! Kingship is a coat ; the grand loss is of the
skin . The man from whom you take his Life , to him can the whole combined
world do more ? Lally went on his hurdle , his mouth filled with a gag .
Miserablest mortals , doomed for picking pockets , have a whole five @-@ act
Tragedy in them , in that dumb pain , as they go to the gallows ,
unregarded ; they consume the cup of trembling down to the lees . For
Kings and for Beggars , for the justly doomed and the unjustly , it is
a hard thing to die . Pity them all : thy utmost pity with all aids and
appliances and throne @-@ and @-@ scaffold contrasts , how far short is it of the
thing pitied !

A Confessor has come ; Abbe Edgeworth , of Irish extraction , whom the King
knew by good report , has come promptly on this solemn mission . Leave
the Earth alone , then , thou hapless King ; it with its malice will go
its way , thou also canst go thine . A hard scene yet remains : the parting
with our loved ones . Kind hearts , environed in the same grim peril with
us ; to be left here ! Let the Reader look with the eyes of Valet Clery ,
through these glass @-@ doors , where also the Municipality watches ; and see
the cruellest of scenes :

&apos;At half @-@ past eight , the door of the ante @-@ room opened : the Queen
appeared first , leading her Son by the hand ; then Madame Royale and
Madame Elizabeth : they all flung themselves into the arms of the King .
Silence reigned for some minutes ; interrupted only by sobs . The Queen
made a movement to lead his Majesty towards the inner room , where M.
Edgeworth was waiting unknown to them : &quot; No , &quot; said the King , &quot; let us go
into the dining @-@ room , it is there only that I can see you . &quot; They entered
there ; I shut the door of it , which was of glass . The King sat down ,
the Queen on his left hand , Madame Elizabeth on his right , Madame Royale
almost in front ; the young Prince remained standing between his Father &apos;s
legs . They all leaned towards him , and often held him embraced . This
scene of woe lasted an hour and three @-@ quarters ; during which we could
hear nothing ; we could see only that always when the King spoke , the
sobbings of the Princesses redoubled , continued for some minutes ; and
that then the King began again to speak . &apos; ( Clery &apos;s Narrative ( London ,
1798 ) , cited in Weber , iii . 312 . ) -- And so our meetings and our partings
do now end ! The sorrows we gave each other ; the poor joys we faithfully
shared , and all our lovings and our sufferings , and confused toilings
under the earthly Sun , are over . Thou good soul , I shall never , never
through all ages of Time , see thee any more ! -- NEVER ! O Reader , knowest
thou that hard word ?

For nearly two hours this agony lasts ; then they tear themselves
asunder . &quot; Promise that you will see us on the morrow . &quot; He promises : -- Ah
yes , yes ; yet once ; and go now , ye loved ones ; cry to God for yourselves
and me ! -- It was a hard scene , but it is over . He will not see them on
the morrow . The Queen in passing through the ante @-@ room glanced at the
Cerberus Municipals ; and with woman &apos;s vehemence , said through her tears ,
&quot; Vous etes tous des scelerats . &quot;

King Louis slept sound , till five in the morning , when Clery , as he
had been ordered , awoke him . Clery dressed his hair . While this went
forward , Louis took a ring from his watch , and kept trying it on his
finger ; it was his wedding @-@ ring , which he is now to return to the
Queen as a mute farewell . At half @-@ past six , he took the Sacrament ; and
continued in devotion , and conference with Abbe Edgeworth . He will not
see his Family : it were too hard to bear .

At eight , the Municipals enter : the King gives them his Will and
messages and effects ; which they , at first , brutally refuse to
take charge of : he gives them a roll of gold pieces , a hundred and
twenty @-@ five louis ; these are to be returned to Malesherbes , who had
lent them . At nine , Santerre says the hour is come . The King begs yet
to retire for three minutes . At the end of three minutes , Santerre again
says the hour is come . &apos; Stamping on the ground with his right foot ,
Louis answers : &quot; Partons , let us go . &quot; &apos; -- How the rolling of those drums
comes in , through the Temple bastions and bulwarks , on the heart of a
queenly wife ; soon to be a widow ! He is gone , then , and has not seen
us ? A Queen weeps bitterly ; a King &apos;s Sister and Children . Over all these
Four does Death also hover : all shall perish miserably save one ; she , as
Duchesse d &apos;Angouleme , will live , -- not happily .

At the Temple Gate were some faint cries , perhaps from voices of pitiful
women : &quot; Grace ! Grace ! &quot; Through the rest of the streets there is silence
as of the grave . No man not armed is allowed to be there : the armed ,
did any even pity , dare not express it , each man overawed by all his
neighbours . All windows are down , none seen looking through them . All
shops are shut . No wheel @-@ carriage rolls this morning , in these streets
but one only . Eighty thousand armed men stand ranked , like armed statues
of men ; cannons bristle , cannoneers with match burning , but no word or
movement : it is as a city enchanted into silence and stone ; one carriage
with its escort , slowly rumbling , is the only sound . Louis reads , in his
Book of Devotion , the Prayers of the Dying : clatter of this death @-@ march
falls sharp on the ear , in the great silence ; but the thought would fain
struggle heavenward , and forget the Earth .

As the clocks strike ten , behold the Place de la Revolution , once Place
de Louis Quinze : the Guillotine , mounted near the old Pedestal where
once stood the Statue of that Louis ! Far round , all bristles with
cannons and armed men : spectators crowding in the rear ; d &apos;Orleans
Egalite there in cabriolet . Swift messengers , hoquetons , speed to
the Townhall , every three minutes : near by is the Convention
sitting , -- vengeful for Lepelletier . Heedless of all , Louis reads his
Prayers of the Dying ; not till five minutes yet has he finished ; then
the Carriage opens . What temper he is in ? Ten different witnesses
will give ten different accounts of it . He is in the collision of all
tempers ; arrived now at the black Mahlstrom and descent of Death : in
sorrow , in indignation , in resignation struggling to be resigned . &quot; Take
care of M. Edgeworth , &quot; he straitly charges the Lieutenant who is sitting
with them : then they two descend .

The drums are beating : &quot; Taisez @-@ vous , Silence ! &quot; he cries &apos; in a terrible
voice , d &apos;une voix terrible . &apos; He mounts the scaffold , not without delay ;
he is in puce coat , breeches of grey , white stockings . He strips off
the coat ; stands disclosed in a sleeve @-@ waistcoat of white flannel . The
Executioners approach to bind him : he spurns , resists ; Abbe Edgeworth
has to remind him how the Saviour , in whom men trust , submitted to be
bound . His hands are tied , his head bare ; the fatal moment is come . He
advances to the edge of the Scaffold , &apos; his face very red , &apos; and says :
&quot; Frenchmen , I die innocent : it is from the Scaffold and near appearing
before God that I tell you so . I pardon my enemies ; I desire that
France -- &quot; A General on horseback , Santerre or another , prances out with
uplifted hand : &quot; Tambours ! &quot; The drums drown the voice . &quot; Executioners do
your duty ! &quot; The Executioners , desperate lest themselves be murdered ( for
Santerre and his Armed Ranks will strike , if they do not ) , seize the
hapless Louis : six of them desperate , him singly desperate , struggling
there ; and bind him to their plank . Abbe Edgeworth , stooping , bespeaks
him : &quot; Son of Saint Louis , ascend to Heaven . &quot; The Axe clanks down ; a
King &apos;s Life is shorn away . It is Monday the 21st of January 1793 . He was
aged Thirty @-@ eight years four months and twenty @-@ eight days . ( Newspapers ,
Municipal Records , &amp; c . &amp; c. in Hist . Parl. xxiii . 298 @-@ 349 ) Deux Amis
( ix . 369 @-@ 373 ) , Mercier ( Nouveau Paris , iii . 3 @-@ 8 . )

Executioner Samson shews the Head : fierce shout of Vive la Republique
rises , and swells ; caps raised on bayonets , hats waving : students of
the College of Four Nations take it up , on the far Quais ; fling it over
Paris . Orleans drives off in his cabriolet ; the Townhall Councillors
rub their hands , saying , &quot; It is done , It is done . &quot; There is dipping of
handkerchiefs , of pike @-@ points in the blood . Headsman Samson , though he
afterwards denied it , ( His Letter in the Newspapers , Hist . Parl. ubi
supra . ) sells locks of the hair : fractions of the puce coat are long
after worn in rings . ( Forster &apos;s Briefwechsel , i . 473 . ) -- And so , in some
half @-@ hour it is done ; and the multitude has all departed . Pastrycooks ,
coffee @-@ sellers , milkmen sing out their trivial quotidian cries : the
world wags on , as if this were a common day . In the coffeehouses that
evening , says Prudhomme , Patriot shook hands with Patriot in a more
cordial manner than usual . Not till some days after , according to
Mercier , did public men see what a grave thing it was .

A grave thing it indisputably is ; and will have consequences . On the
morrow morning , Roland , so long steeped to the lips in disgust and
chagrin , sends in his demission . His accounts lie all ready , correct
in black @-@ on @-@ white to the uttermost farthing : these he wants but to have
audited , that he might retire to remote obscurity to the country and
his books . They will never be audited those accounts ; he will never get
retired thither .

It was on Tuesday that Roland demitted . On Thursday comes Lepelletier
St. Fargeau &apos;s Funeral , and passage to the Pantheon of Great Men . Notable
as the wild pageant of a winter day . The Body is borne aloft , half @-@ bare ;
the winding sheet disclosing the death @-@ wound : sabre and bloody
clothes parade themselves ; a &apos; lugubrious music &apos; wailing harsh naeniae .
Oak @-@ crowns shower down from windows ; President Vergniaud walks there ,
with Convention , with Jacobin Society , and all Patriots of every colour ,
all mourning brotherlike .

Notable also for another thing , this Burial of Lepelletier : it was the
last act these men ever did with concert ! All Parties and figures of
Opinion , that agitate this distracted France and its Convention , now
stand , as it were , face to face , and dagger to dagger ; the King &apos;s Life ,
round which they all struck and battled , being hurled down . Dumouriez ,
conquering Holland , growls ominous discontent , at the head of Armies .
Men say Dumouriez will have a King ; that young d &apos;Orleans Egalite shall
be his King . Deputy Fauchet , in the Journal des Amis , curses his day ,
more bitterly than Job did ; invokes the poniards of Regicides , of &apos; Arras
Vipers &apos; or Robespierres , of Pluto Dantons , of horrid Butchers Legendre
and Simulacra d &apos;Herbois , to send him swiftly to another world than
theirs . ( Hist . Parl. ubi supra . ) This is Te @-@ Deum Fauchet , of the
Bastille Victory , of the Cercle Social . Sharp was the death @-@ hail
rattling round one &apos;s Flag @-@ of @-@ truce , on that Bastille day : but it was
soft to such wreckage of high Hope as this ; one &apos;s New Golden Era going
down in leaden dross , and sulphurous black of the Everlasting Darkness !

At home this Killing of a King has divided all friends ; and abroad
it has united all enemies . Fraternity of Peoples , Revolutionary
Propagandism ; Atheism , Regicide ; total destruction of social order in
this world ! All Kings , and lovers of Kings , and haters of Anarchy ,
rank in coalition ; as in a war for life . England signifies to Citizen
Chauvelin , the Ambassador or rather Ambassador &apos;s @-@ Cloak , that he must
quit the country in eight days . Ambassador &apos;s @-@ Cloak and Ambassador ,
Chauvelin and Talleyrand , depart accordingly . ( Annual Register of
1793 , pp. 114 @-@ 128 . ) Talleyrand , implicated in that Iron Press of the
Tuileries , thinks it safest to make for America .

England has cast out the Embassy : England declares war , -- being shocked
principally , it would seem , at the condition of the River Scheldt .
Spain declares war ; being shocked principally at some other thing ;
which doubtless the Manifesto indicates . ( 23d March , Annual Register , p .
161 . ) Nay we find it was not England that declared war first , or Spain
first ; but that France herself declared war first on both of them ; ( 1st
February ; 7th March , Moniteur of these dates . ) -- a point of immense
Parliamentary and Journalistic interest in those days , but which has
become of no interest whatever in these . They all declare war . The sword
is drawn , the scabbard thrown away . It is even as Danton said , in one of
his all @-@ too gigantic figures : &quot; The coalised Kings threaten us ; we hurl
at their feet , as gage of battle , the Head of a King . &quot;




BOOK 3.III.

THE GIRONDINS


Chapter 3.3.I.

Cause and Effect .

This huge Insurrectionary Movement , which we liken to a breaking out of
Tophet and the Abyss , has swept away Royalty , Aristocracy , and a King &apos;s
life . The question is , What will it next do ; how will it henceforth
shape itself ? Settle down into a reign of Law and Liberty ; according
as the habits , persuasions and endeavours of the educated , monied ,
respectable class prescribe ? That is to say : the volcanic lava @-@ flood ,
bursting up in the manner described , will explode and flow according to
Girondin Formula and pre @-@ established rule of Philosophy ? If so , for our
Girondin friends it will be well .

Meanwhile were not the prophecy rather that as no external force , Royal
or other , now remains which could control this Movement , the Movement
will follow a course of its own ; probably a very original one ? Further ,
that whatsoever man or men can best interpret the inward tendencies it
has , and give them voice and activity , will obtain the lead of it ? For
the rest , that as a thing without order , a thing proceeding from beyond
and beneath the region of order , it must work and welter , not as a
Regularity but as a Chaos ; destructive and self @-@ destructive ; always till
something that has order arise , strong enough to bind it into subjection
again ? Which something , we may further conjecture , will not be a
Formula , with philosophical propositions and forensic eloquence ; but a
Reality , probably with a sword in its hand !

As for the Girondin Formula , of a respectable Republic for the Middle
Classes , all manner of Aristocracies being now sufficiently demolished ,
there seems little reason to expect that the business will stop there .
Liberty , Equality , Fraternity , these are the words ; enunciative and
prophetic . Republic for the respectable washed Middle Classes , how can
that be the fulfilment thereof ? Hunger and nakedness , and nightmare
oppression lying heavy on Twenty @-@ five million hearts ; this , not
the wounded vanities or contradicted philosophies of philosophical
Advocates , rich Shopkeepers , rural Noblesse , was the prime mover in the
French Revolution ; as the like will be in all such Revolutions , in all
countries . Feudal Fleur @-@ de @-@ lys had become an insupportably bad marching
banner , and needed to be torn and trampled : but Moneybag of Mammon ( for
that , in these times , is what the respectable Republic for the Middle
Classes will signify ) is a still worse , while it lasts . Properly ,
indeed , it is the worst and basest of all banners , and symbols of
dominion among men ; and indeed is possible only in a time of general
Atheism , and Unbelief in any thing save in brute Force and Sensualism ;
pride of birth , pride of office , any known kind of pride being a degree
better than purse @-@ pride . Freedom , Equality , Brotherhood : not in the
Moneybag , but far elsewhere , will Sansculottism seek these things .

We say therefore that an Insurrectionary France , loose of control from
without , destitute of supreme order from within , will form one of the
most tumultuous Activities ever seen on this Earth ; such as no Girondin
Formula can regulate . An immeasurable force , made up of forces manifold ,
heterogeneous , compatible and incompatible . In plainer words , this
France must needs split into Parties ; each of which seeking to make
itself good , contradiction , exasperation will arise ; and Parties on
Parties find that they cannot work together , cannot exist together .

As for the number of Parties , there will , strictly counting , be as many
Parties as there are Opinions . According to which rule , in this National
Convention itself , to say nothing of France generally , the number
of Parties ought to be Seven Hundred and Forty @-@ Nine ; for every unit
entertains his opinion . But now as every unit has at once an individual
nature , or necessity to follow his own road , and a gregarious nature
or necessity to see himself travelling by the side of others , -- what
can there be but dissolutions , precipitations , endless turbulence of
attracting and repelling ; till once the master @-@ element get evolved , and
this wild alchemy arrange itself again ?

To the length of Seven Hundred and Forty @-@ nine Parties , however , no
Nation was ever yet seen to go . Nor indeed much beyond the length of Two
Parties ; two at a time ; -- so invincible is man &apos;s tendency to unite , with
all the invincible divisiveness he has ! Two Parties , we say , are the
usual number at one time : let these two fight it out , all minor shades
of party rallying under the shade likest them ; when the one has fought
down the other , then it , in its turn , may divide , self @-@ destructive ;
and so the process continue , as far as needful . This is the way of
Revolutions , which spring up as the French one has done ; when the
so @-@ called Bonds of Society snap asunder ; and all Laws that are not Laws
of Nature become naught and Formulas merely .

But quitting these somewhat abstract considerations , let History note
this concrete reality which the streets of Paris exhibit , on Monday the
25th of February 1793 . Long before daylight that morning , these streets
are noisy and angry . Petitioning enough there has been ; a Convention
often solicited . It was but yesterday there came a Deputation of
Washerwomen with Petition ; complaining that not so much as soap could be
had ; to say nothing of bread , and condiments of bread . The cry of women ,
round the Salle de Manege , was heard plaintive : &quot; Du pain et du savon ,
Bread and Soap . &quot; ( Moniteur &amp; c . Hist . Parl. xxiv . 332 @-@ 348 . )

And now from six o &apos;clock , this Monday morning , one perceives the Baker &apos;s
Queues unusually expanded , angrily agitating themselves . Not the Baker
alone , but two Section Commissioners to help him , manage with difficulty
the daily distribution of loaves . Soft @-@ spoken assiduous , in the early
candle @-@ light , are Baker and Commissioners : and yet the pale chill
February sunrise discloses an unpromising scene . Indignant Female
Patriots , partly supplied with bread , rush now to the shops , declaring
that they will have groceries . Groceries enough : sugar @-@ barrels rolled
forth into the street , Patriot Citoyennes weighing it out at a just
rate of eleven @-@ pence a pound ; likewise coffee @-@ chests , soap @-@ chests ,
nay cinnamon and cloves @-@ chests , with aquavitae and other forms of
alcohol , -- at a just rate , which some do not pay ; the pale @-@ faced Grocer
silently wringing his hands ! What help ? The distributive Citoyennes are
of violent speech and gesture , their long Eumenides &apos; hair hanging out of
curl ; nay in their girdles pistols are seen sticking : some , it is even
said , have beards , -- male Patriots in petticoats and mob @-@ cap . Thus ,
in the streets of Lombards , in the street of Five @-@ Diamonds , street of
Pullies , in most streets of Paris does it effervesce , the livelong day ;
no Municipality , no Mayor Pache , though he was War @-@ Minister lately ,
sends military against it , or aught against it but persuasive @-@ eloquence ,
till seven at night , or later .

On Monday gone five weeks , which was the twenty @-@ first of January , we
saw Paris , beheading its King , stand silent , like a petrified City
of Enchantment : and now on this Monday it is so noisy , selling
sugar ! Cities , especially Cities in Revolution , are subject to these
alternations ; the secret courses of civic business and existence
effervescing and efflorescing , in this manner , as a concrete Phenomenon
to the eye . Of which Phenomenon , when secret existence becoming public
effloresces on the street , the philosophical cause @-@ and @-@ effect is not
so easy to find . What , for example , may be the accurate philosophical
meaning , and meanings , of this sale of sugar ? These things that have
become visible in the street of Pullies and over Paris , whence are they ,
we say ; and whither ? --

That Pitt has a hand in it , the gold of Pitt : so much , to all reasonable
Patriot men , may seem clear . But then , through what agents of Pitt ?
Varlet , Apostle of Liberty , was discerned again of late , with his pike
and his red nightcap . Deputy Marat published in his journal , this very
day , complaining of the bitter scarcity , and sufferings of the people ,
till he seemed to get wroth : &apos; If your Rights of Man were anything but a
piece of written paper , the plunder of a few shops , and a forestaller
or two hung up at the door @-@ lintels , would put an end to such things . &apos; 
( Hist . Parl. xxiv . 353 @-@ 356 . ) Are not these , say the Girondins , pregnant
indications ? Pitt has bribed the Anarchists ; Marat is the agent of Pitt :
hence this sale of sugar . To the Mother Society , again , it is clear that
the scarcity is factitious ; is the work of Girondins , and such like ; a
set of men sold partly to Pitt ; sold wholly to their own ambitions , and
hard @-@ hearted pedantries ; who will not fix the grain @-@ prices , but prate
pedantically of free @-@ trade ; wishing to starve Paris into violence , and
embroil it with the Departments : hence this sale of sugar .

And , alas , if to these two notabilities , of a Phenomenon and such
Theories of a Phenomenon , we add this third notability , That the French
Nation has believed , for several years now , in the possibility , nay
certainty and near advent , of a universal Millennium , or reign of
Freedom , Equality , Fraternity , wherein man should be the brother of man ,
and sorrow and sin flee away ? Not bread to eat , nor soap to wish with ;
and the reign of perfect Felicity ready to arrive , due always since
the Bastille fell ! How did our hearts burn within us , at that Feast
of Pikes , when brother flung himself on brother &apos;s bosom ; and in sunny
jubilee , Twenty @-@ five millions burst forth into sound and cannon @-@ smoke !
Bright was our Hope then , as sunlight ; red @-@ angry is our Hope grown now ,
as consuming fire . But , O Heavens , what enchantment is it , or devilish
legerdemain , of such effect , that Perfect Felicity , always within arm &apos;s
length , could never be laid hold of , but only in her stead Controversy
and Scarcity ? This set of traitors after that set ! Tremble , ye traitors ;
dread a People which calls itself patient , long @-@ suffering ; but which
cannot always submit to have its pocket picked , in this way , -- of a
Millennium !

Yes , Reader , here is a miracle . Out of that putrescent rubbish of
Scepticism , Sensualism , Sentimentalism , hollow Machiavelism , such
a Faith has verily risen ; flaming in the heart of a People . A whole
People , awakening as it were to consciousness in deep misery , believes
that it is within reach of a Fraternal Heaven @-@ on @-@ Earth . With longing
arms , it struggles to embrace the Unspeakable ; cannot embrace it , owing
to certain causes . -- Seldom do we find that a whole People can be said
to have any Faith at all ; except in things which it can eat and handle .
Whensoever it gets any Faith , its history becomes spirit @-@ stirring ,
note @-@ worthy . But since the time when steel Europe shook itself
simultaneously , at the word of Hermit Peter , and rushed towards the
Sepulchre where God had lain , there was no universal impulse of Faith
that one could note . Since Protestantism went silent , no Luther &apos;s voice ,
no Zisca &apos;s drum any longer proclaiming that God &apos;s Truth was not the
Devil &apos;s Lie ; and the last of the Cameronians ( Renwick was the name of
him ; honour to the name of the brave ! ) sank , shot , on the Castle Hill
of Edinburgh , there was no partial impulse of Faith among Nations . Till
now , behold , once more this French Nation believes ! Herein , we say ,
in that astonishing Faith of theirs , lies the miracle . It is a Faith
undoubtedly of the more prodigious sort , even among Faiths ; and will
embody itself in prodigies . It is the soul of that world @-@ prodigy named
French Revolution ; whereat the world still gazes and shudders .

But , for the rest , let no man ask History to explain by cause @-@ and @-@ effect
how the business proceeded henceforth . This battle of Mountain and
Gironde , and what follows , is the battle of Fanaticisms and Miracles ;
unsuitable for cause @-@ and @-@ effect . The sound of it , to the mind , is as a
hubbub of voices in distraction ; little of articulate is to be gathered
by long listening and studying ; only battle @-@ tumult , shouts of triumph ,
shrieks of despair . The Mountain has left no Memoirs ; the Girondins
have left Memoirs , which are too often little other than long @-@ drawn
Interjections , of Woe is me and Cursed be ye . So soon as History can
philosophically delineate the conflagration of a kindled Fireship ,
she may try this other task . Here lay the bitumen @-@ stratum , there the
brimstone one ; so ran the vein of gunpowder , of nitre , terebinth and
foul grease : this , were she inquisitive enough , History might partly
know . But how they acted and reacted below decks , one fire @-@ stratum
playing into the other , by its nature and the art of man , now when all
hands ran raging , and the flames lashed high over shrouds and topmast :
this let not History attempt .

The Fireship is old France , the old French Form of Life ; her creed a
Generation of men . Wild are their cries and their ragings there , like
spirits tormented in that flame . But , on the whole , are they not gone ,
O Reader ? Their Fireship and they , frightening the world , have sailed
away ; its flames and its thunders quite away , into the Deep of Time . One
thing therefore History will do : pity them all ; for it went hard with
them all . Not even the seagreen Incorruptible but shall have some
pity , some human love , though it takes an effort . And now , so much once
thoroughly attained , the rest will become easier . To the eye of
equal brotherly pity , innumerable perversions dissipate themselves ;
exaggerations and execrations fall off , of their own accord . Standing
wistfully on the safe shore , we will look , and see , what is of interest
to us , what is adapted to us .



Chapter 3.3.II.

Culottic and Sansculottic .

Gironde and Mountain are now in full quarrel ; their mutual rage , says
Toulongeon , is growing a &apos; pale &apos; rage . Curious , lamentable : all these men
have the word Republic on their lips ; in the heart of every one of them
is a passionate wish for something which he calls Republic : yet see
their death @-@ quarrel ! So , however , are men made . Creatures who live
in confusion ; who , once thrown together , can readily fall into
that confusion of confusions which quarrel is , simply because their
confusions differ from one another ; still more because they seem to
differ ! Men &apos;s words are a poor exponent of their thought ; nay their
thought itself is a poor exponent of the inward unnamed Mystery ,
wherefrom both thought and action have their birth . No man can explain
himself , can get himself explained ; men see not one another but
distorted phantasms which they call one another ; which they hate and go
to battle with : for all battle is well said to be misunderstanding .

But indeed that similitude of the Fireship ; of our poor French brethren ,
so fiery themselves , working also in an element of fire , was not
insignificant . Consider it well , there is a shade of the truth in
it . For a man , once committed headlong to republican or any other
Transcendentalism , and fighting and fanaticising amid a Nation of
his like , becomes as it were enveloped in an ambient atmosphere of
Transcendentalism and Delirium : his individual self is lost in something
that is not himself , but foreign though inseparable from him . Strange to
think of , the man &apos;s cloak still seems to hold the same man : and yet the
man is not there , his volition is not there ; nor the source of what he
will do and devise ; instead of the man and his volition there is a
piece of Fanaticism and Fatalism incarnated in the shape of him . He , the
hapless incarnated Fanaticism , goes his road ; no man can help him , he
himself least of all . It is a wonderful tragical predicament ; -- such as
human language , unused to deal with these things , being contrived for
the uses of common life , struggles to shadow out in figures . The ambient
element of material fire is not wilder than this of Fanaticism ; nor ,
though visible to the eye , is it more real . Volition bursts forth
involuntary ; rapt along ; the movement of free human minds becomes
a raging tornado of fatalism , blind as the winds ; and Mountain and
Gironde , when they recover themselves , are alike astounded to see where
it has flung and dropt them . To such height of miracle can men work on
men ; the Conscious and the Unconscious blended inscrutably in this our
inscrutable Life ; endless Necessity environing Freewill !

The weapons of the Girondins are Political Philosophy , Respectability
and Eloquence . Eloquence , or call it rhetoric , really of a superior
order ; Vergniaud , for instance , turns a period as sweetly as any man of
that generation . The weapons of the Mountain are those of mere nature :
Audacity and Impetuosity which may become Ferocity , as of men complete
in their determination , in their conviction ; nay of men , in some cases ,
who as Septemberers must either prevail or perish . The ground to be
fought for is Popularity : further you may either seek Popularity with
the friends of Freedom and Order , or with the friends of Freedom Simple ;
to seek it with both has unhappily become impossible . With the former
sort , and generally with the Authorities of the Departments , and such
as read Parliamentary Debates , and are of Respectability , and of a
peace @-@ loving monied nature , the Girondins carry it . With the extreme
Patriot again , with the indigent millions , especially with the
Population of Paris who do not read so much as hear and see , the
Girondins altogether lose it , and the Mountain carries it .

Egoism , nor meanness of mind , is not wanting on either side . Surely not
on the Girondin side ; where in fact the instinct of self @-@ preservation ,
too prominently unfolded by circumstances , cuts almost a sorry figure ;
where also a certain finesse , to the length even of shuffling
and shamming , now and then shews itself . They are men skilful in
Advocate @-@ fence . They have been called the Jesuits of the Revolution ;
( Dumouriez , Memoires , iii . 314 . ) but that is too hard a name . It must be
owned likewise that this rude blustering Mountain has a sense in it of
what the Revolution means ; which these eloquent Girondins are totally
void of . Was the Revolution made , and fought for , against the world ,
these four weary years , that a Formula might be substantiated ; that
Society might become methodic , demonstrable by logic ; and the old
Noblesse with their pretensions vanish ? Or ought it not withal to bring
some glimmering of light and alleviation to the Twenty @-@ five Millions ,
who sat in darkness , heavy @-@ laden , till they rose with pikes in their
hands ? At least and lowest , one would think , it should bring them a
proportion of bread to live on ? There is in the Mountain here and there ;
in Marat People &apos;s @-@ friend ; in the incorruptible Seagreen himself , though
otherwise so lean and formularly , a heartfelt knowledge of this latter
fact ; -- without which knowledge all other knowledge here is naught , and
the choicest forensic eloquence is as sounding brass and a tinkling
cymbal . Most cold , on the other hand , most patronising , unsubstantial is
the tone of the Girondins towards &apos; our poorer brethren ; &apos; -- those brethren
whom one often hears of under the collective name of &apos; the masses , &apos; as
if they were not persons at all , but mounds of combustible explosive
material , for blowing down Bastilles with ! In very truth , a
Revolutionist of this kind , is he not a Solecism ? Disowned by Nature and
Art ; deserving only to be erased , and disappear ! Surely , to our poorer
brethren of Paris , all this Girondin patronage sounds deadening and
killing : if fine @-@ spoken and incontrovertible in logic , then all the
falser , all the hatefuller in fact .

Nay doubtless , pleading for Popularity , here among our poorer brethren
of Paris , the Girondin has a hard game to play . If he gain the ear of
the Respectable at a distance , it is by insisting on September and such
like ; it is at the expense of this Paris where he dwells and perorates .
Hard to perorate in such an auditory ! Wherefore the question arises :
Could we not get ourselves out of this Paris ? Twice or oftener such an
attempt is made . If not we ourselves , thinks Guadet , then at least
our Suppleans might do it . For every Deputy has his Suppleant , or
Substitute , who will take his place if need be : might not these
assemble , say at Bourges , which is a quiet episcopal Town , in quiet
Berri , forty good leagues off ? In that case , what profit were it for
the Paris Sansculottery to insult us ; our Suppleans sitting quiet
in Bourges , to whom we could run ? Nay even the Primary electoral
Assemblies , thinks Guadet , might be reconvoked , and a New Convention
got , with new orders from the Sovereign people ; and right glad were
Lyons , were Bourdeaux , Rouen , Marseilles , as yet Provincial Towns , to
welcome us in their turn , and become a sort of Capital Towns ; and teach
these Parisians reason .

Fond schemes ; which all misgo ! If decreed , in heat of eloquent
logic , to @-@ day , they are repealed , by clamour , and passionate wider
considerations , on the morrow . ( Moniteur , 1793 , No. 140 , &amp; c . ) Will you ,
O Girondins , parcel us into separate Republics , then ; like the Swiss ,
like your Americans ; so that there be no Metropolis or indivisible
French Nation any more ? Your Departmental Guard seemed to point that
way ! Federal Republic ? Federalist ? Men and Knitting @-@ women repeat
Federaliste , with or without much Dictionary @-@ meaning ; but go on
repeating it , as is usual in such cases , till the meaning of it
becomes almost magical , fit to designate all mystery of Iniquity ;
and Federaliste has grown a word of Exorcism and Apage @-@ Satanas .
But furthermore , consider what &apos; poisoning of public opinion &apos; in the
Departments , by these Brissot , Gorsas , Caritat @-@ Condorcet Newspapers !
And then also what counter @-@ poisoning , still feller in quality , by a Pere
Duchesne of Hebert , brutallest Newspaper yet published on Earth ; by a
Rougiff of Guffroy ; by the &apos; incendiary leaves of Marat ! &apos; More than once ,
on complaint given and effervescence rising , it is decreed that a man
cannot both be Legislator and Editor ; that he shall choose between the
one function and the other . ( Hist . Parl. xxv . 25 , &amp; c . ) But this too ,
which indeed could help little , is revoked or eluded ; remains a pious
wish mainly .

Meanwhile , as the sad fruit of such strife , behold , O ye National
Representatives , how between the friends of Law and the friends of
Freedom everywhere , mere heats and jealousies have arisen ; fevering the
whole Republic ! Department , Provincial Town is set against Metropolis ,
Rich against Poor , Culottic against Sansculottic , man against man . From
the Southern Cities come Addresses of an almost inculpatory character ;
for Paris has long suffered Newspaper calumny . Bourdeaux demands a
reign of Law and Respectability , meaning Girondism , with emphasis . With
emphasis Marseilles demands the like . Nay from Marseilles there come two
Addresses : one Girondin ; one Jacobin Sansculottic . Hot Rebecqui , sick of
this Convention @-@ work , has given place to his Substitute , and gone home ;
where also , with such jarrings , there is work to be sick of .

Lyons , a place of Capitalists and Aristocrats , is in still worse state ;
almost in revolt . Chalier the Jacobin Town @-@ Councillor has got , too
literally , to daggers @-@ drawn with Nievre @-@ Chol the Moderantin Mayor ; one
of your Moderate , perhaps Aristocrat , Royalist or Federalist Mayors !
Chalier , who pilgrimed to Paris &apos; to behold Marat and the Mountain , &apos; has
verily kindled himself at their sacred urn : for on the 6th of February
last , History or Rumour has seen him haranguing his Lyons Jacobins in
a quite transcendental manner , with a drawn dagger in his hand ;
recommending ( they say ) sheer September @-@ methods , patience being
worn out ; and that the Jacobin Brethren should , impromptu , work the
Guillotine themselves ! One sees him still , in Engravings : mounted on
a table ; foot advanced , body contorted ; a bald , rude , slope @-@ browed ,
infuriated visage of the canine species , the eyes starting from
their sockets ; in his puissant right @-@ hand the brandished dagger , or
horse @-@ pistol , as some give it ; other dog @-@ visages kindling under him : -- a
man not likely to end well ! However , the Guillotine was not got together
impromptu , that day , &apos; on the Pont Saint @-@ Clair , &apos; or elsewhere ; but indeed
continued lying rusty in its loft : ( Hist . Parl. xxiv . 385 @-@ 93 ; xxvi . 229,
&amp; c . ) Nievre @-@ Chol with military went about , rumbling cannon , in the most
confused manner ; and the &apos; nine hundred prisoners &apos; received no hurt .
So distracted is Lyons grown , with its cannon rumbling . Convention
Commissioners must be sent thither forthwith : if even they can appease
it , and keep the Guillotine in its loft ?

Consider finally if , on all these mad jarrings of the Southern Cities ,
and of France generally , a traitorous Crypto @-@ Royalist class is not
looking and watching ; ready to strike in , at the right season ! Neither
is there bread ; neither is there soap : see the Patriot women selling
out sugar , at a just rate of twenty @-@ two sous per pound ! Citizen
Representatives , it were verily well that your quarrels finished , and
the reign of Perfect Felicity began .



Chapter 3.3.III.

Growing shrill .

On the whole , one cannot say that the Girondins are wanting to
themselves , so far as good @-@ will might go . They prick assiduously
into the sore @-@ places of the Mountain ; from principle , and also from
jesuitism .

Besides September , of which there is now little to be made except
effervescence , we discern two sore @-@ places where the Mountain often
suffers : Marat and Orleans Egalite . Squalid Marat , for his own sake and
for the Mountain &apos;s , is assaulted ever and anon ; held up to France , as a
squalid bloodthirsty Portent , inciting to the pillage of shops ; of whom
let the Mountain have the credit ! The Mountain murmurs , ill at ease :
this &apos; Maximum of Patriotism , &apos; how shall they either own him or
disown him ? As for Marat personally , he , with his fixed @-@ idea , remains
invulnerable to such things : nay the People &apos;s @-@ friend is very evidently
rising in importance , as his befriended People rises . No shrieks now ,
when he goes to speak ; occasional applauses rather , furtherance which
breeds confidence . The day when the Girondins proposed to &apos; decree him
accused &apos; ( decreter d &apos;accusation , as they phrase it ) for that February
Paragraph , of &apos; hanging up a Forestaller or two at the door @-@ lintels , &apos;
Marat proposes to have them &apos; decreed insane ; &apos; and , descending
the Tribune @-@ steps , is heard to articulate these most unsenatorial
ejaculations : &quot; Les Cochons , les imbecilles , Pigs , idiots ! &quot; Oftentimes he
croaks harsh sarcasm , having really a rough rasping tongue , and a very
deep fund of contempt for fine outsides ; and once or twice , he even
laughs , nay &apos; explodes into laughter , rit aux eclats , &apos; at the gentilities
and superfine airs of these Girondin &quot; men of statesmanship , &quot; with their
pedantries , plausibilities , pusillanimities : &quot; these two years , &quot; says he ,
&quot; you have been whining about attacks , and plots , and danger from Paris ;
and you have not a scratch to shew for yourselves . &quot; ( Moniteur , Seance du
20 Mai 1793 . ) -- Danton gruffly rebukes him , from time to time : a Maximum
of Patriotism , whom one can neither own nor disown !

But the second sore @-@ place of the Mountain is this anomalous Monseigneur
Equality Prince d &apos;Orleans . Behold these men , says the Gironde ; with a
whilom Bourbon Prince among them : they are creatures of the d &apos;Orleans
Faction ; they will have Philippe made King ; one King no sooner
guillotined than another made in his stead ! Girondins have moved , Buzot
moved long ago , from principle and also from jesuitism , that the whole
race of Bourbons should be marched forth from the soil of France ; this
Prince Egalite to bring up the rear . Motions which might produce some
effect on the public ; -- which the Mountain , ill at ease , knows not what
to do with .

And poor Orleans Egalite himself , for one begins to pity even him , what
does he do with them ? The disowned of all parties , the rejected and
foolishly be @-@ drifted hither and hither , to what corner of Nature can he
now drift with advantage ? Feasible hope remains not for him : unfeasible
hope , in pallid doubtful glimmers , there may still come , bewildering ,
not cheering or illuminating , -- from the Dumouriez quarter ; and how ,
if not the timewasted Orleans Egalite , then perhaps the young unworn
Chartres Egalite might rise to be a kind of King ? Sheltered , if shelter
it be , in the clefts of the Mountain , poor Egalite will wait : one refuge
in Jacobinism , one in Dumouriez and Counter @-@ Revolution , are there
not two chances ? However , the look of him , Dame Genlis says , is grown
gloomy ; sad to see . Sillery also , the Genlis &apos;s Husband , who hovers
about the Mountain , not on it , is in a bad way . Dame Genlis has come
to Raincy , out of England and Bury St. Edmunds , in these days ; being
summoned by Egalite , with her young charge , Mademoiselle Egalite , that
so Mademoiselle might not be counted among Emigrants and hardly dealt
with . But it proves a ravelled business : Genlis and charge find that
they must retire to the Netherlands ; must wait on the Frontiers for a
week or two ; till Monseigneur , by Jacobin help , get it wound up . &apos; Next
morning , &apos; says Dame Genlis , &apos; Monseigneur , gloomier than ever , gave
me his arm , to lead me to the carriage . I was greatly troubled ;
Mademoiselle burst into tears ; her Father was pale and trembling . After
I had got seated , he stood immovable at the carriage @-@ door , with his
eyes fixed on me ; his mournful and painful look seemed to implore
pity ; -- &quot; Adieu , Madame ! &quot; said he . The altered sound of his voice
completely overcame me ; not able to utter a word , I held out my hand ;
he grasped it close ; then turning , and advancing sharply towards the
postillions , he gave them a sign , and we rolled away . &apos; ( Genlis , Memoires
( London , 1825 ) , iv . 118 . )

Nor are Peace @-@ makers wanting ; of whom likewise we mention two ; one
fast on the crown of the Mountain , the other not yet alighted anywhere :
Danton and Barrere . Ingenious Barrere , Old @-@ Constituent and Editor
from the slopes of the Pyrenees , is one of the usefullest men of this
Convention , in his way . Truth may lie on both sides , on either side ,
or on neither side ; my friends , ye must give and take : for the rest ,
success to the winning side ! This is the motto of Barrere . Ingenious ,
almost genial ; quick @-@ sighted , supple , graceful ; a man that will prosper .
Scarcely Belial in the assembled Pandemonium was plausibler to ear and
eye . An indispensable man : in the great Art of Varnish he may be said
to seek his fellow . Has there an explosion arisen , as many do arise , a
confusion , unsightliness , which no tongue can speak of , nor eye look on ;
give it to Barrere ; Barrere shall be Committee @-@ Reporter of it ; you shall
see it transmute itself into a regularity , into the very beauty and
improvement that was needed . Without one such man , we say , how were
this Convention bested ? Call him not , as exaggerative Mercier does , &apos; the
greatest liar in France : &apos; nay it may be argued there is not truth enough
in him to make a real lie of . Call him , with Burke , Anacreon of the
Guillotine , and a man serviceable to this Convention .

The other Peace @-@ maker whom we name is Danton . Peace , O peace with one
another ! cries Danton often enough : Are we not alone against the world ;
a little band of brothers ? Broad Danton is loved by all the Mountain ;
but they think him too easy @-@ tempered , deficient in suspicion : he has
stood between Dumouriez and much censure , anxious not to exasperate our
only General : in the shrill tumult Danton &apos;s strong voice reverberates ,
for union and pacification . Meetings there are ; dinings with the
Girondins : it is so pressingly essential that there be union . But the
Girondins are haughty and respectable ; this Titan Danton is not a man of
Formulas , and there rests on him a shadow of September . &quot; Your Girondins
have no confidence in me : &quot; this is the answer a conciliatory Meillan
gets from him ; to all the arguments and pleadings this conciliatory
Meillan can bring , the repeated answer is , &quot; Ils n &apos;ont point de
confiance . &quot; ( Memoires de Meillan , Representant du Peuple ( Paris , 1823 ) ,
p . 51 . ) -- The tumult will get ever shriller ; rage is growing pale .

In fact , what a pang is it to the heart of a Girondin , this first
withering probability that the despicable unphilosophic anarchic
Mountain , after all , may triumph ! Brutal Septemberers , a fifth @-@ floor
Tallien , &apos; a Robespierre without an idea in his head , &apos; as Condorcet says ,
&apos;or a feeling in his heart : &apos; and yet we , the flower of France , cannot
stand against them ; behold the sceptre departs from us ; from us and goes
to them ! Eloquence , Philosophism , Respectability avail not : &apos; against
Stupidity the very gods fight to no purpose ,

&apos;Mit der Dummheit kampfen Gotter selbst vergebens ! &apos;

Shrill are the plaints of Louvet ; his thin existence all acidified into
rage , and preternatural insight of suspicion . Wroth is young Barbaroux ;
wroth and scornful . Silent , like a Queen with the aspic on her bosom ,
sits the wife of Roland ; Roland &apos;s Accounts never yet got audited ,
his name become a byword . Such is the fortune of war , especially of
revolution . The great gulf of Tophet , and Tenth of August , opened itself
at the magic of your eloquent voice ; and lo now , it will not close at
your voice ! It is a dangerous thing such magic . The Magician &apos;s Famulus
got hold of the forbidden Book , and summoned a goblin : Plait @-@ il , What is
your will ? said the Goblin . The Famulus , somewhat struck , bade him fetch
water : the swift goblin fetched it , pail in each hand ; but lo , would not
cease fetching it ! Desperate , the Famulus shrieks at him , smites at him ,
cuts him in two ; lo , two goblin water @-@ carriers ply ; and the house will
be swum away in Deucalion Deluges .



Chapter 3.3.IV.

Fatherland in Danger .

Or rather we will say , this Senatorial war might have lasted long ;
and Party tugging and throttling with Party might have suppressed and
smothered one another , in the ordinary bloodless Parliamentary way ;
on one condition : that France had been at least able to exist , all the
while . But this Sovereign People has a digestive faculty , and cannot do
without bread . Also we are at war , and must have victory ; at war with
Europe , with Fate and Famine : and behold , in the spring of the year , all
victory deserts us .

Dumouriez had his outposts stretched as far as Aix @-@ la @-@ Chapelle , and the
beautifullest plan for pouncing on Holland , by stratagem , flat @-@ bottomed
boats and rapid intrepidity ; wherein too he had prospered so far ; but
unhappily could prosper no further . Aix @-@ la @-@ Chapelle is lost ; Maestricht
will not surrender to mere smoke and noise : the flat @-@ bottomed boats must
launch themselves again , and return the way they came . Steady now , ye
rapidly intrepid men ; retreat with firmness , Parthian @-@ like ! Alas , were
it General Miranda &apos;s fault ; were it the War @-@ minister &apos;s fault ; or were it
Dumouriez &apos;s own fault and that of Fortune : enough , there is nothing
for it but retreat , -- well if it be not even flight ; for already
terror @-@ stricken cohorts and stragglers pour off , not waiting for order ;
flow disastrous , as many as ten thousand of them , without halt till they
see France again . ( Dumouriez , iv . 16 @-@ 73 . ) Nay worse : Dumouriez himself
is perhaps secretly turning traitor ? Very sharp is the tone in which he
writes to our Committees . Commissioners and Jacobin Pillagers have done
such incalculable mischief ; Hassenfratz sends neither cartridges nor
clothing ; shoes we have , deceptively &apos; soled with wood and pasteboard . &apos; 
Nothing in short is right . Danton and Lacroix , when it was they that
were Commissioners , would needs join Belgium to France ; -- of which
Dumouriez might have made the prettiest little Duchy for his own secret
behoof ! With all these things the General is wroth ; and writes to us
in a sharp tone . Who knows what this hot little General is meditating ?
Dumouriez Duke of Belgium or Brabant ; and say , Egalite the Younger King
of France : there were an end for our Revolution ! -- Committee of Defence
gazes , and shakes its head : who except Danton , defective in suspicion ,
could still struggle to be of hope ?

And General Custine is rolling back from the Rhine Country ; conquered
Mentz will be reconquered , the Prussians gathering round to bombard
it with shot and shell . Mentz may resist , Commissioner Merlin , the
Thionviller , &apos; making sallies , at the head of the besieged ; &apos; -- resist to
the death ; but not longer than that . How sad a reverse for Mentz ! Brave
Foster , brave Lux planted Liberty @-@ trees , amid ca @-@ ira @-@ ing music , in the
snow @-@ slush of last winter , there : and made Jacobin Societies ; and got
the Territory incorporated with France : they came hither to Paris , as
Deputies or Delegates , and have their eighteen francs a @-@ day : but see ,
before once the Liberty @-@ Tree is got rightly in leaf , Mentz is changing
into an explosive crater ; vomiting fire , bevomited with fire !

Neither of these men shall again see Mentz ; they have come hither only
to die . Foster has been round the Globe ; he saw Cook perish under Owyhee
clubs ; but like this Paris he has yet seen or suffered nothing . Poverty
escorts him : from home there can nothing come , except Job &apos;s @-@ news ;
the eighteen daily francs , which we here as Deputy or Delegate with
difficulty &apos; touch , &apos; are in paper assignats , and sink fast in value .
Poverty , disappointment , inaction , obloquy ; the brave heart slowly
breaking ! Such is Foster &apos;s lot . For the rest , Demoiselle Theroigne
smiles on you in the Soirees ; &apos; a beautiful brownlocked face , &apos; of an
exalted temper ; and contrives to keep her carriage . Prussian Trenck , the
poor subterranean Baron , jargons and jangles in an unmelodious manner .
Thomas Paine &apos;s face is red @-@ pustuled , &apos; but the eyes uncommonly bright . &apos; 
Convention Deputies ask you to dinner : very courteous ; and &apos; we all play
at plumsack . &apos; ( Forster &apos;s Briefwechsel , ii . 514 , 460 , 631 . ) &apos; It is the
Explosion and New @-@ creation of a World , &apos; says Foster ; &apos; and the actors
in it , such small mean objects , buzzing round one like a handful of
flies . &apos; --

Likewise there is war with Spain . Spain will advance through the gorges
of the Pyrenees ; rustling with Bourbon banners ; jingling with artillery
and menace . And England has donned the red coat ; and marches , with Royal
Highness of York , -- whom some once spake of inviting to be our King .
Changed that humour now : and ever more changing ; till no hatefuller
thing walk this Earth than a denizen of that tyrannous Island ; and Pitt
be declared and decreed , with effervescence , &apos; L &apos;ennemi du genre humain ,
The enemy of mankind ; &apos; and , very singular to say , you make an order
that no Soldier of Liberty give quarter to an Englishman . Which order
however , the Soldier of Liberty does but partially obey . We will take
no Prisoners then , say the Soldiers of Liberty ; they shall all be
&apos;Deserters &apos; that we take . ( See Dampmartin , Evenemens , ii . 213 @-@ 30 . ) It
is a frantic order ; and attended with inconvenience . For surely , if you
give no quarter , the plain issue is that you will get none ; and so the
business become as broad as it was long . -- Our &apos; recruitment of Three
Hundred Thousand men , &apos; which was the decreed force for this year , is
like to have work enough laid to its hand .

So many enemies come wending on ; penetrating through throats of
Mountains , steering over the salt sea ; towards all points of our
territory ; rattling chains at us . Nay worst of all : there is an enemy
within our own territory itself . In the early days of March , the Nantes
Postbags do not arrive ; there arrive only instead of them Conjecture ,
Apprehension , bodeful wind of Rumour . The bodefullest proves true ! Those
fanatic Peoples of La Vendee will no longer keep under : their fire of
insurrection , heretofore dissipated with difficulty , blazes out anew ,
after the King &apos;s Death , as a wide conflagration ; not riot , but civil
war . Your Cathelineaus , your Stofflets , Charettes , are other men than
was thought : behold how their Peasants , in mere russet and hodden ,
with their rude arms , rude array , with their fanatic Gaelic frenzy and
wild @-@ yelling battle @-@ cry of God and the King , dash at us like a dark
whirlwind ; and blow the best @-@ disciplined Nationals we can get into panic
and sauve @-@ qui @-@ peut ! Field after field is theirs ; one sees not where it
will end . Commandant Santerre may be sent thither ; but with non @-@ effect ;
he might as well have returned and brewed beer .

It has become peremptorily necessary that a National Convention cease
arguing , and begin acting . Yield one party of you to the other , and do
it swiftly . No theoretic outlook is here , but the close certainty of
ruin ; the very day that is passing over must be provided for .

It was Friday the eighth of March when this Job &apos;s @-@ post from Dumouriez ,
thickly preceded and escorted by so many other Job &apos;s @-@ posts , reached the
National Convention . Blank enough are most faces . Little will it avail
whether our Septemberers be punished or go unpunished ; if Pitt and
Cobourg are coming in , with one punishment for us all ; nothing now
between Paris itself and the Tyrants but a doubtful Dumouriez , and hosts
in loose @-@ flowing loud retreat ! -- Danton the Titan rises in this hour , as
always in the hour of need . Great is his voice , reverberating from the
domes : -- Citizen @-@ Representatives , shall we not , in such crisis of Fate ,
lay aside discords ? Reputation : O what is the reputation of this man or
of that ? Que mon nom soit fletri , que la France soit libre , Let my name
be blighted ; let France be free ! It is necessary now again that France
rise , in swift vengeance , with her million right @-@ hands , with her heart
as of one man . Instantaneous recruitment in Paris ; let every Section
of Paris furnish its thousands ; every section of France ! Ninety @-@ six
Commissioners of us , two for each Section of the Forty @-@ eight , they must
go forthwith , and tell Paris what the Country needs of her . Let Eighty
more of us be sent , post @-@ haste , over France ; to spread the fire @-@ cross ,
to call forth the might of men . Let the Eighty also be on the road ,
before this sitting rise . Let them go , and think what their errand is .
Speedy Camp of Fifty thousand between Paris and the North Frontier ; for
Paris will pour forth her volunteers ! Shoulder to shoulder ; one strong
universal death @-@ defiant rising and rushing ; we shall hurl back these
Sons of Night yet again ; and France , in spite of the world , be free !
( Moniteur in Hist . Parl. xxv . 6 . ) -- So sounds the Titan &apos;s voice : into
all Section @-@ houses ; into all French hearts . Sections sit in Permanence ,
for recruitment , enrolment , that very night . Convention Commissioners ,
on swift wheels , are carrying the fire @-@ cross from Town to Town , till all
France blaze .

And so there is Flag of Fatherland in Danger waving from the Townhall ,
Black Flag from the top of Notre @-@ Dame Cathedral ; there is Proclamation ,
hot eloquence ; Paris rushing out once again to strike its enemies
down . That , in such circumstances , Paris was in no mild humour can be
conjectured . Agitated streets ; still more agitated round the Salle de
Manege ! Feuillans @-@ Terrace crowds itself with angry Citizens , angrier
Citizenesses ; Varlet perambulates with portable @-@ chair : ejaculations of
no measured kind , as to perfidious fine @-@ spoken Hommes d &apos;etat , friends of
Dumouriez , secret @-@ friends of Pitt and Cobourg , burst from the hearts
and lips of men . To fight the enemy ? Yes , and even to &quot; freeze him with
terror , glacer d &apos;effroi ; &quot; but first to have domestic Traitors punished !
Who are they that , carping and quarrelling , in their jesuitic most
moderate way , seek to shackle the Patriotic movement ? That divide France
against Paris , and poison public opinion in the Departments ? That when
we ask for bread , and a Maximum fixed @-@ price , treat us with lectures on
Free @-@ trade in grains ? Can the human stomach satisfy itself with lectures
on Free @-@ trade ; and are we to fight the Austrians in a moderate manner ,
or in an immoderate ? This Convention must be purged .

&quot; Set up a swift Tribunal for Traitors , a Maximum for Grains : &quot; thus
speak with energy the Patriot Volunteers , as they defile through the
Convention Hall , just on the wing to the Frontiers ; -- perorating in
that heroical Cambyses &apos; vein of theirs : beshouted by the Galleries and
Mountain ; bemurmured by the Right @-@ side and Plain . Nor are prodigies
wanting : lo , while a Captain of the Section Poissonniere perorates with
vehemence about Dumouriez , Maximum , and Crypto @-@ Royalist Traitors , and
his troop beat chorus with him , waving their Banner overhead , the eye of
a Deputy discerns , in this same Banner , that the cravates or streamers
of it have Royal fleurs @-@ de @-@ lys ! The Section @-@ Captain shrieks ; his troop
shriek , horror @-@ struck , and &apos; trample the Banner under foot : &apos; seemingly
the work of some Crypto @-@ Royalist Plotter ? Most probable ; ( Choix des
Rapports , xi . 277 . ) -- or perhaps at bottom , only the old Banner of the
Section , manufactured prior to the Tenth of August , when such streamers
were according to rule ! ( Hist . Parl. xxv . 72 . )

History , looking over the Girondin Memoirs , anxious to disentangle the
truth of them from the hysterics , finds these days of March , especially
this Sunday the Tenth of March , play a great part . Plots , plots : a plot
for murdering the Girondin Deputies ; Anarchists and Secret @-@ Royalists
plotting , in hellish concert , for that end ! The far greater part of
which is hysterics . What we do find indisputable is that Louvet and
certain Girondins were apprehensive they might be murdered on Saturday ,
and did not go to the evening sitting : but held council with one
another , each inciting his fellow to do something resolute , and end
these Anarchists : to which , however , Petion , opening the window , and
finding the night very wet , answered only , &quot; Ils ne feront rien , &quot; and
&apos;composedly resumed his violin , &apos; says Louvet : ( Louvet , Memoires , p . 72 . )
thereby , with soft Lydian tweedledeeing , to wrap himself against eating
cares . Also that Louvet felt especially liable to being killed ; that
several Girondins went abroad to seek beds : liable to being killed ;
but were not . Further that , in very truth , Journalist Deputy Gorsas ,
poisoner of the Departments , he and his Printer had their houses broken
into ( by a tumult of Patriots , among whom red @-@ capped Varlet , American
Fournier loom forth , in the darkness of the rain and riot ) ; had their
wives put in fear ; their presses , types and circumjacent equipments
beaten to ruin ; no Mayor interfering in time ; Gorsas himself escaping ,
pistol in hand , &apos; along the coping of the back wall . &apos; Further that
Sunday , the morrow , was not a workday ; and the streets were more
agitated than ever : Is it a new September , then , that these Anarchists
intend ? Finally , that no September came ; -- and also that hysterics ,
not unnaturally , had reached almost their acme . ( Meillan , pp. 23 , 24 ;
Louvet , pp. 71 @-@ 80 . )

Vergniaud denounces and deplores ; in sweetly turned periods . Section
Bonconseil , Good @-@ counsel so @-@ named , not Mauconseil or Ill @-@ counsel as it
once was , -- does a far notabler thing : demands that Vergniaud , Brissot ,
Guadet , and other denunciatory fine @-@ spoken Girondins , to the number of
Twenty @-@ two , be put under arrest ! Section Good @-@ counsel , so named ever
since the Tenth of August , is sharply rebuked , like a Section of
Ill @-@ counsel ; ( Moniteur ( Seance du 12 Mars ) , 15 Mars . ) but its word is
spoken , and will not fall to the ground .

In fact , one thing strikes us in these poor Girondins ; their fatal
shortness of vision ; nay fatal poorness of character , for that is the
root of it . They are as strangers to the People they would govern ;
to the thing they have come to work in . Formulas , Philosophies ,
Respectabilities , what has been written in Books , and admitted by the
Cultivated Classes ; this inadequate Scheme of Nature &apos;s working is all
that Nature , let her work as she will , can reveal to these men . So
they perorate and speculate ; and call on the Friends of Law , when the
question is not Law or No @-@ Law , but Life or No @-@ Life . Pedants of the
Revolution , if not Jesuits of it ! Their Formalism is great ; great also
is their Egoism . France rising to fight Austria has been raised only by
Plot of the Tenth of March , to kill Twenty @-@ two of them ! This Revolution
Prodigy , unfolding itself into terrific stature and articulation , by
its own laws and Nature &apos;s , not by the laws of Formula , has become
unintelligible , incredible as an impossibility , the waste chaos of a
Dream . &apos; A Republic founded on what they call the Virtues ; on what
we call the Decencies and Respectabilities : this they will have , and
nothing but this . Whatsoever other Republic Nature and Reality send ,
shall be considered as not sent ; as a kind of Nightmare Vision , and
thing non @-@ extant ; disowned by the Laws of Nature , and of Formula . Alas !
Dim for the best eyes is this Reality ; and as for these men , they will
not look at it with eyes at all , but only through &apos; facetted spectacles&apos;
of Pedantry , wounded Vanity ; which yield the most portentous fallacious
spectrum . Carping and complaining forever of Plots and Anarchy , they
will do one thing : prove , to demonstration , that the Reality will
not translate into their Formula ; that they and their Formula are
incompatible with the Reality : and , in its dark wrath , the Reality will
extinguish it and them ! What a man kens he cans . But the beginning of
a man &apos;s doom is that vision be withdrawn from him ; that he see not the
reality , but a false spectrum of the reality ; and , following that , step
darkly , with more or less velocity , downwards to the utter Dark ; to
Ruin , which is the great Sea of Darkness , whither all falsehoods ,
winding or direct , continually flow !

This Tenth of March we may mark as an epoch in the Girondin destinies ;
the rage so exasperated itself , the misconception so darkened itself .
Many desert the sittings ; many come to them armed . ( Meillan , Memoires ,
pp. 85 , 24 . ) An honourable Deputy , setting out after breakfast , must
now , besides taking his Notes , see whether his Priming is in order .

Meanwhile with Dumouriez in Belgium it fares ever worse . Were it again
General Miranda &apos;s fault , or some other &apos;s fault , there is no doubt
whatever but the &apos; Battle of Nerwinden , &apos; on the 18th of March , is
lost ; and our rapid retreat has become a far too rapid one . Victorious
Cobourg , with his Austrian prickers , hangs like a dark cloud on the
rear of us : Dumouriez never off horseback night or day ; engagement every
three hours ; our whole discomfited Host rolling rapidly inwards , full
of rage , suspicion , and sauve @-@ qui @-@ peut ! And then Dumouriez himself , what
his intents may be ? Wicked seemingly and not charitable ! His despatches
to Committee openly denounce a factious Convention , for the woes it
has brought on France and him . And his speeches -- for the General has no
reticence ! The Execution of the Tyrant this Dumouriez calls the Murder
of the King . Danton and Lacroix , flying thither as Commissioners once
more , return very doubtful ; even Danton now doubts .

Three Jacobin Missionaries , Proly , Dubuisson , Pereyra , have flown forth ;
sped by a wakeful Mother Society : they are struck dumb to hear the
General speak . The Convention , according to this General , consists of
three hundred scoundrels and four hundred imbeciles : France cannot do
without a King . &quot; But we have executed our King . &quot; &quot; And what is it to me , &quot;
hastily cries Dumouriez , a General of no reticence , &quot; whether the King &apos;s
name be Ludovicus or Jacobus ? &quot; &quot; Or Philippus ! &quot; rejoins Proly ; -- and
hastens to report progress . Over the Frontiers such hope is there .



Chapter 3.3.V.

Sansculottism Accoutred .

Let us look , however , at the grand internal Sansculottism and Revolution
Prodigy , whether it stirs and waxes : there and not elsewhere hope may
still be for France . The Revolution Prodigy , as Decree after Decree
issues from the Mountain , like creative fiats , accordant with the nature
of the Thing , -- is shaping itself rapidly , in these days , into terrific
stature and articulation , limb after limb . Last March , 1792 , we saw all
France flowing in blind terror ; shutting town @-@ barriers , boiling pitch
for Brigands : happier , this March , that it is a seeing terror ; that a
creative Mountain exists , which can say fiat ! Recruitment proceeds with
fierce celerity : nevertheless our Volunteers hesitate to set out , till
Treason be punished at home ; they do not fly to the frontiers ; but only
fly hither and thither , demanding and denouncing . The Mountain must
speak new fiat , and new fiats .

And does it not speak such ? Take , as first example , those Comites
Revolutionnaires for the arrestment of Persons Suspect . Revolutionary
Committee , of Twelve chosen Patriots , sits in every Township of France ;
examining the Suspect , seeking arms , making domiciliary visits and
arrestments ; -- caring , generally , that the Republic suffer no detriment .
Chosen by universal suffrage , each in its Section , they are a kind of
elixir of Jacobinism ; some Forty @-@ four Thousand of them awake and alive
over France ! In Paris and all Towns , every house @-@ door must have the
names of the inmates legibly printed on it , &apos; at a height not exceeding
five feet from the ground ; &apos; every Citizen must produce his certificatory
Carte de Civisme , signed by Section @-@ President ; every man be ready to
give account of the faith that is in him . Persons Suspect had as well
depart this soil of Liberty ! And yet departure too is bad : all Emigrants
are declared Traitors , their property become National ; they are &apos; dead in
Law , &apos; -- save indeed that for our behoof they shall &apos; live yet fifty
years in Law , &apos; and what heritages may fall to them in that time become
National too ! A mad vitality of Jacobinism , with Forty @-@ four Thousand
centres of activity , circulates through all fibres of France .

Very notable also is the Tribunal Extraordinaire : ( Moniteur , No. 70,
( du 11 Mars ) , No. 76 , &amp; c . ) decreed by the Mountain ; some Girondins
dissenting , for surely such a Court contradicts every formula ; -- other
Girondins assenting , nay co @-@ operating , for do not we all hate Traitors ,
O ye people of Paris ? -- Tribunal of the Seventeenth in Autumn last was
swift ; but this shall be swifter . Five Judges ; a standing Jury , which
is named from Paris and the Neighbourhood , that there be not delay in
naming it : they are subject to no Appeal ; to hardly any Law @-@ forms , but
must &apos; get themselves convinced &apos; in all readiest ways ; and for security
are bound &apos; to vote audibly ; &apos; audibly , in the hearing of a Paris Public .
This is the Tribunal Extraordinaire ; which , in few months , getting
into most lively action , shall be entitled Tribunal Revolutionnaire , as
indeed it from the very first has entitled itself : with a Herman or
a Dumas for Judge President , with a Fouquier @-@ Tinville for
Attorney @-@ General , and a Jury of such as Citizen Leroi , who has surnamed
himself Dix @-@ Aout , &apos; Leroi August @-@ Tenth , &apos; it will become the wonder of
the world . Herein has Sansculottism fashioned for itself a Sword of
Sharpness : a weapon magical ; tempered in the Stygian hell @-@ waters ; to the
edge of it all armour , and defence of strength or of cunning shall be
soft ; it shall mow down Lives and Brazen @-@ gates ; and the waving of it
shed terror through the souls of men .

But speaking of an amorphous Sansculottism taking form , ought we not
above all things to specify how the Amorphous gets itself a Head ?
Without metaphor , this Revolution Government continues hitherto in a
very anarchic state . Executive Council of Ministers , Six in number ,
there is ; but they , especially since Roland &apos;s retreat , have hardly known
whether they were Ministers or not . Convention Committees sit supreme
over them ; but then each Committee as supreme as the others : Committee
of Twenty @-@ one , of Defence , of General Surety ; simultaneous
or successive , for specific purposes . The Convention alone is
all @-@ powerful , -- especially if the Commune go with it ; but is too numerous
for an administrative body . Wherefore , in this perilous quick @-@ whirling
condition of the Republic , before the end of March , we obtain our small
Comite de Salut Public ; ( Moniteur , No. 83 ( du 24 Mars 1793 ) Nos. 86 , 98,
99 , 100 . ) as it were , for miscellaneous accidental purposes , requiring
despatch ; -- as it proves , for a sort of universal supervision ,
and universal subjection . They are to report weekly , these new
Committee @-@ men ; but to deliberate in secret . Their number is Nine , firm
Patriots all , Danton one of them : Renewable every month ; -- yet why not
reelect them if they turn out well ? The flower of the matter is that
they are but nine ; that they sit in secret . An insignificant @-@ looking
thing at first , this Committee ; but with a principle of growth in it !
Forwarded by fortune , by internal Jacobin energy , it will reduce
all Committees and the Convention itself to mute obedience , the Six
Ministers to Six assiduous Clerks ; and work its will on the Earth and
under Heaven , for a season . &apos; A Committee of Public Salvation , &apos; whereat
the world still shrieks and shudders .

If we call that Revolutionary Tribunal a Sword , which Sansculottism
has provided for itself , then let us call the &apos; Law of the Maximum , &apos; a
Provender @-@ scrip , or Haversack , wherein better or worse some ration of
bread may be found . It is true , Political Economy , Girondin free @-@ trade ,
and all law of supply and demand , are hereby hurled topsyturvy : but what
help ? Patriotism must live ; the &apos; cupidity of farmers &apos; seems to have no
bowels . Wherefore this Law of the Maximum , fixing the highest price of
grains , is , with infinite effort , got passed ; ( Moniteur , du 20 Avril ,
&amp; c. to 20 Mai , 1793 . ) and shall gradually extend itself into a Maximum
for all manner of comestibles and commodities : with such scrambling and
topsyturvying as may be fancied ! For now , if , for example , the farmer
will not sell ? The farmer shall be forced to sell . An accurate
Account of what grain he has shall be delivered in to the Constituted
Authorities : let him see that he say not too much ; for in that case ,
his rents , taxes and contributions will rise proportionally : let him
see that he say not too little ; for , on or before a set day , we shall
suppose in April , less than one @-@ third of this declared quantity , must
remain in his barns , more than two @-@ thirds of it must have been thrashed
and sold . One can denounce him , and raise penalties .

By such inextricable overturning of all Commercial relation will
Sansculottism keep life in ; since not otherwise . On the whole , as
Camille Desmoulins says once , &quot; while the Sansculottes fight , the
Monsieurs must pay . &quot; So there come Impots Progressifs , Ascending Taxes ;
which consume , with fast @-@ increasing voracity , and &apos; superfluous @-@ revenue&apos;
of men : beyond fifty @-@ pounds a @-@ year you are not exempt ; rising into the
hundreds you bleed freely ; into the thousands and tens of thousands , you
bleed gushing . Also there come Requisitions ; there comes &apos; Forced @-@ Loan
of a Milliard , &apos; some Fifty @-@ Millions Sterling ; which of course they that
have must lend . Unexampled enough : it has grown to be no country for the
Rich , this ; but a country for the Poor ! And then if one fly , what steads
it ? Dead in Law ; nay kept alive fifty years yet , for their
accursed behoof ! In this manner , therefore , it goes ; topsyturvying ,
ca @-@ ira @-@ ing ; -- and withal there is endless sale of Emigrant
National @-@ Property , there is Cambon with endless cornucopia of Assignats .
The Trade and Finance of Sansculottism ; and how , with Maximum and
Bakers &apos; -queues , with Cupidity , Hunger , Denunciation and Paper @-@ money ,
it led its galvanic @-@ life , and began and ended , -- remains the most
interesting of all Chapters in Political Economy : still to be written .

All which things are they not clean against Formula ? O Girondin Friends ,
it is not a Republic of the Virtues we are getting ; but only a Republic
of the Strengths , virtuous and other !



Chapter 3.3.VI.

The Traitor .

But Dumouriez , with his fugitive Host , with his King Ludovicus or King
Philippus ? There lies the crisis ; there hangs the question : Revolution
Prodigy , or Counter @-@ Revolution ? -- One wide shriek covers that North @-@ East
region . Soldiers , full of rage , suspicion and terror , flock hither and
thither ; Dumouriez the many @-@ counselled , never off horseback , knows
now no counsel that were not worse than none : the counsel , namely ,
of joining himself with Cobourg ; marching to Paris , extinguishing
Jacobinism , and , with some new King Ludovicus or King Philippus , resting
the Constitution of 1791 ! ( Dumouriez , Memoires , iv. c . 7 @-@ 10 . )

Is Wisdom quitting Dumouriez ; the herald of Fortune quitting him ?
Principle , faith political or other , beyond a certain faith of
mess @-@ rooms , and honour of an officer , had him not to quit . At any
rate , his quarters in the Burgh of Saint @-@ Amand ; his headquarters in
the Village of Saint @-@ Amand des Boues , a short way off , -- have become a
Bedlam . National Representatives , Jacobin Missionaries are riding and
running : of the &apos; three Towns , &apos; Lille , Valenciennes or even Conde , which
Dumouriez wanted to snatch for himself , not one can be snatched : your
Captain is admitted , but the Town @-@ gate is closed on him , and then the
Prison gate , and &apos; his men wander about the ramparts . &apos; Couriers
gallop breathless ; men wait , or seem waiting , to assassinate , to
be assassinated ; Battalions nigh frantic with such suspicion and
uncertainty , with Vive @-@ la @-@ Republique and Sauve @-@ qui @-@ peut , rush this way
and that ; -- Ruin and Desperation in the shape of Cobourg lying entrenched
close by .

Dame Genlis and her fair Princess d &apos;Orleans find this Burgh of
Saint @-@ Amand no fit place for them ; Dumouriez &apos;s protection is grown worse
than none . Tough Genlis one of the toughest women ; a woman , as it were ,
with nine lives in her ; whom nothing will beat : she packs her bandboxes ;
clear for flight in a private manner . Her beloved Princess she
will -- leave here , with the Prince Chartres Egalite her Brother . In the
cold grey of the April morning , we find her accordingly established
in her hired vehicle , on the street of Saint @-@ Amand ; postilions just
cracking their whips to go , -- when behold the young Princely Brother ,
struggling hitherward , hastily calling ; bearing the Princess in his
arms ! Hastily he has clutched the poor young lady up , in her very
night @-@ gown , nothing saved of her goods except the watch from the pillow :
with brotherly despair he flings her in , among the bandboxes , into
Genlis &apos;s chaise , into Genlis &apos;s arms : Leave her not , in the name of Mercy
and Heaven ! A shrill scene , but a brief one : -- the postilions crack and
go . Ah , whither ? Through by @-@ roads and broken hill @-@ passes : seeking
their way with lanterns after nightfall ; through perils , and Cobourg
Austrians , and suspicious French Nationals ; finally , into Switzerland ;
safe though nigh moneyless . ( Genlis , iv . 139 . ) The brave young Egalite
has a most wild Morrow to look for ; but now only himself to carry
through it .

For indeed over at that Village named of the Mudbaths , Saint @-@ Amand des
Boues , matters are still worse . About four o &apos;clock on Tuesday afternoon ,
the 2d of April 1793 , two Couriers come galloping as if for life : Mon
General ! Four National Representatives , War @-@ Minister at their head , are
posting hitherward , from Valenciennes : are close at hand , -- with what
intents one may guess ! While the Couriers are yet speaking , War @-@ Minister
and National Representatives , old Camus the Archivist for chief speaker
of them , arrive . Hardly has Mon General had time to order out the Huzzar
Regiment de Berchigny ; that it take rank and wait near by , in case of
accident . And so , enter War @-@ Minister Beurnonville , with an embrace of
friendship , for he is an old friend ; enter Archivist Camus and the other
three , following him .

They produce Papers , invite the General to the bar of the Convention :
merely to give an explanation or two . The General finds it unsuitable ,
not to say impossible , and that &quot; the service will suffer . &quot; Then comes
reasoning ; the voice of the old Archivist getting loud . Vain to reason
loud with this Dumouriez ; he answers mere angry irreverences . And
so , amid plumed staff @-@ officers , very gloomy @-@ looking ; in jeopardy and
uncertainty , these poor National messengers debate and consult , retire
and re @-@ enter , for the space of some two hours : without effect . Whereupon
Archivist Camus , getting quite loud , proclaims , in the name of the
National Convention , for he has the power to do it , That General
Dumouriez is arrested : &quot; Will you obey the National Mandate , General ! &quot;
&quot; Pas dans ce moment @-@ ci , Not at this particular moment , &quot; answers the
General also aloud ; then glancing the other way , utters certain unknown
vocables , in a mandatory manner ; seemingly a German word @-@ of @-@ command .
( Dumouriez , iv . 159 , &amp; c . ) Hussars clutch the Four National
Representatives , and Beurnonville the War @-@ minister ; pack them out of the
apartment ; out of the Village , over the lines to Cobourg , in two chaises
that very night , -- as hostages , prisoners ; to lie long in Maestricht and
Austrian strongholds ! ( Their Narrative , written by Camus in Toulongeon ,
iii. app . 60 @-@ 87 . ) Jacta est alea .

This night Dumouriez prints his &apos; Proclamation ; &apos; this night and the
morrow the Dumouriez Army , in such darkness visible , and rage of
semi @-@ desperation as there is , shall meditate what the General is doing ,
what they themselves will do in it . Judge whether this Wednesday was of
halcyon nature , for any one ! But , on the Thursday morning , we
discern Dumouriez with small escort , with Chartres Egalite and a few
staff @-@ officers , ambling along the Conde Highway : perhaps they are for
Conde , and trying to persuade the Garrison there ; at all events ,
they are for an interview with Cobourg , who waits in the woods by
appointment , in that quarter . Nigh the Village of Doumet , three National
Battalions , a set of men always full of Jacobinism , sweep past us ;
marching rather swiftly , -- seemingly in mistake , by a way we had not
ordered . The General dismounts , steps into a cottage , a little from
the wayside ; will give them right order in writing . Hark ! what strange
growling is heard : what barkings are heard , loud yells of &quot; Traitors , &quot; of
&quot; Arrest : &quot; the National Battalions have wheeled round , are emitting shot !
Mount , Dumouriez , and spring for life ! Dumouriez and Staff strike the
spurs in , deep ; vault over ditches , into the fields , which prove to be
morasses ; sprawl and plunge for life ; bewhistled with curses and lead .
Sunk to the middle , with or without horses , several servants killed ,
they escape out of shot @-@ range , to General Mack the Austrian &apos;s quarters .
Nay they return on the morrow , to Saint @-@ Amand and faithful foreign
Berchigny ; but what boots it ? The Artillery has all revolted , is
jingling off to Valenciennes : all have revolted , are revolting ; except
only foreign Berchigny , to the extent of some poor fifteen hundred ,
none will follow Dumouriez against France and Indivisible Republic :
Dumouriez &apos;s occupation &apos;s gone . ( Memoires , iv . 162 @-@ 180 . )

Such an instinct of Frenehhood and Sansculottism dwells in these men :
they will follow no Dumouriez nor Lafayette , nor any mortal on
such errand . Shriek may be of Sauve @-@ qui @-@ peut , but will also be of
Vive @-@ la @-@ Republique . New National Representatives arrive ; new General
Dampierre , soon killed in battle ; new General Custine ; the agitated
Hosts draw back to some Camp of Famars ; make head against Cobourg as
they can .

And so Dumouriez is in the Austrian quarters ; his drama ended , in this
rather sorry manner . A most shifty , wiry man ; one of Heaven &apos;s Swiss that
wanted only work . Fifty years of unnoticed toil and valour ; one year of
toil and valour , not unnoticed , but seen of all countries and centuries ;
then thirty other years again unnoticed , of Memoir @-@ writing , English
Pension , scheming and projecting to no purpose : Adieu thou Swiss of
Heaven , worthy to have been something else !

His Staff go different ways . Brave young Egalite reaches Switzerland and
the Genlis Cottage ; with a strong crabstick in his hand , a strong heart
in his body : his Princedom in now reduced to that . Egalite the Father
sat playing whist , in his Palais Egalite , at Paris , on the 6th day of
this same month of April , when a catchpole entered : Citoyen Egalite
is wanted at the Convention Committee ! ( See Montgaillard , iv . 144 . )
Examination , requiring Arrestment ; finally requiring Imprisonment ,
transference to Marseilles and the Castle of If ! Orleansdom has sunk
in the black waters ; Palais Egalite , which was Palais Royal , is like to
become Palais National .



Chapter 3.3.VII.

In Fight .

Our Republic , by paper Decree , may be &apos; One and Indivisible ; &apos; but what
profits it while these things are ? Federalists in the Senate , renegadoes
in the Army , traitors everywhere ! France , all in desperate recruitment
since the Tenth of March , does not fly to the frontier , but only flies
hither and thither . This defection of contemptuous diplomatic Dumouriez
falls heavy on the fine @-@ spoken high @-@ sniffing Hommes d &apos;etat , whom he
consorted with ; forms a second epoch in their destinies .

Or perhaps more strictly we might say , the second Girondin epoch ,
though little noticed then , began on the day when , in reference to this
defection , the Girondins broke with Danton . It was the first day of
April ; Dumouriez had not yet plunged across the morasses to Cobourg , but
was evidently meaning to do it , and our Commissioners were off to arrest
him ; when what does the Girondin Lasource see good to do , but rise ,
and jesuitically question and insinuate at great length , whether a main
accomplice of Dumouriez had not probably been -- Danton ? Gironde grins
sardonic assent ; Mountain holds its breath . The figure of Danton ,
Levasseur says , while this speech went on , was noteworthy . He sat erect ,
with a kind of internal convulsion struggling to keep itself motionless ;
his eye from time to time flashing wilder , his lip curling in Titanic
scorn . ( Memoires de Rene Levasseur ( Bruxelles , 1830 ) , i . 164 . ) Lasource ,
in a fine @-@ spoken attorney @-@ manner , proceeds : there is this probability to
his mind , and there is that ; probabilities which press painfully on him ,
which cast the Patriotism of Danton under a painful shade ; which painful
shade he , Lasource , will hope that Danton may find it not impossible to
dispel .

&quot; Les Scelerats ! &quot; cries Danton , starting up , with clenched right @-@ hand ,
Lasource having done : and descends from the Mountain , like a lava @-@ flood ;
his answer not unready . Lasource &apos;s probabilities fly like idle dust ; but
leave a result behind them . &quot; Ye were right , friends of the Mountain , &quot;
begins Danton , &quot; and I was wrong : there is no peace possible with these
men . Let it be war then ! They will not save the Republic with us : it
shall be saved without them ; saved in spite of them . &quot; Really a burst of
rude Parliamentary eloquence this ; which is still worth reading , in
the old Moniteur ! With fire @-@ words the exasperated rude Titan rives and
smites these Girondins ; at every hit the glad Mountain utters chorus :
Marat , like a musical bis , repeating the last phrase . ( Seance du 1er
Avril , 1793 in Hist . Parl. xxv . 24 @-@ 35 . ) Lasource &apos;s probabilities are
gone : but Danton &apos;s pledge of battle remains lying .

A third epoch , or scene in the Girondin Drama , or rather it is but
the completion of this second epoch , we reckon from the day when the
patience of virtuous Petion finally boiled over ; and the Girondins ,
so to speak , took up this battle @-@ pledge of Danton &apos;s and decreed Marat
accused . It was the eleventh of the same month of April , on some
effervescence rising , such as often rose ; and President had covered
himself , mere Bedlam now ruling ; and Mountain and Gironde were rushing
on one another with clenched right @-@ hands , and even with pistols in them ;
when , behold , the Girondin Duperret drew a sword ! Shriek of horror
rose , instantly quenching all other effervescence , at sight of the
clear murderous steel ; whereupon Duperret returned it to the leather
again ; -- confessing that he did indeed draw it , being instigated by a
kind of sacred madness , &quot; sainte fureur , &quot; and pistols held at him ; but
that if he parricidally had chanced to scratch the outmost skin of
National Representation with it , he too carried pistols , and would have
blown his brains out on the spot . ( Hist . Parl. xv . 397 . )

But now in such posture of affairs , virtuous Petion rose , next morning ,
to lament these effervescences , this endless Anarchy invading the
Legislative Sanctuary itself ; and here , being growled at and howled at
by the Mountain , his patience , long tried , did , as we say , boil over ;
and he spake vehemently , in high key , with foam on his lips ; &apos; whence , &apos;
says Marat , &apos; I concluded he had got &apos; la rage , &apos; the rabidity , or
dog @-@ madness . Rabidity smites others rabid : so there rises new
foam @-@ lipped demand to have Anarchists extinguished ; and specially
to have Marat put under Accusation . Send a Representative to the
Revolutionary Tribunal ? Violate the inviolability of a Representative ?
Have a care , O Friends ! This poor Marat has faults enough ; but against
Liberty or Equality , what fault ? That he has loved and fought for it ,
not wisely but too well . In dungeons and cellars , in pinching poverty ,
under anathema of men ; even so , in such fight , has he grown so dingy ,
bleared ; even so has his head become a Stylites one ! Him you will
fling to your Sword of Sharpness ; while Cobourg and Pitt advance on us ,
fire @-@ spitting ?

The Mountain is loud , the Gironde is loud and deaf ; all lips are foamy .
With &apos; Permanent @-@ Session of twenty @-@ four hours , &apos; with vote by rollcall ,
and a dead @-@ lift effort , the Gironde carries it : Marat is ordered to
the Revolutionary Tribunal , to answer for that February Paragraph of
Forestallers at the door @-@ lintel , with other offences ; and , after a
little hesitation , he obeys . ( Moniteur , du 16 Avril 1793 , et seqq . )

Thus is Danton &apos;s battle @-@ pledge taken up : there is , as he said there
would be , &apos; war without truce or treaty , ni treve ni composition . &apos; 
Wherefore , close now with one another , Formula and Reality , in
death @-@ grips , and wrestle it out ; both of you cannot live , but only one !



Chapter 3.3.VIII.

In Death @-@ Grips .

It proves what strength , were it only of inertia , there is in
established Formulas , what weakness in nascent Realities , and
illustrates several things , that this death @-@ wrestle should still have
lasted some six weeks or more . National business , discussion of the
Constitutional Act , for our Constitution should decidedly be got ready ,
proceeds along with it . We even change our Locality ; we shift , on the
Tenth of May , from the old Salle de Manege , into our new Hall , in the
Palace , once a King &apos;s but now the Republic &apos;s , of the Tuileries . Hope and
ruth , flickering against despair and rage , still struggles in the minds
of men .

It is a most dark confused death @-@ wrestle , this of the six weeks .
Formalist frenzy against Realist frenzy ; Patriotism , Egoism , Pride ,
Anger , Vanity , Hope and Despair , all raised to the frenetic pitch :
Frenzy meets Frenzy , like dark clashing whirlwinds ; neither understands
the other ; the weaker , one day , will understand that it is verily swept
down ! Girondism is strong as established Formula and Respectability : do
not as many as Seventy @-@ two of the Departments , or say respectable Heads
of Departments , declare for us ? Calvados , which loves its Buzot , will
even rise in revolt , so hint the Addresses ; Marseilles , cradle of
Patriotism , will rise ; Bourdeaux will rise , and the Gironde Department ,
as one man ; in a word , who will not rise , were our Representation
Nationale to be insulted , or one hair of a Deputy &apos;s head harmed ! The
Mountain , again , is strong as Reality and Audacity . To the Reality of
the Mountain are not all furthersome things possible ? A new Tenth of
August , if needful ; nay a new Second of September ! --

But , on Wednesday afternoon , twenty @-@ fourth day of April , year 1793,
what tumult as of fierce jubilee is this ? It is Marat returning from
Revolutionary Tribunal ! A week or more of death @-@ peril : and now there
is triumphant acquittal ; Revolutionary Tribunal can find no accusation
against this man . And so the eye of History beholds Patriotism , which
had gloomed unutterable things all week , break into loud jubilee ,
embrace its Marat ; lift him into a chair of triumph , bear him
shoulder @-@ high through the streets . Shoulder @-@ high is the injured
People &apos;s @-@ friend , crowned with an oak @-@ garland ; amid the wavy sea of red
nightcaps , carmagnole jackets , grenadier bonnets and female mob @-@ caps ;
far @-@ sounding like a sea ! The injured People &apos;s @-@ friend has here reached
his culminating @-@ point ; he too strikes the stars with his sublime head .

But the Reader can judge with what face President Lasource , he of the
&apos;painful probabilities , &apos; who presides in this Convention Hall , might
welcome such jubilee @-@ tide , when it got thither , and the Decreed of
Accusation floating on the top of it ! A National Sapper , spokesman on
the occasion , says , the People know their Friend , and love his life as
their own ; &quot; whosoever wants Marat &apos;s head must get the Sapper &apos;s first . &quot;
( Seance in Moniteur , No. 116 , du 26 Avril , An 1er . ) Lasource answered
with some vague painful mumblement , -- which , says Levasseur , one could
not help tittering at . ( Levasseur , Memoires , i. c . 6 . ) Patriot Sections ,
Volunteers not yet gone to the Frontiers , come demanding the &quot; purgation
of traitors from your own bosom ; &quot; the expulsion , or even the trial and
sentence , of a factious Twenty @-@ two .

Nevertheless the Gironde has got its Commission of Twelve ; a Commission
specially appointed for investigating these troubles of the Legislative
Sanctuary : let Sansculottism say what it will , Law shall triumph .
Old @-@ Constituent Rabaut Saint @-@ Etienne presides over this Commission :
&quot; it is the last plank whereon a wrecked Republic may perhaps still save
herself . &quot; Rabaut and they therefore sit , intent ; examining
witnesses ; launching arrestments ; looking out into a waste dim sea of
troubles . -- the womb of Formula , or perhaps her grave ! Enter not that
sea , O Reader ! There are dim desolation and confusion ; raging women and
raging men . Sections come demanding Twenty @-@ two ; for the number first
given by Section Bonconseil still holds , though the names should even
vary . Other Sections , of the wealthier kind , come denouncing such
demand ; nay the same Section will demand to @-@ day , and denounce the demand
to @-@ morrow , according as the wealthier sit , or the poorer . Wherefore ,
indeed , the Girondins decree that all Sections shall close &apos; at ten
in the evening ; &apos; before the working people come : which Decree remains
without effect . And nightly the Mother of Patriotism wails doleful ;
doleful , but her eye kindling ! And Fournier l &apos;Americain is busy , and
the two Banker Freys , and Varlet Apostle of Liberty ; the bull @-@ voice
of Marquis Saint @-@ Huruge is heard . And shrill women vociferate from all
Galleries , the Convention ones and downwards . Nay a &apos; Central Committee&apos;
of all the Forty @-@ eight Sections , looms forth huge and dubious ; sitting
dim in the Archeveche , sending Resolutions , receiving them : a Centre of
the Sections ; in dread deliberation as to a New Tenth of August !

One thing we will specify to throw light on many : the aspect under
which , seen through the eyes of these Girondin Twelve , or even seen
through one &apos;s own eyes , the Patriotism of the softer sex presents
itself . There are Female Patriots , whom the Girondins call Megaeras ,
and count to the extent of eight thousand ; with serpent @-@ hair , all out
of curl ; who have changed the distaff for the dagger . They are of &apos; the
Society called Brotherly , &apos; Fraternelle , say Sisterly , which meets under
the roof of the Jacobins . &apos; Two thousand daggers , &apos; or so , have been
ordered , -- doubtless , for them . They rush to Versailles , to raise more
women ; but the Versailles women will not rise . ( Buzot , Memoires , pp. 69,
84 ; Meillan , Memoires , pp. 192 , 195 , 196 . See Commission des Douze in
Choix des Rapports , xii . 69 @-@ 131 . )

Nay , behold , in National Garden of Tuileries , -- Demoiselle Theroigne
herself is become as a brownlocked Diana ( were that possible ) attacked
by her own dogs , or she @-@ dogs ! The Demoiselle , keeping her carriage , is
for Liberty indeed , as she has full well shewn ; but then for Liberty
with Respectability : whereupon these serpent @-@ haired Extreme She @-@ Patriots
now do fasten on her , tatter her , shamefully fustigate her , in their
shameful way ; almost fling her into the Garden @-@ ponds , had not help
intervened . Help , alas , to small purpose . The poor Demoiselle &apos;s head and
nervous @-@ system , none of the soundest , is so tattered and fluttered that
it will never recover ; but flutter worse and worse , till it crack ; and
within year and day we hear of her in madhouse , and straitwaistcoat ,
which proves permanent ! -- Such brownlocked Figure did flutter , and
inarticulately jabber and gesticulate , little able to speak the obscure
meaning it had , through some segment of that Eighteenth Century of
Time . She disappears here from the Revolution and Public History , for
evermore . ( Deux Amis , vii . 77 @-@ 80 ; Forster , i . 514 ; Moore , i . 70 . She
did not die till 1817 ; in the Salpetriere , in the most abject state of
insanity ; see Esquirol , Des Maladies Mentales ( Paris , 1838 ) , i . 445 @-@ 50 . )

Another thing we will not again specify , yet again beseech the Reader
to imagine : the reign of Fraternity and Perfection . Imagine , we say , O
Reader , that the Millennium were struggling on the threshold , and yet
not so much as groceries could be had , -- owing to traitors . With what
impetus would a man strike traitors , in that case ? Ah , thou canst not
imagine it : thou hast thy groceries safe in the shops , and little or no
hope of a Millennium ever coming ! -- But , indeed , as to the temper there
was in men and women , does not this one fact say enough : the height
SUSPICION had risen to ? Preternatural we often called it ; seemingly
in the language of exaggeration : but listen to the cold deposition of
witnesses . Not a musical Patriot can blow himself a snatch of melody
from the French Horn , sitting mildly pensive on the housetop , but
Mercier will recognise it to be a signal which one Plotting Committee is
making to another . Distraction has possessed Harmony herself ; lurks in
the sound of Marseillese and ca @-@ ira . ( Mercier , Nouveau Paris , vi . 63 . )
Louvet , who can see as deep into a millstone as the most , discerns that
we shall be invited back to our old Hall of the Manege , by a Deputation ;
and then the Anarchists will massacre Twenty @-@ two of us , as we walk over .
It is Pitt and Cobourg ; the gold of Pitt . -- Poor Pitt ! They little
know what work he has with his own Friends of the People ; getting them
bespied , beheaded , their habeas @-@ corpuses suspended , and his own Social
Order and strong @-@ boxes kept tight , -- to fancy him raising mobs among his
neighbours !

But the strangest fact connected with French or indeed with human
Suspicion , is perhaps this of Camille Desmoulins . Camille &apos;s head , one of
the clearest in France , has got itself so saturated through every fibre
with Preternaturalism of Suspicion , that looking back on that Twelfth of
July 1789 , when the thousands rose round him , yelling responsive at
his word in the Palais Royal Garden , and took cockades , he finds it
explicable only on this hypothesis , That they were all hired to do it ,
and set on by the Foreign and other Plotters . &apos; It was not for nothing , &apos;
says Camille with insight , &apos; that this multitude burst up round me when
I spoke ! &apos; No , not for nothing . Behind , around , before , it is one
huge Preternatural Puppet @-@ play of Plots ; Pitt pulling the wires .
( See Histoire des Brissotins , par Camille Desmoulins , a Pamphlet of
Camille &apos;s , Paris , 1793 . ) Almost I conjecture that I Camille myself am a
Plot , and wooden with wires . -- The force of insight could no further go .

Be this as it will , History remarks that the Commission of Twelve , now
clear enough as to the Plots ; and luckily having &apos; got the threads of
them all by the end , &apos; as they say , -- are launching Mandates of Arrest
rapidly in these May days ; and carrying matters with a high hand ;
resolute that the sea of troubles shall be restrained . What chief
Patriot , Section @-@ President even , is safe ? They can arrest him ; tear him
from his warm bed , because he has made irregular Section Arrestments !
They arrest Varlet Apostle of Liberty . They arrest Procureur @-@ Substitute
Hebert , Pere Duchesne ; a Magistrate of the People , sitting in Townhall ;
who , with high solemnity of martyrdom , takes leave of his colleagues ;
prompt he , to obey the Law ; and solemnly acquiescent , disappears into
prison .

The swifter fly the Sections , energetically demanding him back ;
demanding not arrestment of Popular Magistrates , but of a traitorous
Twenty @-@ two . Section comes flying after Section ; -- defiling energetic ,
with their Cambyses &apos; vein of oratory : nay the Commune itself comes ,
with Mayor Pache at its head ; and with question not of Hebert and the
Twenty @-@ two alone , but with this ominous old question made new , &quot; Can you
save the Republic , or must we do it ? &quot; To whom President Max Isnard makes
fiery answer : If by fatal chance , in any of those tumults which since
the Tenth of March are ever returning , Paris were to lift a sacrilegious
finger against the National Representation , France would rise as one
man , in never @-@ imagined vengeance , and shortly &quot; the traveller would ask ,
on which side of the Seine Paris had stood ! &quot; ( Moniteur , Seance du 25
Mai , 1793 . ) Whereat the Mountain bellows only louder , and every Gallery ;
Patriot Paris boiling round .

And Girondin Valaze has nightly conclaves at his house ; sends billets ;
&apos;Come punctually , and well armed , for there is to be business . &apos; And
Megaera women perambulate the streets , with flags , with lamentable
alleleu . ( Meillan , Memoires , p . 195 ; Buzot , pp. 69 , 84 . ) And the
Convention @-@ doors are obstructed by roaring multitudes : find @-@ spoken
hommes d &apos;etat are hustled , maltreated , as they pass ; Marat will
apostrophise you , in such death @-@ peril , and say , Thou too art of them .
If Roland ask leave to quit Paris , there is order of the day . What help ?
Substitute Hebert , Apostle Varlet , must be given back ; to be crowned
with oak @-@ garlands . The Commission of Twelve , in a Convention overwhelmed
with roaring Sections , is broken ; then on the morrow , in a Convention of
rallied Girondins , is reinstated . Dim Chaos , or the sea of troubles , is
struggling through all its elements ; writhing and chafing towards some
creation .




Chapter 3.3.IX.

Extinct .

Accordingly , on Friday , the Thirty @-@ first of May 1793 , there comes forth
into the summer sunlight one of the strangest scenes . Mayor Pache with
Municipality arrives at the Tuileries Hall of Convention ; sent for ,
Paris being in visible ferment ; and gives the strangest news .

How , in the grey of this morning , while we sat Permanent in Townhall ,
watchful for the commonweal , there entered , precisely as on a Tenth of
August , some Ninety @-@ six extraneous persons ; who declared themselves to
be in a state of Insurrection ; to be plenipotentiary Commissioners from
the Forty @-@ eight Sections , sections or members of the Sovereign People ,
all in a state of Insurrection ; and further that we , in the name of said
Sovereign in Insurrection , were dismissed from office . How we thereupon
laid off our sashes , and withdrew into the adjacent Saloon of Liberty .
How in a moment or two , we were called back ; and reinstated ; the
Sovereign pleasing to think us still worthy of confidence . Whereby ,
having taken new oath of office , we on a sudden find ourselves
Insurrectionary Magistrates , with extraneous Committee of Ninety @-@ six
sitting by us ; and a Citoyen Henriot , one whom some accuse of
Septemberism , is made Generalissimo of the National Guard ; and , since
six o &apos;clock , the tocsins ring and the drums beat : -- Under which peculiar
circumstances , what would an august National Convention please to direct
us to do ? ( Compare Debats de la Convention ( Paris , 1828 ) , iv . 187 @-@ 223 ;
Moniteur , Nos. 152 , 3 , 4 , An 1er . )

Yes , there is the question ! &quot; Break the Insurrectionary Authorities , &quot;
answers some with vehemence . Vergniaud at least will have &quot; the National
Representatives all die at their post ; &quot; this is sworn to , with ready
loud acclaim . But as to breaking the Insurrectionary Authorities , -- alas ,
while we yet debate , what sound is that ? Sound of the Alarm @-@ Cannon on
the Pont Neuf ; which it is death by the Law to fire without order from
us !

It does boom off there , nevertheless ; sending a sound through all
hearts . And the tocsins discourse stern music ; and Henriot with his
Armed Force has enveloped us ! And Section succeeds Section , the livelong
day ; demanding with Cambyses &apos; -oratory , with the rattle of muskets , That
traitors , Twenty @-@ two or more , be punished ; that the Commission of
Twelve be irrecoverably broken . The heart of the Gironde dies within
it ; distant are the Seventy @-@ two respectable Departments , this fiery
Municipality is near ! Barrere is for a middle course ; granting
something . The Commission of Twelve declares that , not waiting to be
broken , it hereby breaks itself , and is no more . Fain would Reporter
Rabaut speak his and its last @-@ words ; but he is bellowed off . Too happy
that the Twenty @-@ two are still left unviolated ! -- Vergniaud , carrying the
laws of refinement to a great length , moves , to the amazement of some ,
that &apos; the Sections of Paris have deserved well of their country . &apos; 
Whereupon , at a late hour of the evening , the deserving Sections retire
to their respective places of abode . Barrere shall report on it . With
busy quill and brain he sits , secluded ; for him no sleep to @-@ night .
Friday the last of May has ended in this manner .

The Sections have deserved well : but ought they not to deserve better ?
Faction and Girondism is struck down for the moment , and consents to be
a nullity ; but will it not , at another favourabler moment rise , still
feller ; and the Republic have to be saved in spite of it ? So reasons
Patriotism , still Permanent ; so reasons the Figure of Marat , visible in
the dim Section @-@ world , on the morrow . To the conviction of men ! -- And so
at eventide of Saturday , when Barrere had just got it all varnished in
the course of the day , and his Report was setting off in the evening
mail @-@ bags , tocsin peals out again ! Generale is beating ; armed men taking
station in the Place Vendome and elsewhere for the night ; supplied with
provisions and liquor . There under the summer stars will they wait , this
night , what is to be seen and to be done , Henriot and Townhall giving
due signal .

The Convention , at sound of generale , hastens back to its Hall ; but
to the number only of a Hundred ; and does little business , puts off
business till the morrow . The Girondins do not stir out thither , the
Girondins are abroad seeking beds . Poor Rabaut , on the morrow morning ,
returning to his post , with Louvet and some others , through streets all
in ferment , wrings his hands , ejaculating , &quot; Illa suprema dies ! &quot; ( Louvet ,
Memoires , p . 89 . ) It has become Sunday , the second day of June , year
1793 , by the old style ; by the new style , year One of Liberty , Equality ,
Fraternity . We have got to the last scene of all , that ends this history
of the Girondin Senatorship .

It seems doubtful whether any terrestrial Convention had ever met in
such circumstances as this National one now does . Tocsin is pealing ;
Barriers shut ; all Paris is on the gaze , or under arms . As many as a
Hundred Thousand under arms they count : National Force ; and the Armed
Volunteers , who should have flown to the Frontiers and La Vendee ; but
would not , treason being unpunished ; and only flew hither and thither !
So many , steady under arms , environ the National Tuileries and Garden .
There are horse , foot , artillery , sappers with beards : the artillery
one can see with their camp @-@ furnaces in this National Garden , heating
bullets red , and their match is lighted . Henriot in plumes rides , amid a
plumed Staff : all posts and issues are safe ; reserves lie out , as far as
the Wood of Boulogne ; the choicest Patriots nearest the scene . One
other circumstance we will note : that a careful Municipality , liberal
of camp @-@ furnaces , has not forgotten provision @-@ carts . No member of the
Sovereign need now go home to dinner ; but can keep rank , -- plentiful
victual circulating unsought . Does not this People understand
Insurrection ? Ye , not uninventive , Gualches ! --

Therefore let a National Representation , &apos; mandatories of the Sovereign , &apos;
take thought of it . Expulsion of your Twenty @-@ two , and your Commission of
Twelve : we stand here till it be done ! Deputation after Deputation ,
in ever stronger language , comes with that message . Barrere proposes
a middle course : -- Will not perhaps the inculpated Deputies consent to
withdraw voluntarily ; to make a generous demission , and self @-@ sacrifice
for the sake of one &apos;s country ? Isnard , repentant of that search on which
river @-@ bank Paris stood , declares himself ready to demit . Ready also
is Te @-@ Deum Fauchet ; old Dusaulx of the Bastille , &apos; vieux radoteur ,
old dotard , &apos; as Marat calls him , is still readier . On the contrary ,
Lanjuinais the Breton declares that there is one man who never will
demit voluntarily ; but will protest to the uttermost , while a voice is
left him . And he accordingly goes on protesting ; amid rage and clangor ;
Legendre crying at last : &quot; Lanjuinais , come down from the Tribune , or I
will fling thee down , ou je te jette en bas ! &quot; For matters are come
to extremity . Nay they do clutch hold of Lanjuinais , certain zealous
Mountain @-@ men ; but cannot fling him down , for he &apos; cramps himself on the
railing ; &apos; and &apos; his clothes get torn . &apos; Brave Senator , worthy of pity !
Neither will Barbaroux demit ; he &quot; has sworn to die at his post , and
will keep that oath . &quot; Whereupon the Galleries all rise with explosion ;
brandishing weapons , some of them ; and rush out saying : &quot; Allons , then ;
we must save our country ! &quot; Such a Session is this of Sunday the second
of June .

Churches fill , over Christian Europe , and then empty themselves ; but
this Convention empties not , the while : a day of shrieking contention ,
of agony , humiliation and tearing of coatskirts ; illa suprema dies !
Round stand Henriot and his Hundred Thousand , copiously refreshed
from tray and basket : nay he is &apos; distributing five francs a @-@ piece ; &apos; we
Girondins saw it with our eyes ; five francs to keep them in heart ! And
distraction of armed riot encumbers our borders , jangles at our Bar ; we
are prisoners in our own Hall : Bishop Gregoire could not get out for
a besoin actuel without four gendarmes to wait on him ! What is the
character of a National Representative become ? And now the sunlight
falls yellower on western windows , and the chimney @-@ tops are flinging
longer shadows ; the refreshed Hundred Thousand , nor their shadows , stir
not ! What to resolve on ? Motion rises , superfluous one would think , That
the Convention go forth in a body ; ascertain with its own eyes
whether it is free or not . Lo , therefore , from the Eastern Gate of the
Tuileries , a distressed Convention issuing ; handsome Herault Sechelles
at their head ; he with hat on , in sign of public calamity , the rest
bareheaded , -- towards the Gate of the Carrousel ; wondrous to see : towards
Henriot and his plumed staff . &quot; In the name of the National Convention ,
make way ! &quot; Not an inch of the way does Henriot make : &quot; I receive no
orders , till the Sovereign , yours and mine , has been obeyed . &quot; The
Convention presses on ; Henriot prances back , with his staff , some
fifteen paces , &quot; To arms ! Cannoneers to your guns ! &quot; -- flashes out his
puissant sword , as the Staff all do , and the Hussars all do . Cannoneers
brandish the lit match ; Infantry present arms , -- alas , in the level way ,
as if for firing ! Hatted Herault leads his distressed flock , through
their pinfold of a Tuileries again ; across the Garden , to the Gate on
the opposite side . Here is Feuillans Terrace , alas , there is our old
Salle de Manege ; but neither at this Gate of the Pont Tournant is there
egress . Try the other ; and the other : no egress ! We wander disconsolate
through armed ranks ; who indeed salute with Live the Republic , but also
with Die the Gironde . Other such sight , in the year One of Liberty , the
westering sun never saw .

And now behold Marat meets us ; for he lagged in this Suppliant
Procession of ours : he has got some hundred elect Patriots at his heels :
he orders us in the Sovereign &apos;s name to return to our place , and do
as we are bidden and bound . The Convention returns . &quot; Does not the
Convention , &quot; says Couthon with a singular power of face , &quot; see that it
is free ? &quot; -- none but friends round it ? The Convention , overflowing with
friends and armed Sectioners , proceeds to vote as bidden . Many will not
vote , but remain silent ; some one or two protest , in words : the
Mountain has a clear unanimity . Commission of Twelve , and the denounced
Twenty @-@ two , to whom we add Ex @-@ Ministers Claviere and Lebrun : these , with
some slight extempore alterations ( this or that orator proposing ,
but Marat disposing ) , are voted to be under &apos; Arrestment in their own
houses . &apos; Brissot , Buzot , Vergniaud , Guadet , Louvet , Gensonne , Barbaroux ,
Lasource , Lanjuinais , Rabaut , -- Thirty @-@ two , by the tale ; all that we
have known as Girondins , and more than we have known . They , &apos; under the
safeguard of the French People ; &apos; by and by , under the safeguard of
two Gendarmes each , shall dwell peaceably in their own houses ; as
Non @-@ Senators ; till further order . Herewith ends Seance of Sunday the
second of June 1793 .

At ten o &apos;clock , under mild stars , the Hundred Thousand , their work well
finished , turn homewards . This same day , Central Insurrection Committee
has arrested Madame Roland ; imprisoned her in the Abbaye . Roland has
fled , no one knows whither .

Thus fell the Girondins , by Insurrection ; and became extinct as a Party :
not without a sigh from most Historians . The men were men of parts , of
Philosophic culture , decent behaviour ; not condemnable in that they were
Pedants and had not better parts ; not condemnable , but most unfortunate .
They wanted a Republic of the Virtues , wherein themselves should be
head ; and they could only get a Republic of the Strengths , wherein
others than they were head .

For the rest , Barrere shall make Report of it . The night concludes with
a &apos; civic promenade by torchlight : &apos; ( Buzot , Memoires , p . 310 . See Pieces
Justificatives , of Narratives , Commentaries , &amp; c. in Buzot , Louvet ,
Meillan : Documens Complementaires , in Hist . Parl. xxviii . 1 @-@ 78 . ) surely
the true reign of Fraternity is now not far ?




BOOK 3.IV.

TERROR


Chapter 3.4.I.

Charlotte Corday .

In the leafy months of June and July , several French Departments
germinate a set of rebellious paper @-@ leaves , named Proclamations ,
Resolutions , Journals , or Diurnals &apos; of the Union for Resistance to
Oppression . &apos; In particular , the Town of Caen , in Calvados , sees its
paper @-@ leaf of Bulletin de Caen suddenly bud , suddenly establish
itself as Newspaper there ; under the Editorship of Girondin National
Representatives !

For among the proscribed Girondins are certain of a more desperate
humour . Some , as Vergniaud , Valaze , Gensonne , &apos; arrested in their own
houses &apos; will await with stoical resignation what the issue may be . Some ,
as Brissot , Rabaut , will take to flight , to concealment ; which , as the
Paris Barriers are opened again in a day or two , is not yet difficult .
But others there are who will rush , with Buzot , to Calvados ; or far over
France , to Lyons , Toulon , Nantes and elsewhither , and then rendezvous
at Caen : to awaken as with war @-@ trumpet the respectable Departments ; and
strike down an anarchic Mountain Faction ; at least not yield without a
stroke at it . Of this latter temper we count some score or more , of the
Arrested , and of the Not @-@ yet @-@ arrested ; a Buzot , a Barbaroux , Louvet ,
Guadet , Petion , who have escaped from Arrestment in their own homes ;
a Salles , a Pythagorean Valady , a Duchatel , the Duchatel that came in
blanket and nightcap to vote for the life of Louis , who have escaped
from danger and likelihood of Arrestment . These , to the number at one
time of Twenty @-@ seven , do accordingly lodge here , at the &apos; Intendance ,
or Departmental Mansion , &apos; of the Town of Caen ; welcomed by Persons in
Authority ; welcomed and defrayed , having no money of their own . And the
Bulletin de Caen comes forth , with the most animating paragraphs : How
the Bourdeaux Department , the Lyons Department , this Department after
the other is declaring itself ; sixty , or say sixty @-@ nine , or seventy @-@ two
( Meillan , p . 72 , 73 ; Louvet , p . 129 . ) respectable Departments either
declaring , or ready to declare . Nay Marseilles , it seems , will march on
Paris by itself , if need be . So has Marseilles Town said , That she
will march . But on the other hand , that Montelimart Town has said , No
thoroughfare ; and means even to &apos; bury herself &apos; under her own stone and
mortar first -- of this be no mention in Bulletin of Caen .

Such animating paragraphs we read in this Newspaper ; and fervours , and
eloquent sarcasm : tirades against the Mountain , frame pen of Deputy
Salles ; which resemble , say friends , Pascal &apos;s Provincials . What is
more to the purpose , these Girondins have got a General in chief , one
Wimpfen , formerly under Dumouriez ; also a secondary questionable General
Puisaye , and others ; and are doing their best to raise a force for war .
National Volunteers , whosoever is of right heart : gather in , ye National
Volunteers , friends of Liberty ; from our Calvados Townships , from the
Eure , from Brittany , from far and near ; forward to Paris , and extinguish
Anarchy ! Thus at Caen , in the early July days , there is a drumming and
parading , a perorating and consulting : Staff and Army ; Council ; Club of
Carabots , Anti @-@ jacobin friends of Freedom , to denounce atrocious Marat .
With all which , and the editing of Bulletins , a National Representative
has his hands full .

At Caen it is most animated ; and , as one hopes , more or less animated in
the &apos; Seventy @-@ two Departments that adhere to us . &apos; And in a France begirt
with Cimmerian invading Coalitions , and torn with an internal La Vendee ,
this is the conclusion we have arrived at : to put down Anarchy by Civil
War ! Durum et durum , the Proverb says , non faciunt murum . La Vendee
burns : Santerre can do nothing there ; he may return home and brew beer .
Cimmerian bombshells fly all along the North . That Siege of Mentz is
become famed ; -- lovers of the Picturesque ( as Goethe will testify ) ,
washed country @-@ people of both sexes , stroll thither on Sundays , to see
the artillery work and counterwork ; &apos; you only duck a little while
the shot whizzes past . &apos; ( Belagerung von Mainz , Goethe &apos;s Werke , xxx .
278 @-@ 334 . ) Conde is capitulating to the Austrians ; Royal Highness of
York , these several weeks , fiercely batters Valenciennes . For , alas ,
our fortified Camp of Famars was stormed ; General Dampierre was killed ;
General Custine was blamed , -- and indeed is now come to Paris to give
&apos;explanations . &apos; 

Against all which the Mountain and atrocious Marat must even make head
as they can . They , anarchic Convention as they are , publish Decrees ,
expostulatory , explanatory , yet not without severity ; they ray forth
Commissioners , singly or in pairs , the olive @-@ branch in one hand , yet the
sword in the other . Commissioners come even to Caen ; but without
effect . Mathematical Romme , and Prieur named of the Cote d &apos;Or , venturing
thither , with their olive and sword , are packed into prison : there may
Romme lie , under lock and key , &apos; for fifty days ; &apos; and meditate his New
Calendar , if he please . Cimmeria and Civil War ! Never was Republic One
and Indivisible at a lower ebb . --

Amid which dim ferment of Caen and the World , History specially notices
one thing : in the lobby of the Mansion de l &apos;Intendance , where busy
Deputies are coming and going , a young Lady with an aged valet , taking
grave graceful leave of Deputy Barbaroux . ( Meillan , p.75 ; Louvet , p .
114 . ) She is of stately Norman figure ; in her twenty @-@ fifth year ; of
beautiful still countenance : her name is Charlotte Corday , heretofore
styled d &apos;Armans , while Nobility still was . Barbaroux has given her
a Note to Deputy Duperret , -- him who once drew his sword in the
effervescence . Apparently she will to Paris on some errand ? &apos; She was
a Republican before the Revolution , and never wanted energy . &apos; A
completeness , a decision is in this fair female Figure : &apos; by energy
she means the spirit that will prompt one to sacrifice himself for his
country . &apos; What if she , this fair young Charlotte , had emerged from
her secluded stillness , suddenly like a Star ; cruel @-@ lovely , with
half @-@ angelic , half @-@ demonic splendour ; to gleam for a moment , and in a
moment be extinguished : to be held in memory , so bright complete was
she , through long centuries ! -- Quitting Cimmerian Coalitions without , and
the dim @-@ simmering Twenty @-@ five millions within , History will look fixedly
at this one fair Apparition of a Charlotte Corday ; will note whither
Charlotte moves , how the little Life burns forth so radiant , then
vanishes swallowed of the Night .

With Barbaroux &apos;s Note of Introduction , and slight stock of luggage ,
we see Charlotte , on Tuesday the ninth of July , seated in the Caen
Diligence , with a place for Paris . None takes farewell of her , wishes
her Good @-@ journey : her Father will find a line left , signifying that she
is gone to England , that he must pardon her and forget her . The drowsy
Diligence lumbers along ; amid drowsy talk of Politics , and praise of the
Mountain ; in which she mingles not ; all night , all day , and again
all night . On Thursday , not long before none , we are at the Bridge of
Neuilly ; here is Paris with her thousand black domes , -- the goal and
purpose of thy journey ! Arrived at the Inn de la Providence in the Rue
des Vieux Augustins , Charlotte demands a room ; hastens to bed ; sleeps
all afternoon and night , till the morrow morning .

On the morrow morning , she delivers her Note to Duperret . It relates to
certain Family Papers which are in the Minister of the Interior &apos;s hand ;
which a Nun at Caen , an old Convent @-@ friend of Charlotte &apos;s , has need of ;
which Duperret shall assist her in getting : this then was Charlotte &apos;s
errand to Paris ? She has finished this , in the course of Friday ; -- yet
says nothing of returning . She has seen and silently investigated
several things . The Convention , in bodily reality , she has seen ; what
the Mountain is like . The living physiognomy of Marat she could not see ;
he is sick at present , and confined to home .

About eight on the Saturday morning , she purchases a large sheath @-@ knife
in the Palais Royal ; then straightway , in the Place des Victoires , takes
a hackney @-@ coach : &quot; To the Rue de l &apos;Ecole de Medecine , No. 44 . &quot; It is the
residence of the Citoyen Marat ! -- The Citoyen Marat is ill , and cannot
be seen ; which seems to disappoint her much . Her business is with Marat ,
then ? Hapless beautiful Charlotte ; hapless squalid Marat ! From Caen in
the utmost West , from Neuchatel in the utmost East , they two are
drawing nigh each other ; they two have , very strangely , business
together . -- Charlotte , returning to her Inn , despatches a short Note to
Marat ; signifying that she is from Caen , the seat of rebellion ; that she
desires earnestly to see him , and &apos; will put it in his power to do France
a great service . &apos; No answer . Charlotte writes another Note , still
more pressing ; sets out with it by coach , about seven in the evening ,
herself . Tired day @-@ labourers have again finished their Week ; huge Paris
is circling and simmering , manifold , according to its vague wont : this
one fair Figure has decision in it ; drives straight , -- towards a purpose .

It is yellow July evening , we say , the thirteenth of the month ; eve of
the Bastille day , -- when &apos; M. Marat , &apos; four years ago , in the crowd of the
Pont Neuf , shrewdly required of that Besenval Hussar @-@ party , which had
such friendly dispositions , &quot; to dismount , and give up their arms , then ; &quot;
and became notable among Patriot men ! Four years : what a road he has
travelled ; -- and sits now , about half @-@ past seven of the clock , stewing
in slipper @-@ bath ; sore afflicted ; ill of Revolution Fever , -- of what other
malady this History had rather not name . Excessively sick and worn , poor
man : with precisely elevenpence @-@ halfpenny of ready money , in paper ; with
slipper @-@ bath ; strong three @-@ footed stool for writing on , the while ; and a
squalid -- Washerwoman , one may call her : that is his civic establishment
in Medical @-@ School Street ; thither and not elsewhither has his road led
him . Not to the reign of Brotherhood and Perfect Felicity ; yet surely
on the way towards that ? -- Hark , a rap again ! A musical woman &apos;s @-@ voice ,
refusing to be rejected : it is the Citoyenne who would do France a
service . Marat , recognising from within , cries , Admit her . Charlotte
Corday is admitted .

Citoyen Marat , I am from Caen the seat of rebellion , and wished to speak
with you . -- Be seated , mon enfant . Now what are the Traitors doing at
Caen ? What Deputies are at Caen ? -- Charlotte names some Deputies . &quot; Their
heads shall fall within a fortnight , &quot; croaks the eager People &apos;s @-@ Friend ,
clutching his tablets to write : Barbaroux , Petion , writes he with
bare shrunk arm , turning aside in the bath : Petion , and Louvet ,
and -- Charlotte has drawn her knife from the sheath ; plunges it , with one
sure stroke , into the writer &apos;s heart . &quot; A moi , chere amie , Help , dear ! &quot;
No more could the Death @-@ choked say or shriek . The helpful Washerwoman
running in , there is no Friend of the People , or Friend of the
Washerwoman , left ; but his life with a groan gushes out , indignant , to
the shades below . ( Moniteur , Nos. 197 , 198 , 199 ; Hist . Parl. xxviii .
301 @-@ 5 ; Deux Amis , x . 368 @-@ 374 . )

And so Marat People &apos;s @-@ Friend is ended ; the lone Stylites has got hurled
down suddenly from his Pillar , -- whither He that made him does know .
Patriot Paris may sound triple and tenfold , in dole and wail ; re @-@ echoed
by Patriot France ; and the Convention , &apos; Chabot pale with terror
declaring that they are to be all assassinated , &apos; may decree him Pantheon
Honours , Public Funeral , Mirabeau &apos;s dust making way for him ; and Jacobin
Societies , in lamentable oratory , summing up his character , parallel him
to One , whom they think it honour to call &apos; the good Sansculotte , &apos; -- whom
we name not here . ( See Eloge funebre de Jean @-@ Paul Marat , prononce a
Strasbourg in Barbaroux , p . 125 @-@ 131 ; Mercier , &amp; c . ) Also a Chapel may
be made , for the urn that holds his Heart , in the Place du Carrousel ;
and new @-@ born children be named Marat ; and Lago @-@ de @-@ Como Hawkers bake
mountains of stucco into unbeautiful Busts ; and David paint his Picture ,
or Death @-@ scene ; and such other Apotheosis take place as the human
genius , in these circumstances , can devise : but Marat returns no more
to the light of this Sun . One sole circumstance we have read with clear
sympathy , in the old Moniteur Newspaper : how Marat &apos;s brother comes from
Neuchatel to ask of the Convention &apos; that the deceased Jean @-@ Paul Marat &apos;s
musket be given him . &apos; ( Seance du 16 Septembre 1793 . ) For Marat too had
a brother , and natural affections ; and was wrapt once in
swaddling @-@ clothes , and slept safe in a cradle like the rest of us . Ye
children of men ! -- A sister of his , they say , lives still to this day in
Paris .

As for Charlotte Corday her work is accomplished ; the recompense of it
is near and sure . The chere amie , and neighbours of the house , flying
at her , she &apos; overturns some movables , &apos; entrenches herself till the
gendarmes arrive ; then quietly surrenders ; goes quietly to the Abbaye
Prison : she alone quiet , all Paris sounding in wonder , in rage or
admiration , round her . Duperret is put in arrest , on account of her ; his
Papers sealed , -- which may lead to consequences . Fauchet , in like manner ;
though Fauchet had not so much as heard of her . Charlotte , confronted
with these two Deputies , praises the grave firmness of Duperret ,
censures the dejection of Fauchet .

On Wednesday morning , the thronged Palais de Justice and Revolutionary
Tribunal can see her face ; beautiful and calm : she dates it &apos; fourth day
of the Preparation of Peace . &apos; A strange murmur ran through the Hall , at
sight of her ; you could not say of what character . ( Proces de Charlotte
Corday , &amp; c . Hist . Parl. xxviii . 311 @-@ 338 . ) Tinville has his indictments
and tape @-@ papers the cutler of the Palais Royal will testify that he
sold her the sheath @-@ knife ; &quot; all these details are needless , &quot; interrupted
Charlotte ; &quot; it is I that killed Marat . &quot; By whose instigation ? -- &quot; By no
one &apos;s . &quot; What tempted you , then ? His crimes . &quot; I killed one man , &quot; added
she , raising her voice extremely ( extremement ) , as they went on with
their questions , &quot; I killed one man to save a hundred thousand ; a villain
to save innocents ; a savage wild @-@ beast to give repose to my country . I
was a Republican before the Revolution ; I never wanted energy . &quot; There
is therefore nothing to be said . The public gazes astonished : the hasty
limners sketch her features , Charlotte not disapproving ; the men of law
proceed with their formalities . The doom is Death as a murderess . To
her Advocate she gives thanks ; in gentle phrase , in high @-@ flown classical
spirit . To the Priest they send her she gives thanks ; but needs not any
shriving , or ghostly or other aid from him .

On this same evening , therefore , about half @-@ past seven o &apos;clock , from
the gate of the Conciergerie , to a City all on tiptoe , the fatal Cart
issues : seated on it a fair young creature , sheeted in red smock of
Murderess ; so beautiful , serene , so full of life ; journeying towards
death , -- alone amid the world . Many take off their hats , saluting
reverently ; for what heart but must be touched ? ( Deux Amis , x . 374 @-@ 384 . )
Others growl and howl . Adam Lux , of Mentz , declares that she is greater
than Brutus ; that it were beautiful to die with her : the head of this
young man seems turned . At the Place de la Revolution , the countenance
of Charlotte wears the same still smile . The executioners proceed to
bind her feet ; she resists , thinking it meant as an insult ; on a word
of explanation , she submits with cheerful apology . As the last act , all
being now ready , they take the neckerchief from her neck : a blush of
maidenly shame overspreads that fair face and neck ; the cheeks were
still tinged with it , when the executioner lifted the severed head , to
shew it to the people . &apos; It is most true , &apos; says Foster , &apos; that he struck
the cheek insultingly ; for I saw it with my eyes : the Police imprisoned
him for it . &apos; ( Briefwechsel , i . 508 . )

In this manner have the Beautifullest and the Squalidest come in
collision , and extinguished one another . Jean @-@ Paul Marat and Marie @-@ Anne
Charlotte Corday both , suddenly , are no more . &apos; Day of the Preparation of
Peace ? &apos; Alas , how were peace possible or preparable , while , for example ,
the hearts of lovely Maidens , in their convent @-@ stillness , are dreaming
not of Love @-@ paradises , and the light of Life ; but of Codrus &apos; -sacrifices ,
and death well earned ? That Twenty @-@ five million hearts have got to such
temper , this is the Anarchy ; the soul of it lies in this : whereof
not peace can be the embodyment ! The death of Marat , whetting old
animosities tenfold , will be worse than any life . O ye hapless Two ,
mutually extinctive , the Beautiful and the Squalid , sleep ye well , -- in
the Mother &apos;s bosom that bore you both !

This was the History of Charlotte Corday ; most definite , most complete ;
angelic @-@ demonic : like a Star ! Adam Lux goes home , half @-@ delirious ; to
pour forth his Apotheosis of her , in paper and print ; to propose that
she have a statue with this inscription , Greater than Brutus . Friends
represent his danger ; Lux is reckless ; thinks it were beautiful to die
with her .



Chapter 3.4.II.

In Civil War .

But during these same hours , another guillotine is at work , on another :
Charlotte , for the Girondins , dies at Paris to @-@ day ; Chalier , by the
Girondins , dies at Lyons to @-@ morrow .

From rumbling of cannon along the streets of that City , it has come
to firing of them , to rabid fighting : Nievre @-@ Chol and the Girondins
triumph ; -- behind whom there is , as everywhere , a Royalist Faction
waiting to strike in . Trouble enough at Lyons ; and the dominant party
carrying it with a high hand ! For indeed , the whole South is astir ;
incarcerating Jacobins ; arming for Girondins : wherefore we have got
a &apos; Congress of Lyons ; &apos; also a &apos; Revolutionary Tribunal of Lyons , &apos;
and Anarchists shall tremble . So Chalier was soon found guilty , of
Jacobinism , of murderous Plot , &apos; address with drawn dagger on the sixth
of February last ; &apos; and , on the morrow , he also travels his final road ,
along the streets of Lyons , &apos; by the side of an ecclesiastic , with whom
he seems to speak earnestly , &apos; -- the axe now glittering high . He could
weep , in old years , this man , and &apos; fall on his knees on the pavement , &apos;
blessing Heaven at sight of Federation Programs or like ; then he
pilgrimed to Paris , to worship Marat and the Mountain : now Marat and
he are both gone ; -- we said he could not end well . Jacobinism groans
inwardly , at Lyons ; but dare not outwardly . Chalier , when the Tribunal
sentenced him , made answer : &quot; My death will cost this City dear . &quot;

Montelimart Town is not buried under its ruins ; yet Marseilles is
actually marching , under order of a &apos; Lyons Congress ; &apos; is incarcerating
Patriots ; the very Royalists now shewing face . Against which a General
Cartaux fights , though in small force ; and with him an Artillery Major ,
of the name of -- Napoleon Buonaparte . This Napoleon , to prove that the
Marseillese have no chance ultimately , not only fights but writes ;
publishes his Supper of Beaucaire , a Dialogue which has become curious .
( See Hazlitt , ii . 529 @-@ 41 . ) Unfortunate Cities , with their actions and
their reactions ! Violence to be paid with violence in geometrical ratio ;
Royalism and Anarchism both striking in ; -- the final net @-@ amount of which
geometrical series , what man shall sum ?

The Bar of Iron has never yet floated in Marseilles Harbour ; but the
Body of Rebecqui was found floating , self @-@ drowned there . Hot Rebecqui
seeing how confusion deepened , and Respectability grew poisoned with
Royalism , felt that there was no refuge for a Republican but death .
Rebecqui disappeared : no one knew whither ; till , one morning , they found
the empty case or body of him risen to the top , tumbling on the salt
waves ; ( Barbaroux , p . 29 . ) and perceived that Rebecqui had withdrawn
forever . -- Toulon likewise is incarcerating Patriots ; sending delegates
to Congress ; intriguing , in case of necessity , with the Royalists and
English . Montpellier , Bourdeaux , Nantes : all France , that is not under
the swoop of Austria and Cimmeria , seems rushing into madness , and
suicidal ruin . The Mountain labours ; like a volcano in a burning
volcanic Land . Convention Committees , of Surety , of Salvation , are busy
night and day : Convention Commissioners whirl on all highways ; bearing
olive @-@ branch and sword , or now perhaps sword only . Chaumette and
Municipals come daily to the Tuileries demanding a Constitution : it is
some weeks now since he resolved , in Townhall , that a Deputation &apos; should
go every day &apos; and demand a Constitution , till one were got ; ( Deux Amis ,
x . 345 . ) whereby suicidal France might rally and pacify itself ; a thing
inexpressibly desirable .

This then is the fruit your Anti @-@ anarchic Girondins have got from
that Levying of War in Calvados ? This fruit , we may say ; and no other
whatsoever . For indeed , before either Charlotte &apos;s or Chalier &apos;s head had
fallen , the Calvados War itself had , as it were , vanished , dreamlike , in
a shriek ! With &apos; seventy @-@ two Departments &apos; on one &apos;s side , one might have
hoped better things . But it turns out that Respectabilities , though they
will vote , will not fight . Possession is always nine points in Law ; but
in Lawsuits of this kind , one may say , it is ninety @-@ and @-@ nine points . Men
do what they were wont to do ; and have immense irresolution and inertia :
they obey him who has the symbols that claim obedience . Consider what ,
in modern society , this one fact means : the Metropolis is with our
enemies ! Metropolis , Mother @-@ city ; rightly so named : all the rest are but
as her children , her nurselings . Why , there is not a leathern Diligence ,
with its post @-@ bags and luggage @-@ boots , that lumbers out from her , but
is as a huge life @-@ pulse ; she is the heart of all . Cut short that one
leathern Diligence , how much is cut short ! -- General Wimpfen , looking
practically into the matter , can see nothing for it but that one should
fall back on Royalism ; get into communication with Pitt ! Dark innuendoes
he flings out , to that effect : whereat we Girondins start , horrorstruck .
He produces as his Second in command a certain &apos; Ci @-@ devant , &apos; one Comte
Puisaye ; entirely unknown to Louvet ; greatly suspected by him .

Few wars , accordingly , were ever levied of a more insufficient character
than this of Calvados . He that is curious in such things may read
the details of it in the Memoirs of that same Ci @-@ devant Puisaye , the
much @-@ enduring man and Royalist : How our Girondin National Forces ,
marching off with plenty of wind @-@ music , were drawn out about the old
Chateau of Brecourt , in the wood @-@ country near Vernon , to meet the
Mountain National forces advancing from Paris . How on the fifteenth
afternoon of July , they did meet , -- and , as it were , shrieked mutually ,
and took mutually to flight without loss . How Puisaye thereafter ,
for the Mountain Nationals fled first , and we thought ourselves the
victors , -- was roused from his warm bed in the Castle of Brecourt ; and
had to gallop without boots ; our Nationals , in the night @-@ watches , having
fallen unexpectedly into sauve qui peut : -- and in brief the Calvados War
had burnt priming ; and the only question now was , Whitherward to vanish ,
in what hole to hide oneself ! ( Memoires de Puisaye ( London , 1803 ) , ii .
142 @-@ 67 . )

The National Volunteers rush homewards , faster than they came . The
Seventy @-@ two Respectable Departments , says Meillan , &apos; all turned round ,
and forsook us , in the space of four @-@ and @-@ twenty hours . &apos; Unhappy those
who , as at Lyons for instance , have gone too far for turning ! &apos; One
morning , &apos; we find placarded on our Intendance Mansion , the Decree of
Convention which casts us Hors la loi , into Outlawry : placarded by
our Caen Magistrates ; -- clear hint that we also are to vanish . Vanish ,
indeed : but whitherward ? Gorsas has friends in Rennes ; he will hide
there , -- unhappily will not lie hid . Guadet , Lanjuinais are on cross
roads ; making for Bourdeaux . To Bourdeaux ! cries the general voice , of
Valour alike and of Despair . Some flag of Respectability still floats
there , or is thought to float .

Thitherward therefore ; each as he can ! Eleven of these ill @-@ fated
Deputies , among whom we may count , as twelfth , Friend Riouffe the Man of
Letters , do an original thing . Take the uniform of National Volunteers ,
and retreat southward with the Breton Battalion , as private soldiers of
that corps . These brave Bretons had stood truer by us than any other .
Nevertheless , at the end of a day or two , they also do now get dubious ,
self @-@ divided ; we must part from them ; and , with some half @-@ dozen as
convoy or guide , retreat by ourselves , -- a solitary marching detachment ,
through waste regions of the West . ( Louvet , pp. 101 @-@ 37 ; Meillan , pp. 81,
241 @-@ 70 . )



Chapter 3.4.III.

Retreat of the Eleven .

It is one of the notablest Retreats , this of the Eleven , that History
presents : The handful of forlorn Legislators retreating there ,
continually , with shouldered firelock and well @-@ filled cartridge @-@ box , in
the yellow autumn ; long hundreds of miles between them and Bourdeaux ;
the country all getting hostile , suspicious of the truth ; simmering and
buzzing on all sides , more and more . Louvet has preserved the Itinerary
of it ; a piece worth all the rest he ever wrote .

O virtuous Petion , with thy early @-@ white head , O brave young Barbaroux ,
has it come to this ? Weary ways , worn shoes , light purse ; -- encompassed
with perils as with a sea ! Revolutionary Committees are in every
Township ; of Jacobin temper ; our friends all cowed , our cause the losing
one . In the Borough of Moncontour , by ill chance , it is market @-@ day :
to the gaping public such transit of a solitary Marching Detachment
is suspicious ; we have need of energy , of promptitude and luck , to be
allowed to march through . Hasten , ye weary pilgrims ! The country is
getting up ; noise of you is bruited day after day , a solitary Twelve
retreating in this mysterious manner : with every new day , a wider wave
of inquisitive pursuing tumult is stirred up till the whole West will
be in motion . &apos; Cussy is tormented with gout , Buzot is too fat for
marching . &apos; Riouffe , blistered , bleeding , marching only on tiptoe ;
Barbaroux limps with sprained ancle , yet ever cheery , full of hope and
valour . Light Louvet glances hare @-@ eyed , not hare @-@ hearted : only virtuous
Petion &apos;s serenity &apos; was but once seen ruffled . &apos; ( Meillan , pp. 119 @-@ 137 . )
They lie in straw @-@ lofts , in woody brakes ; rudest paillasse on the floor
of a secret friend is luxury . They are seized in the dead of night by
Jacobin mayors and tap of drum ; get off by firm countenance , rattle of
muskets , and ready wit .

Of Bourdeaux , through fiery La Vendee and the long geographical spaces
that remain , it were madness to think : well , if you can get to Quimper
on the sea @-@ coast , and take shipping there . Faster , ever faster !
Before the end of the march , so hot has the country grown , it is found
advisable to march all night . They do it ; under the still night @-@ canopy
they plod along ; -- and yet behold , Rumour has outplodded them . In
the paltry Village of Carhaix ( be its thatched huts , and bottomless
peat @-@ bogs , long notable to the Traveller ) , one is astonished to find
light still glimmering : citizens are awake , with rush @-@ lights burning , in
that nook of the terrestrial Planet ; as we traverse swiftly the one
poor street , a voice is heard saying , &quot; There they are , Les voila qui
passent ! &quot; ( Louvet , pp. 138 @-@ 164 . ) Swifter , ye doomed lame Twelve : speed
ere they can arm ; gain the Woods of Quimper before day , and lie squatted
there !

The doomed Twelve do it ; though with difficulty , with loss of road , with
peril , and the mistakes of a night . In Quimper are Girondin friends , who
perhaps will harbour the homeless , till a Bourdeaux ship weigh . Wayworn ,
heartworn , in agony of suspense , till Quimper friendship get warning ,
they lie there , squatted under the thick wet boscage ; suspicious of the
face of man . Some pity to the brave ; to the unhappy ! Unhappiest of all
Legislators , O when ye packed your luggage , some score , or two @-@ score
months ago ; and mounted this or the other leathern vehicle , to
be Conscript Fathers of a regenerated France , and reap deathless
laurels , -- did ye think your journey was to lead hither ? The Quimper
Samaritans find them squatted ; lift them up to help and comfort ; will
hide them in sure places . Thence let them dissipate gradually ; or there
they can lie quiet , and write Memoirs , till a Bourdeaux ship sail .

And thus , in Calvados all is dissipated ; Romme is out of prison ,
meditating his Calendar ; ringleaders are locked in his room . At Caen
the Corday family mourns in silence ; Buzot &apos;s House is a heap of dust
and demolition ; and amid the rubbish sticks a Gallows , with this
inscription , Here dwelt the Traitor Buzot who conspired against the
Republic . Buzot and the other vanished Deputies are hors la loi , as we
saw ; their lives free to take where they can be found . The worse fares
it with the poor Arrested visible Deputies at Paris . &apos; Arrestment at
home &apos; threatens to become &apos; Confinement in the Luxembourg ; &apos; to end :
where ? For example , what pale @-@ visaged thin man is this , journeying
towards Switzerland as a Merchant of Neuchatel , whom they arrest in
the town of Moulins ? To Revolutionary Committee he is suspect . To
Revolutionary Committee , on probing the matter , he is evidently : Deputy
Brissot ! Back to thy Arrestment , poor Brissot ; or indeed to strait
confinement , -- whither others are fared to follow . Rabaut has built
himself a false @-@ partition , in a friend &apos;s house ; lives , in invisible
darkness , between two walls . It will end , this same Arrestment business ,
in Prison , and the Revolutionary Tribunal .

Nor must we forget Duperret , and the seal put on his papers by reason of
Charlotte . One Paper is there , fit to breed woe enough : A secret solemn
Protest against that suprema dies of the Second of June ! This Secret
Protest our poor Duperret had drawn up , the same week , in all plainness
of speech ; waiting the time for publishing it : to which Secret Protest
his signature , and that of other honourable Deputies not a few , stands
legibly appended . And now , if the seals were once broken , the
Mountain still victorious ? Such Protestors , your Merciers , Bailleuls ,
Seventy @-@ three by the tale , what yet remains of Respectable Girondism in
the Convention , may tremble to think ! -- These are the fruits of levying
civil war .

Also we find , that , in these last days of July , the famed Siege of Mentz
is finished ; the Garrison to march out with honours of war ; not to serve
against the Coalition for a year ! Lovers of the Picturesque , and
Goethe standing on the Chaussee of Mentz , saw , with due interest , the
Procession issuing forth , in all solemnity :

&apos;Escorted by Prussian horse came first the French Garrison . Nothing
could look stranger than this latter : a column of Marseillese , slight ,
swarthy , party @-@ coloured , in patched clothes , came tripping on ; -- as if
King Edwin had opened the Dwarf Hill , and sent out his nimble Host
of Dwarfs . Next followed regular troops ; serious , sullen ; not as if
downcast or ashamed . But the remarkablest appearance , which struck every
one , was that of the Chasers ( Chasseurs ) coming out mounted : they had
advanced quite silent to where we stood , when their Band struck up
the Marseillaise . This Revolutionary Te @-@ Deum has in itself something
mournful and bodeful , however briskly played ; but at present they gave
it in altogether slow time , proportionate to the creeping step they rode
at . It was piercing and fearful , and a most serious @-@ looking thing , as
these cavaliers , long , lean men , of a certain age , with mien suitable
to the music , came pacing on : singly you might have likened them to Don
Quixote ; in mass , they were highly dignified .

&apos;But now a single troop became notable : that of the Commissioners or
Representans . Merlin of Thionville , in hussar uniform , distinguishing
himself by wild beard and look , had another person in similar costume on
his left ; the crowd shouted out , with rage , at sight of this latter , the
name of a Jacobin Townsman and Clubbist ; and shook itself to seize him .
Merlin drew bridle ; referred to his dignity as French Representative , to
the vengeance that should follow any injury done ; he would advise every
one to compose himself , for this was not the last time they would see
him here . ( Belagerung von Maintz , Goethe &apos;s Werke , xxx . 315 . ) Thus rode
Merlin ; threatening in defeat . But what now shall stem that tide of
Prussians setting in through the open North @-@ East ? &apos; Lucky , if fortified
Lines of Weissembourg , and impassibilities of Vosges Mountains , confine
it to French Alsace , keep it from submerging the very heart of the
country !

Furthermore , precisely in the same days , Valenciennes Siege is finished ,
in the North @-@ West : -- fallen , under the red hail of York ! Conde fell some
fortnight since . Cimmerian Coalition presses on . What seems very notable
too , on all these captured French Towns there flies not the Royalist
fleur @-@ de @-@ lys , in the name of a new Louis the Pretender ; but the Austrian
flag flies ; as if Austria meant to keep them for herself ! Perhaps
General Custines , still in Paris , can give some explanation of the fall
of these strong @-@ places ? Mother Society , from tribune and gallery , growls
loud that he ought to do it ; -- remarks , however , in a splenetic manner
that &apos; the Monsieurs of the Palais Royal &apos; are calling , Long @-@ life to this
General .

The Mother Society , purged now , by successive &apos; scrutinies or
epurations , &apos; from all taint of Girondism , has become a great Authority :
what we can call shield @-@ bearer , or bottle @-@ holder , nay call it fugleman ,
to the purged National Convention itself . The Jacobins Debates are
reported in the Moniteur , like Parliamentary ones .



Chapter 3.4.IV.

O Nature .

But looking more specially into Paris City , what is this that History ,
on the 10th of August , Year One of Liberty , &apos; by old @-@ style , year 1793 , &apos;
discerns there ? Praised be the Heavens , a new Feast of Pikes !

For Chaumette &apos;s &apos; Deputation every day &apos; has worked out its result :
a Constitution . It was one of the rapidest Constitutions ever put
together ; made , some say in eight days , by Herault Sechelles and others :
probably a workmanlike , roadworthy Constitution enough ; -- on which point ,
however , we are , for some reasons , little called to form a judgment .
Workmanlike or not , the Forty @-@ four Thousand Communes of France ,
by overwhelming majorities , did hasten to accept it ; glad of any
Constitution whatsoever . Nay Departmental Deputies have come , the
venerablest Republicans of each Department , with solemn message of
Acceptance ; and now what remains but that our new Final Constitution be
proclaimed , and sworn to , in Feast of Pikes ? The Departmental Deputies ,
we say , are come some time ago ; -- Chaumette very anxious about them , lest
Girondin Monsieurs , Agio @-@ jobbers , or were it even Filles de joie of a
Girondin temper , corrupt their morals . ( Deux Amis , xi . 73 . ) Tenth of
August , immortal Anniversary , greater almost than Bastille July , is the
Day .

Painter David has not been idle . Thanks to David and the French genius ,
there steps forth into the sunlight , this day , a Scenic Phantasmagory
unexampled : -- whereof History , so occupied with Real @-@ Phantasmagories ,
will say but little .

For one thing , History can notice with satisfaction , on the ruins of
the Bastille , a Statue of Nature ; gigantic , spouting water from her two
mammelles . Not a Dream this ; but a Fact , palpable visible . There she
spouts , great Nature ; dim , before daybreak . But as the coming Sun
ruddies the East , come countless Multitudes , regulated and unregulated ;
come Departmental Deputies , come Mother Society and Daughters ; comes
National Convention , led on by handsome Herault ; soft wind @-@ music
breathing note of expectation . Lo , as great Sol scatters his first
fire @-@ handful , tipping the hills and chimney @-@ heads with gold , Herault is
at great Nature &apos;s feet ( she is Plaster of Paris merely ) ; Herault lifts ,
in an iron saucer , water spouted from the sacred breasts ; drinks of
it , with an eloquent Pagan Prayer , beginning , &quot; O Nature ! &quot; and all the
Departmental Deputies drink , each with what best suitable ejaculation or
prophetic @-@ utterance is in him ; -- amid breathings , which become blasts ,
of wind @-@ music ; and the roar of artillery and human throats : finishing
well the first act of this solemnity .

Next are processionings along the Boulevards : Deputies or Officials
bound together by long indivisible tricolor riband ; general &apos; members
of the Sovereign &apos; walking pellmell , with pikes , with hammers , with the
tools and emblems of their crafts ; among which we notice a Plough ,
and ancient Baucis and Philemon seated on it , drawn by their children .
Many @-@ voiced harmony and dissonance filling the air . Through Triumphal
Arches enough : at the basis of the first of which , we descry -- whom
thinkest thou ? -- the Heroines of the Insurrection of Women . Strong Dames
of the Market , they sit there ( Theroigne too ill to attend , one fears ) ,
with oak @-@ branches , tricolor bedizenment ; firm @-@ seated on their Cannons .
To whom handsome Herault , making pause of admiration , addresses soothing
eloquence ; whereupon they rise and fall into the march .

And now mark , in the Place de la Revolution , what other August Statue
may this be ; veiled in canvas , -- which swiftly we shear off by pulley and
cord ? The Statue of Liberty ! She too is of plaster , hoping to become of
metal ; stands where a Tyrant Louis Quinze once stood . &apos; Three thousand
birds &apos; are let loose , into the whole world , with labels round their
neck , We are free ; imitate us . Holocaust of Royalist and ci @-@ devant
trumpery , such as one could still gather , is burnt ; pontifical eloquence
must be uttered , by handsome Herault , and Pagan orisons offered up .

And then forward across the River ; where is new enormous Statuary ;
enormous plaster Mountain ; Hercules @-@ Peuple , with uplifted all @-@ conquering
club ; &apos; many @-@ headed Dragon of Girondin Federalism rising from fetid
marsh ; &apos; -- needing new eloquence from Herault . To say nothing of
Champ @-@ de @-@ Mars , and Fatherland &apos;s Altar there ; with urn of slain
Defenders , Carpenter &apos;s @-@ level of the Law ; and such exploding ,
gesticulating and perorating , that Herault &apos;s lips must be growing white ,
and his tongue cleaving to the roof of his mouth . ( Choix des Rapports ,
xii . 432 @-@ 42 . )

Towards six @-@ o &apos;clock let the wearied President , let Paris Patriotism
generally sit down to what repast , and social repasts , can be had ; and
with flowing tankard or light @-@ mantling glass , usher in this New and
Newest Era . In fact , is not Romme &apos;s New Calendar getting ready ? On all
housetops flicker little tricolor Flags , their flagstaff a Pike and
Liberty @-@ Cap . On all house @-@ walls , for no Patriot , not suspect , will
be behind another , there stand printed these words : Republic one and
indivisible , Liberty , Equality , Fraternity , or Death .

As to the New Calendar , we may say here rather than elsewhere that
speculative men have long been struck with the inequalities and
incongruities of the Old Calendar ; that a New one has long been as good
as determined on . Marechal the Atheist , almost ten years ago , proposed
a New Calendar , free at least from superstition : this the Paris
Municipality would now adopt , in defect of a better ; at all events , let
us have either this of Marechal &apos;s or a better , -- the New Era being come .
Petitions , more than once , have been sent to that effect ; and indeed ,
for a year past , all Public Bodies , Journalists , and Patriots in
general , have dated First Year of the Republic . It is a subject not
without difficulties . But the Convention has taken it up ; and Romme ,
as we say , has been meditating it ; not Marechal &apos;s New Calendar , but
a better New one of Romme &apos;s and our own . Romme , aided by a Monge , a
Lagrange and others , furnishes mathematics ; Fabre d &apos;Eglantine furnishes
poetic nomenclature : and so , on the 5th of October 1793 , after trouble
enough , they bring forth this New Republican Calendar of theirs , in a
complete state ; and by Law , get it put in action .

Four equal Seasons , Twelve equal Months of thirty days each : this makes
three hundred and sixty days ; and five odd days remain to be disposed
of . The five odd days we will make Festivals , and name the five
Sansculottides , or Days without Breeches . Festival of Genius ; Festival
of Labour ; of Actions ; of Rewards ; of Opinion : these are the five
Sansculottides . Whereby the great Circle , or Year , is made complete :
solely every fourth year , whilom called Leap @-@ year , we introduce a sixth
Sansculottide ; and name it Festival of the Revolution . Now as to the
day of commencement , which offers difficulties , is it not one of the
luckiest coincidences that the Republic herself commenced on the 21st of
September ; close on the Vernal Equinox ? Vernal Equinox , at midnight
for the meridian of Paris , in the year whilom Christian 1792 , from that
moment shall the New Era reckon itself to begin . Vendemiaire , Brumaire ,
Frimaire ; or as one might say , in mixed English , Vintagearious ,
Fogarious , Frostarious : these are our three Autumn months . Nivose ,
Pluviose , Ventose , or say Snowous , Rainous , Windous , make our Winter
season . Germinal , Floreal , Prairial , or Buddal , Floweral , Meadowal , are
our Spring season . Messidor , Thermidor , Fructidor , that is to say ( dor
being Greek for gift ) Reapidor , Heatidor , Fruitidor , are Republican
Summer . These Twelve , in a singular manner , divide the Republican
Year . Then as to minuter subdivisions , let us venture at once on a bold
stroke : adopt your decimal subdivision ; and instead of world @-@ old Week ,
or Se &apos;ennight , make it a Tennight or Decade ; -- not without results . There
are three Decades , then , in each of the months ; which is very regular ;
and the Decadi , or Tenth @-@ day , shall always be &apos; the Day of Rest . &apos; And the
Christian Sabbath , in that case ? Shall shift for itself !

This , in brief , in this New Calendar of Romme and the Convention ;
calculated for the meridian of Paris , and Gospel of Jean @-@ Jacques : not
one of the least afflicting occurrences for the actual British reader of
French History ; -- confusing the soul with Messidors , Meadowals ; till at
last , in self @-@ defence , one is forced to construct some ground @-@ scheme ,
or rule of Commutation from New @-@ style to Old @-@ style , and have it lying
by him . Such ground @-@ scheme , almost worn out in our service , but still
legible and printable , we shall now , in a Note , present to the reader .
For the Romme Calendar , in so many Newspapers , Memoirs , Public Acts , has
stamped itself deep into that section of Time : a New Era that lasts some
Twelve years and odd is not to be despised . Let the reader , therefore ,
with such ground @-@ scheme , help himself , where needful , out of New @-@ style
into Old @-@ style , called also &apos; slave @-@ style , stile @-@ esclave ; &apos; -- whereof we ,
in these pages , shall as much as possible use the latter only .

September 22nd of 1792 is Vendemiaire 1st of Year One , and the new
months are all of 30 days each ; therefore :


To the number of the We have the number of the
day in Add day in Days

There are 5 Sansculottides , and in leap @-@ year a sixth , to be added at the
end of Fructidor .

The New Calendar ceased on the 1st of January 1806 . ( See Choix des
Rapports , xiii . 83 @-@ 99 ; xix . 199 . )

Thus with new Feast of Pikes , and New Era or New Calendar , did France
accept her New Constitution : the most Democratic Constitution ever
committed to paper . How it will work in practice ? Patriot Deputations
from time to time solicit fruition of it ; that it be set a @-@ going .
Always , however , this seems questionable ; for the moment , unsuitable .
Till , in some weeks , Salut Public , through the organ of Saint @-@ Just ,
makes report , that , in the present alarming circumstances , the state of
France is Revolutionary ; that her &apos; Government must be Revolutionary till
the Peace ! &apos; Solely as Paper , then , and as a Hope , must this poor New
Constitution exist ; -- in which shape we may conceive it lying ; even now ,
with an infinity of other things , in that Limbo near the Moon . Further
than paper it never got , nor ever will get .



Chapter 3.4.V.

Sword of Sharpness .

In fact it is something quite other than paper theorems , it is iron and
audacity that France now needs .

Is not La Vendee still blazing ; -- alas too literally ; rogue Rossignol
burning the very corn @-@ mills ? General Santerre could do nothing there ;
General Rossignol , in blind fury , often in liquor , can do less than
nothing . Rebellion spreads , grows ever madder . Happily those lean
Quixote @-@ figures , whom we saw retreating out of Mentz , &apos; bound not to
serve against the Coalition for a year , &apos; have got to Paris . National
Convention packs them into post @-@ vehicles and conveyances ; sends them
swiftly , by post , into La Vendee ! There valiantly struggling , in obscure
battle and skirmish , under rogue Rossignol , let them , unlaurelled , save
the Republic , and &apos; be cut down gradually to the last man . &apos; ( Deux Amis ,
xi . 147 ; xiii . 160 @-@ 92 , &amp; c . )

Does not the Coalition , like a fire @-@ tide , pour in ; Prussia through the
opened North @-@ East ; Austria , England through the North @-@ West ? General
Houchard prospers no better there than General Custine did : let him look
to it ! Through the Eastern and the Western Pyrenees Spain has deployed
itself ; spreads , rustling with Bourbon banners , over the face of the
South . Ashes and embers of confused Girondin civil war covered that
region already . Marseilles is damped down , not quenched ; to be quenched
in blood . Toulon , terrorstruck , too far gone for turning , has flung
itself , ye righteous Powers , -- into the hands of the English ! On Toulon
Arsenal there flies a Flag , -- nay not even the Fleur @-@ de @-@ lys of a Louis
Pretender ; there flies that accursed St. George &apos;s Cross of the English
and Admiral Hood ! What remnants of sea @-@ craft , arsenals , roperies ,
war @-@ navy France had , has given itself to these enemies of human nature ,
&apos;ennemis du genre humain . &apos; Beleaguer it , bombard it , ye Commissioners
Barras , Freron , Robespierre Junior ; thou General Cartaux , General
Dugommier ; above all , thou remarkable Artillery @-@ Major , Napoleon
Buonaparte ! Hood is fortifying himself , victualling himself ; means ,
apparently , to make a new Gibraltar of it .

But lo , in the Autumn night , late night , among the last of August , what
sudden red sunblaze is this that has risen over Lyons City ; with a noise
to deafen the world ? It is the Powder @-@ tower of Lyons , nay the Arsenal
with four Powder @-@ towers , which has caught fire in the Bombardment ; and
sprung into the air , carrying &apos; a hundred and seventeen houses &apos; after it .
With a light , one fancies , as of the noon sun ; with a roar second only
to the Last Trumpet ! All living sleepers far and wide it has awakened .
What a sight was that , which the eye of History saw , in the sudden
nocturnal sunblaze ! The roofs of hapless Lyons , and all its domes
and steeples made momentarily clear ; Rhone and Saone streams flashing
suddenly visible ; and height and hollow , hamlet and smooth
stubblefield , and all the region round ; -- heights , alas , all scarped and
counterscarped , into trenches , curtains , redouts ; blue Artillery @-@ men ,
little Powder @-@ devilkins , plying their hell @-@ trade there , through the not
ambrosial night ! Let the darkness cover it again ; for it pains the
eye . Of a truth , Chalier &apos;s death is costing this City dear . Convention
Commissioners , Lyons Congresses have come and gone ; and action there
was and reaction ; bad ever growing worse ; till it has come to this :
Commissioner Dubois @-@ Crance , &apos; with seventy thousand men , and all the
Artillery of several Provinces , &apos; bombarding Lyons day and night .

Worse things still are in store . Famine is in Lyons , and ruin , and fire .
Desperate are the sallies of the besieged ; brave Precy , their National
Colonel and Commandant , doing what is in man : desperate but ineffectual .
Provisions cut off ; nothing entering our city but shot and shells ! The
Arsenal has roared aloft ; the very Hospital will be battered down , and
the sick buried alive . A Black Flag hung on this latter noble Edifice ,
appealing to the pity of the beseigers ; for though maddened , were they
not still our brethren ? In their blind wrath , they took it for a flag
of defiance , and aimed thitherward the more . Bad is growing ever worse
here : and how will the worse stop , till it have grown worst of all ?
Commissioner Dubois will listen to no pleading , to no speech , save
this only , &apos; We surrender at discretion . &apos; Lyons contains in it subdued
Jacobins ; dominant Girondins ; secret Royalists . And now , mere deaf
madness and cannon @-@ shot enveloping them , will not the desperate
Municipality fly , at last , into the arms of Royalism itself ? Majesty of
Sardinia was to bring help , but it failed . Emigrant Autichamp , in name
of the Two Pretender Royal Highnesses , is coming through Switzerland
with help ; coming , not yet come : Precy hoists the Fleur @-@ de @-@ lys !

At sight of which , all true Girondins sorrowfully fling down their
arms : -- Let our Tricolor brethren storm us , then , and slay us in their
wrath : with you we conquer not . The famishing women and children
are sent forth : deaf Dubois sends them back ; -- rains in mere fire and
madness . Our &apos; redouts of cotton @-@ bags &apos; are taken , retaken ; Precy under
his Fleur @-@ de @-@ lys is valiant as Despair . What will become of Lyons ? It is
a siege of seventy days . ( Deux Amis , xi . 80 @-@ 143 . )

Or see , in these same weeks , far in the Western waters : breasting
through the Bay of Biscay , a greasy dingy little Merchantship , with
Scotch skipper ; under hatches whereof sit , disconsolate , -- the last
forlorn nucleus of Girondism , the Deputies from Quimper ! Several have
dissipated themselves , whithersoever they could . Poor Riouffe fell into
the talons of Revolutionary Committee , and Paris Prison . The rest sit
here under hatches ; reverend Petion with his grey hair , angry Buzot ,
suspicious Louvet , brave young Barbaroux , and others . They have escaped
from Quimper , in this sad craft ; are now tacking and struggling ; in
danger from the waves , in danger from the English , in still worse danger
from the French ; -- banished by Heaven and Earth to the greasy belly of
this Scotch skipper &apos;s Merchant @-@ vessel , unfruitful Atlantic raving round .
They are for Bourdeaux , if peradventure hope yet linger there . Enter
not Bourdeaux , O Friends ! Bloody Convention Representatives , Tallien and
such like , with their Edicts , with their Guillotine , have arrived there ;
Respectability is driven under ground ; Jacobinism lords it on high .
From that Reole landingplace , or Beak of Ambes , as it were , Pale Death ,
waving his Revolutionary Sword of sharpness , waves you elsewhither !

On one side or the other of that Bec d &apos;Ambes , the Scotch Skipper with
difficulty moors , a dexterous greasy man ; with difficulty lands his
Girondins ; -- who , after reconnoitring , must rapidly burrow in the Earth ;
and so , in subterranean ways , in friends &apos; back @-@ closets , in cellars ,
barn @-@ lofts , in Caves of Saint @-@ Emilion and Libourne , stave off cruel
Death . ( Louvet , p . 180 @-@ 199 . ) Unhappiest of all Senators !



Chapter 3.4.VI.

Risen against Tyrants .

Against all which incalculable impediments , horrors and disasters , what
can a Jacobin Convention oppose ? The uncalculating Spirit of Jacobinism ,
and Sansculottic sans @-@ formulistic Frenzy ! Our Enemies press in on us ,
says Danton , but they shall not conquer us , &quot; we will burn France to
ashes rather , nous brulerons la France . &quot;

Committees , of Surete or Salut , have raised themselves &apos; a la hauteur ,
to the height of circumstances . &apos; Let all mortals raise themselves a la
hauteur . Let the Forty @-@ four thousand Sections and their Revolutionary
Committees stir every fibre of the Republic ; and every Frenchman feel
that he is to do or die . They are the life @-@ circulation of Jacobinism ,
these Sections and Committees : Danton , through the organ of Barrere and
Salut Public , gets decreed , That there be in Paris , by law , two meetings
of Section weekly ; also , that the Poorer Citizen be paid for attending ,
and have his day &apos;s @-@ wages of Forty Sous . ( Moniteur , Seance du 5
Septembre , 1793 . ) This is the celebrated &apos; Law of the Forty Sous ; &apos;
fiercely stimulant to Sansculottism , to the life @-@ circulation of
Jacobinism .

On the twenty @-@ third of August , Committee of Public Salvation , as usual
through Barrere , had promulgated , in words not unworthy of remembering ,
their Report , which is soon made into a Law , of Levy in Mass . &apos; All
France , and whatsoever it contains of men or resources , is put under
requisition , &apos; says Barrere ; really in Tyrtaean words , the best we know
of his . &apos; The Republic is one vast besieged city . &apos; Two hundred and fifty
Forges shall , in these days , be set up in the Luxembourg Garden , and
round the outer wall of the Tuileries ; to make gun @-@ barrels ; in sight
of Earth and Heaven ! From all hamlets , towards their Departmental Town ;
from all their Departmental Towns , towards the appointed Camp and seat
of war , the Sons of Freedom shall march ; their banner is to bear : &apos; Le
Peuple Francais debout contres les Tyrans , The French People risen
against Tyrants . &apos; &apos; The young men shall go to the battle ; it is their
task to conquer : the married men shall forge arms , transport baggage
and artillery ; provide subsistence : the women shall work at soldiers&apos;
clothes , make tents ; serve in the hospitals . The children shall scrape
old @-@ linen into surgeon &apos;s @-@ lint : the aged men shall have themselves
carried into public places ; and there , by their words , excite the
courage of the young ; preach hatred to Kings and unity to the Republic . &apos; 
( Debats , Seance du 23 Aout 1793 . ) Tyrtaean words , which tingle through
all French hearts .

In this humour , then , since no other serves , will France rush against
its enemies . Headlong , reckoning no cost or consequence ; heeding no law
or rule but that supreme law , Salvation of the People ! The weapons are
all the iron that is in France ; the strength is that of all the men ,
women and children that are in France . There , in their two hundred and
fifty shed @-@ smithies , in Garden of Luxembourg or Tuileries , let them
forge gun @-@ barrels , in sight of Heaven and Earth .

Nor with heroic daring against the Foreign foe , can black vengeance
against the Domestic be wanting . Life @-@ circulation of the Revolutionary
Committees being quickened by that Law of the Forty Sous , Deputy Merlin ,
not the Thionviller , whom we saw ride out of Mentz , but Merlin of Douai ,
named subsequently Merlin Suspect , -- comes , about a week after , with
his world @-@ famous Law of the Suspect : ordering all Sections , by their
Committees , instantly to arrest all Persons Suspect ; and explaining
withal who the Arrestable and Suspect specially are . &quot; Are Suspect , &quot; says
he , &quot; all who by their actions , by their connexions , speakings , writings
have &quot; -- in short become Suspect . ( Moniteur , Seance du 17 Septembre 1793 . )
Nay Chaumette , illuminating the matter still further , in his Municipal
Placards and Proclamations , will bring it about that you may almost
recognise a Suspect on the streets , and clutch him there , -- off to
Committee , and Prison . Watch well your words , watch well your looks : if
Suspect of nothing else , you may grow , as came to be a saying , &apos; Suspect
of being Suspect ! &apos; For are we not in a State of Revolution ?

No frightfuller Law ever ruled in a Nation of men . All Prisons and
Houses of Arrest in French land are getting crowded to the ridge @-@ tile :
Forty @-@ four thousand Committees , like as many companies of reapers or
gleaners , gleaning France , are gathering their harvest , and storing it
in these Houses . Harvest of Aristocrat tares ! Nay , lest the Forty @-@ four
thousand , each on its own harvest @-@ field , prove insufficient , we are to
have an ambulant &apos; Revolutionary Army : &apos; six thousand strong , under right
captains , this shall perambulate the country at large , and strike in
wherever it finds such harvest @-@ work slack . So have Municipality and
Mother Society petitioned ; so has Convention decreed . ( Ibid . Seances du
5 , 9 , 11 Septembre . ) Let Aristocrats , Federalists , Monsieurs vanish ,
and all men tremble : &apos; The Soil of Liberty shall be purged , &apos; -- with a
vengeance !

Neither hitherto has the Revolutionary Tribunal been keeping holyday .
Blanchelande , for losing Saint @-@ Domingo ; &apos; Conspirators of Orleans , &apos; for
&apos;assassinating , &apos; for assaulting the sacred Deputy Leonard @-@ Bourdon : these
with many Nameless , to whom life was sweet , have died . Daily the great
Guillotine has its due . Like a black Spectre , daily at eventide ,
glides the Death @-@ tumbril through the variegated throng of things . The
variegated street shudders at it , for the moment ; next moment forgets
it : The Aristocrats ! They were guilty against the Republic ; their death ,
were it only that their goods are confiscated , will be useful to the
Republic ; Vive la Republique !

In the last days of August , fell a notabler head : General Custine &apos;s .
Custine was accused of harshness , of unskilfulness , perfidiousness ;
accused of many things : found guilty , we may say , of one thing ,
unsuccessfulness . Hearing his unexpected Sentence , &apos; Custine fell down
before the Crucifix , &apos; silent for the space of two hours : he fared , with
moist eyes and a book of prayer , towards the Place de la Revolution ;
glanced upwards at the clear suspended axe ; then mounted swiftly aloft ,
( Deux Amis , xi . 148 @-@ 188 . ) swiftly was struck away from the lists of the
Living . He had fought in America ; he was a proud , brave man ; and his
fortune led him hither .

On the 2nd of this same month , at three in the morning , a vehicle rolled
off , with closed blinds , from the Temple to the Conciergerie . Within it
were two Municipals ; and Marie @-@ Antoinette , once Queen of France ! There
in that Conciergerie , in ignominious dreary cell , she , cut off from
children , kindred , friend and hope , sits long weeks ; expecting when the
end will be . ( See Memoires particuliers de la Captivite a la Tour du
Temple , by the Duchesse d &apos;Angouleme , Paris , 21 Janvier 1817 . )

The Guillotine , we find , gets always a quicker motion , as other things
are quickening . The Guillotine , by its speed of going , will give index
of the general velocity of the Republic . The clanking of its huge axe ,
rising and falling there , in horrid systole @-@ diastole , is portion of
the whole enormous Life @-@ movement and pulsation of the Sansculottic
System ! -- &apos; Orleans Conspirators &apos; and Assaulters had to die , in spite of
much weeping and entreating ; so sacred is the person of a Deputy . Yet
the sacred can become desecrated : your very Deputy is not greater
than the Guillotine . Poor Deputy Journalist Gorsas : we saw him hide at
Rennes , when the Calvados War burnt priming . He stole afterwards , in
August , to Paris ; lurked several weeks about the Palais ci @-@ devant Royal ;
was seen there , one day ; was clutched , identified , and without ceremony ,
being already &apos; out of the Law , &apos; was sent to the Place de la Revolution .
He died , recommending his wife and children to the pity of the Republic .
It is the ninth day of October 1793 . Gorsas is the first Deputy that
dies on the scaffold ; he will not be the last .

Ex @-@ Mayor Bailly is in prison ; Ex @-@ Procureur Manuel . Brissot and our
poor Arrested Girondins have become Incarcerated Indicted Girondins ;
universal Jacobinism clamouring for their punishment . Duperret &apos;s Seals
are broken ! Those Seventy @-@ three Secret Protesters , suddenly one day ,
are reported upon , are decreed accused ; the Convention @-@ doors being
&apos;previously shut , &apos; that none implicated might escape . They were marched ,
in a very rough manner , to Prison that evening . Happy those of them who
chanced to be absent ! Condorcet has vanished into darkness ; perhaps ,
like Rabaut , sits between two walls , in the house of a friend .



Chapter 3.4.VII.

Marie @-@ Antoinette .

On Monday the Fourteenth of October , 1793 , a Cause is pending in the
Palais de Justice , in the new Revolutionary Court , such as these old
stone @-@ walls never witnessed : the Trial of Marie @-@ Antoinette . The once
brightest of Queens , now tarnished , defaced , forsaken , stands here at
Fouquier Tinville &apos;s Judgment @-@ bar ; answering for her life ! The Indictment
was delivered her last night . ( Proces de la Reine , Deux Amis , xi .
251 @-@ 381 . ) To such changes of human fortune what words are adequate ?
Silence alone is adequate .

There are few Printed things one meets with , of such tragic almost
ghastly significance as those bald Pages of the Bulletin du Tribunal
Revolutionnaire , which bear title , Trial of the Widow Capet . Dim , dim ,
as if in disastrous eclipse ; like the pale kingdoms of Dis ! Plutonic
Judges , Plutonic Tinville ; encircled , nine times , with Styx and
Lethe , with Fire @-@ Phlegethon and Cocytus named of Lamentation ! The very
witnesses summoned are like Ghosts : exculpatory , inculpatory , they
themselves are all hovering over death and doom ; they are known , in
our imagination , as the prey of the Guillotine . Tall ci @-@ devant Count
d &apos;Estaing , anxious to shew himself Patriot , cannot escape ; nor Bailly ,
who , when asked If he knows the Accused , answers with a reverent
inclination towards her , &quot; Ah , yes , I know Madame . &quot; Ex @-@ Patriots are here ,
sharply dealt with , as Procureur Manuel ; Ex @-@ Ministers , shorn of their
splendour . We have cold Aristocratic impassivity , faithful to itself
even in Tartarus ; rabid stupidity , of Patriot Corporals , Patriot
Washerwomen , who have much to say of Plots , Treasons , August Tenth , old
Insurrection of Women . For all now has become a crime , in her who has
lost .

Marie @-@ Antoinette , in this her utter abandonment and hour of extreme
need , is not wanting to herself , the imperial woman . Her look , they
say , as that hideous Indictment was reading , continued calm ; &apos; she was
sometimes observed moving her fingers , as when one plays on the Piano . &apos; 
You discern , not without interest , across that dim Revolutionary
Bulletin itself , how she bears herself queenlike . Her answers are
prompt , clear , often of Laconic brevity ; resolution , which has grown
contemptuous without ceasing to be dignified , veils itself in calm
words . &quot; You persist then in denial ? &quot; -- &quot; My plan is not denial : it is the
truth I have said , and I persist in that . &quot; Scandalous Hebert has
borne his testimony as to many things : as to one thing , concerning
Marie @-@ Antoinette and her little Son , -- wherewith Human Speech had better
not further be soiled . She has answered Hebert ; a Juryman begs to
observe that she has not answered as to this . &quot; I have not answered , &quot; she
exclaims with noble emotion , &quot; because Nature refuses to answer such a
charge brought against a Mother . I appeal to all the Mothers that are
here . &quot; Robespierre , when he heard of it , broke out into something almost
like swearing at the brutish blockheadism of this Hebert ; ( Vilate ,
Causes secretes de la Revolution de Thermidor ( Paris , 1825 ) , p . 179 . ) on
whose foul head his foul lie has recoiled . At four o &apos;clock on Wednesday
morning , after two days and two nights of interrogating , jury @-@ charging ,
and other darkening of counsel , the result comes out : Sentence of Death .
&quot; Have you anything to say ? &quot; The Accused shook her head , without speech .
Night &apos;s candles are burning out ; and with her too Time is finishing ,
and it will be Eternity and Day . This Hall of Tinville &apos;s is dark ,
ill @-@ lighted except where she stands . Silently she withdraws from it , to
die .

Two Processions , or Royal Progresses , three @-@ and @-@ twenty years apart , have
often struck us with a strange feeling of contrast . The first is of a
beautiful Archduchess and Dauphiness , quitting her Mother &apos;s City , at the
age of Fifteen ; towards hopes such as no other Daughter of Eve then had :
&apos;On the morrow , &apos; says Weber an eye witness , &apos; the Dauphiness left Vienna .
The whole City crowded out ; at first with a sorrow which was silent . She
appeared : you saw her sunk back into her carriage ; her face bathed in
tears ; hiding her eyes now with her handkerchief , now with her hands ;
several times putting out her head to see yet again this Palace of her
Fathers , whither she was to return no more . She motioned her regret ,
her gratitude to the good Nation , which was crowding here to bid her
farewell . Then arose not only tears ; but piercing cries , on all sides .
Men and women alike abandoned themselves to such expression of their
sorrow . It was an audible sound of wail , in the streets and avenues of
Vienna . The last Courier that followed her disappeared , and the crowd
melted away . &apos; ( Weber , i . 6 . )

The young imperial Maiden of Fifteen has now become a worn discrowned
Widow of Thirty @-@ eight ; grey before her time : this is the last
Procession : &apos; Few minutes after the Trial ended , the drums were beating
to arms in all Sections ; at sunrise the armed force was on foot , cannons
getting placed at the extremities of the Bridges , in the Squares ,
Crossways , all along from the Palais de Justice to the Place de la
Revolution . By ten o &apos;clock , numerous patrols were circulating in the
Streets ; thirty thousand foot and horse drawn up under arms . At eleven ,
Marie @-@ Antoinette was brought out . She had on an undress of pique blanc :
she was led to the place of execution , in the same manner as an ordinary
criminal ; bound , on a Cart ; accompanied by a Constitutional Priest in
Lay dress ; escorted by numerous detachments of infantry and cavalry .
These , and the double row of troops all along her road , she appeared to
regard with indifference . On her countenance there was visible neither
abashment nor pride . To the cries of Vive la Republique and Down with
Tyranny , which attended her all the way , she seemed to pay no heed . She
spoke little to her Confessor . The tricolor Streamers on the housetops
occupied her attention , in the Streets du Roule and Saint @-@ Honore ; she
also noticed the Inscriptions on the house @-@ fronts . On reaching the Place
de la Revolution , her looks turned towards the Jardin National , whilom
Tuileries ; her face at that moment gave signs of lively emotion . She
mounted the Scaffold with courage enough ; at a quarter past Twelve ,
her head fell ; the Executioner shewed it to the people , amid universal
long @-@ continued cries of &apos; Vive la Republique . &apos; ( Deux Amis , xi . 301 . )



Chapter 3.4.VIII.

The Twenty @-@ two .


Whom next , O Tinville ? The next are of a different colour : our poor
Arrested Girondin Deputies . What of them could still be laid hold of ;
our Vergniaud , Brissot , Fauchet , Valaze , Gensonne ; the once flower of
French Patriotism , Twenty @-@ two by the tale : hither , at Tinville &apos;s Bar ,
onward from &apos; safeguard of the French People , &apos; from confinement in the
Luxembourg , imprisonment in the Conciergerie , have they now , by the
course of things , arrived . Fouquier Tinville must give what account of
them he can .

Undoubtedly this Trial of the Girondins is the greatest that Fouquier
has yet had to do . Twenty @-@ two , all chief Republicans , ranged in a line
there ; the most eloquent in France ; Lawyers too ; not without friends
in the auditory . How will Tinville prove these men guilty of Royalism ,
Federalism , Conspiracy against the Republic ? Vergniaud &apos;s eloquence
awakes once more ; &apos; draws tears , &apos; they say . And Journalists report ,
and the Trial lengthens itself out day after day ; &apos; threatens to become
eternal , &apos; murmur many . Jacobinism and Municipality rise to the aid of
Fouquier . On the 28th of the month , Hebert and others come in deputation
to inform a Patriot Convention that the Revolutionary Tribunal is quite
&apos;shackled by forms of Law ; &apos; that a Patriot Jury ought to have &apos; the power
of cutting short , of terminer les debats , when they feel themselves
convinced . &apos; Which pregnant suggestion , of cutting short , passes itself ,
with all despatch , into a Decree .

Accordingly , at ten o &apos;clock on the night of the 30th of October , the
Twenty @-@ two , summoned back once more , receive this information , That the
Jury feeling themselves convinced have cut short , have brought in their
verdict ; that the Accused are found guilty , and the Sentence on one and
all of them is Death with confiscation of goods .

Loud natural clamour rises among the poor Girondins ; tumult ; which can
only be repressed by the gendarmes . Valaze stabs himself ; falls down
dead on the spot . The rest , amid loud clamour and confusion , are driven
back to their Conciergerie ; Lasource exclaiming , &quot; I die on the day when
the People have lost their reason ; ye will die when they recover it . &quot;
( Greek , -- Plut . Opp. t. iv. p . 310. ed . Reiske , 1776 . ) No help ! Yielding
to violence , the Doomed uplift the Hymn of the Marseillese ; return
singing to their dungeon .

Riouffe , who was their Prison @-@ mate in these last days , has lovingly
recorded what death they made . To our notions , it is not an edifying
death . Gay satirical Pot @-@ pourri by Ducos ; rhymed Scenes of Tragedy ,
wherein Barrere and Robespierre discourse with Satan ; death &apos;s eve spent
in &apos; singing &apos; and &apos; sallies of gaiety , &apos; with &apos; discourses on the happiness
of peoples : &apos; these things , and the like of these , we have to accept for
what they are worth . It is the manner in which the Girondins make their
Last Supper . Valaze , with bloody breast , sleeps cold in death ; hears not
their singing . Vergniaud has his dose of poison ; but it is not enough
for his friends , it is enough only for himself ; wherefore he flings
it from him ; presides at this Last Supper of the Girondins , with
wild coruscations of eloquence , with song and mirth . Poor human Will
struggles to assert itself ; if not in this way , then in that . ( Memoires
de Riouffe in Memoires sur les Prisons , Paris , 1823 , p . 48 @-@ 55 . )

But on the morrow morning all Paris is out ; such a crowd as no man had
seen . The Death @-@ carts , Valaze &apos;s cold corpse stretched among the yet
living Twenty @-@ one , roll along . Bareheaded , hands bound ; in their
shirt @-@ sleeves , coat flung loosely round the neck : so fare the eloquent
of France ; bemurmured , beshouted . To the shouts of Vive la Republique ,
some of them keep answering with counter @-@ shouts of Vive la Republique .
Others , as Brissot , sit sunk in silence . At the foot of the scaffold
they again strike up , with appropriate variations , the Hymn of the
Marseillese . Such an act of music ; conceive it well ! The yet Living
chant there ; the chorus so rapidly wearing weak ! Samson &apos;s axe is rapid ;
one head per minute , or little less . The chorus is worn out ; farewell
for evermore ye Girondins . Te @-@ Deum Fauchet has become silent ; Valaze &apos;s
dead head is lopped : the sickle of the Guillotine has reaped the
Girondins all away . &apos; The eloquent , the young , the beautiful and brave ! &apos;
exclaims Riouffe . O Death , what feast is toward in thy ghastly Halls ?

Nor alas , in the far Bourdeaux region , will Girondism fare better . In
caves of Saint @-@ Emilion , in loft and cellar , the weariest months , roll
on ; apparel worn , purse empty ; wintry November come ; under Tallien
and his Guillotine , all hope now gone . Danger drawing ever nigher ,
difficulty pressing ever straiter , they determine to separate . Not
unpathetic the farewell ; tall Barbaroux , cheeriest of brave men , stoops
to clasp his Louvet : &quot; In what place soever thou findest my mother , &quot;
cries he , &quot; try to be instead of a son to her : no resource of mine but
I will share with thy Wife , should chance ever lead me where she is . &quot;
( Louvet , p . 213 . )

Louvet went with Guadet , with Salles and Valady ; Barbaroux with Buzot
and Petion . Valady soon went southward , on a way of his own . The two
friends and Louvet had a miserable day and night ; the 14th of November
month , 1793 . Sunk in wet , weariness and hunger , they knock , on the
morrow , for help , at a friend &apos;s country @-@ house ; the fainthearted friend
refuses to admit them . They stood therefore under trees , in the pouring
rain . Flying desperate , Louvet thereupon will to Paris . He sets forth ,
there and then , splashing the mud on each side of him , with a fresh
strength gathered from fury or frenzy . He passes villages , finding &apos; the
sentry asleep in his box in the thick rain ; &apos; he is gone , before the
man can call after him . He bilks Revolutionary Committees ; rides in
carriers &apos; carts , covered carts and open ; lies hidden in one , under
knapsacks and cloaks of soldiers &apos; wives on the Street of Orleans ,
while men search for him : has hairbreadth escapes that would fill
three romances : finally he gets to Paris to his fair Helpmate ; gets to
Switzerland , and waits better days .

Poor Guadet and Salles were both taken , ere long ; they died by the
Guillotine in Bourdeaux ; drums beating to drown their voice . Valady also
is caught , and guillotined . Barbaroux and his two comrades weathered it
longer , into the summer of 1794 ; but not long enough . One July morning ,
changing their hiding place , as they have often to do , &apos; about a league
from Saint @-@ Emilion , they observe a great crowd of country @-@ people ; &apos;
doubtless Jacobins come to take them ? Barbaroux draws a pistol , shoots
himself dead . Alas , and it was not Jacobins ; it was harmless villagers
going to a village wake . Two days afterwards , Buzot and Petion were
found in a Cornfield , their bodies half @-@ eaten with dogs . ( Recherches
Historiques sur les Girondins in Memoires de Buzot , p . 107 . )

Such was the end of Girondism . They arose to regenerate France , these
men ; and have accomplished this . Alas , whatever quarrel we had with
them , has not their cruel fate abolished it ? Pity only survives . So many
excellent souls of heroes sent down to Hades ; they themselves given as
a prey of dogs and all manner of birds ! But , here too , the will of the
Supreme Power was accomplished . As Vergniaud said : &apos; The Revolution , like
Saturn , is devouring its own children . &apos;

TERROR THE ORDER OF THE DAY


Chapter 3.5.I.

Rushing down .

We are now , therefore , got to that black precipitous Abyss ; whither all
things have long been tending ; where , having now arrived on the giddy
verge , they hurl down , in confused ruin ; headlong , pellmell , down ,
down ; -- till Sansculottism have consummated itself ; and in this wondrous
French Revolution , as in a Doomsday , a World have been rapidly , if not
born again , yet destroyed and engulphed . Terror has long been terrible :
but to the actors themselves it has now become manifest that their
appointed course is one of Terror ; and they say , Be it so . &quot; Que la
Terreur soit a l &apos;ordre du jour . &quot;

So many centuries , say only from Hugh Capet downwards , had been adding
together , century transmitting it with increase to century , the sum of
Wickedness , of Falsehood , Oppression of man by man . Kings were
sinners , and Priests were , and People . Open @-@ Scoundrels rode triumphant ,
bediademed , becoronetted , bemitred ; or the still fataller species
of Secret @-@ Scoundrels , in their fair @-@ sounding formulas , speciosities ,
respectabilities , hollow within : the race of Quacks was grown many
as the sands of the sea . Till at length such a sum of Quackery had
accumulated itself as , in brief , the Earth and the Heavens were weary
of . Slow seemed the Day of Settlement : coming on , all imperceptible ,
across the bluster and fanfaronade of Courtierisms , Conquering @-@ Heroisms ,
Most @-@ Christian Grand Monarque @-@ isms . Well @-@ beloved Pompadourisms : yet
behold it was always coming ; behold it has come , suddenly , unlooked for
by any man ! The harvest of long centuries was ripening and whitening so
rapidly of late ; and now it is grown white , and is reaped rapidly , as it
were , in one day . Reaped , in this Reign of Terror ; and carried home , to
Hades and the Pit ! -- Unhappy Sons of Adam : it is ever so ; and never
do they know it , nor will they know it . With cheerfully smoothed
countenances , day after day , and generation after generation , they ,
calling cheerfully to one another , &quot; Well @-@ speed @-@ ye , &quot; are at work , sowing
the wind . And yet , as God lives , they shall reap the whirlwind : no other
thing , we say , is possible , -- since God is a Truth and His World is a
Truth .

History , however , in dealing with this Reign of Terror , has had her own
difficulties . While the Phenomenon continued in its primary state , as
mere &apos; Horrors of the French Revolution , &apos; there was abundance to be said
and shrieked . With and also without profit . Heaven knows there were
terrors and horrors enough : yet that was not all the Phenomenon ; nay ,
more properly , that was not the Phenomenon at all , but rather was the
shadow of it , the negative part of it . And now , in a new stage of the
business , when History , ceasing to shriek , would try rather to include
under her old Forms of speech or speculation this new amazing Thing ;
that so some accredited scientific Law of Nature might suffice for
the unexpected Product of Nature , and History might get to speak of it
articulately , and draw inferences and profit from it ; in this new
stage , History , we must say , babbles and flounders perhaps in a still
painfuller manner . Take , for example , the latest Form of speech we
have seen propounded on the subject as adequate to it , almost in these
months , by our worthy M. Roux , in his Histoire Parlementaire . The latest
and the strangest : that the French Revolution was a dead @-@ lift effort ,
after eighteen hundred years of preparation , to realise -- the Christian
Religion ! ( Hist . Parl . Introd . , i . 1 et seqq . ) Unity , Indivisibility ,
Brotherhood or Death did indeed stand printed on all Houses of the
Living ; also , on Cemeteries , or Houses of the Dead , stood printed , by
order of Procureur Chaumette , Here is eternal Sleep : ( Deux Amis ,
xii . 78 . ) but a Christian Religion realised by the Guillotine and
Death @-@ Eternal , &apos; is suspect to me , &apos; as Robespierre was wont to say ,
&apos;m &apos;est suspecte . &apos; 

Alas , no , M. Roux ! A Gospel of Brotherhood , not according to any of the
Four old Evangelists , and calling on men to repent , and amend each his
own wicked existence , that they might be saved ; but a Gospel rather , as
we often hint , according to a new Fifth Evangelist Jean @-@ Jacques , calling
on men to amend each the whole world &apos;s wicked existence , and be saved
by making the Constitution . A thing different and distant toto coelo , as
they say : the whole breadth of the sky , and further if possible ! -- It is
thus , however , that History , and indeed all human Speech and Reason does
yet , what Father Adam began life by doing : strive to name the new Things
it sees of Nature &apos;s producing , -- often helplessly enough .

But what if History were to admit , for once , that all the Names and
Theorems yet known to her fall short ? That this grand Product of Nature
was even grand , and new , in that it came not to range itself under old
recorded Laws @-@ of @-@ Nature at all ; but to disclose new ones ? In that case ,
History renouncing the pretention to name it at present , will look
honestly at it , and name what she can of it ! Any approximation to the
right Name has value : were the right name itself once here , the Thing is
known thenceforth ; the Thing is then ours , and can be dealt with .

Now surely not realization , of Christianity , or of aught earthly , do we
discern in this Reign of Terror , in this French Revolution of which
it is the consummating . Destruction rather we discern -- of all that was
destructible . It is as if Twenty @-@ five millions , risen at length into
the Pythian mood , had stood up simultaneously to say , with a sound which
goes through far lands and times , that this Untruth of an Existence had
become insupportable . O ye Hypocrisies and Speciosities , Royal
mantles , Cardinal plushcloaks , ye Credos , Formulas , Respectabilities ,
fair @-@ painted Sepulchres full of dead men &apos;s bones , -- behold , ye appear to
us to be altogether a Lie . Yet our Life is not a Lie ; yet our Hunger
and Misery is not a Lie ! Behold we lift up , one and all , our Twenty @-@ five
million right @-@ hands ; and take the Heavens , and the Earth and also the
Pit of Tophet to witness , that either ye shall be abolished , or else we
shall be abolished !

No inconsiderable Oath , truly ; forming , as has been often said , the most
remarkable transaction in these last thousand years . Wherefrom likewise
there follow , and will follow , results . The fulfilment of this Oath ;
that is to say , the black desperate battle of Men against their whole
Condition and Environment , -- a battle , alas , withal , against the Sin
and Darkness that was in themselves as in others : this is the Reign
of Terror . Transcendental despair was the purport of it , though not
consciously so . False hopes , of Fraternity , Political Millennium , and
what not , we have always seen : but the unseen heart of the whole , the
transcendental despair , was not false ; neither has it been of no effect .
Despair , pushed far enough , completes the circle , so to speak ; and
becomes a kind of genuine productive hope again .

Doctrine of Fraternity , out of old Catholicism , does , it is true , very
strangely in the vehicle of a Jean @-@ Jacques Evangel , suddenly plump down
out of its cloud @-@ firmament ; and from a theorem determine to make itself
a practice . But just so do all creeds , intentions , customs , knowledges ,
thoughts and things , which the French have , suddenly plump down ;
Catholicism , Classicism , Sentimentalism , Cannibalism : all isms that make
up Man in France , are rushing and roaring in that gulf ; and the theorem
has become a practice , and whatsoever cannot swim sinks . Not Evangelist
Jean @-@ Jacques alone ; there is not a Village Schoolmaster but has
contributed his quota : do we not &apos; thou &apos; one another , according to the
Free Peoples of Antiquity ? The French Patriot , in red phrygian nightcap
of Liberty , christens his poor little red infant Cato , -- Censor , or
else of Utica . Gracchus has become Baboeuf and edits Newspapers ;
Mutius Scaevola , Cordwainer of that ilk , presides in the Section
Mutius @-@ Scaevola : and in brief , there is a world wholly jumbling itself ,
to try what will swim !

Wherefore we will , at all events , call this Reign of Terror a very
strange one . Dominant Sansculottism makes , as it were , free arena ; one
of the strangest temporary states Humanity was ever seen in . A nation of
men , full of wants and void of habits ! The old habits are gone to wreck
because they were old : men , driven forward by Necessity and fierce
Pythian Madness , have , on the spur of the instant , to devise for the
want the way of satisfying it . The wonted tumbles down ; by imitation ,
by invention , the Unwonted hastily builds itself up . What the French
National head has in it comes out : if not a great result , surely one of
the strangest .

Neither shall the reader fancy that it was all blank , this Reign of
Terror : far from it . How many hammermen and squaremen , bakers and
brewers , washers and wringers , over this France , must ply their old
daily work , let the Government be one of Terror or one of Joy ! In this
Paris there are Twenty @-@ three Theatres nightly ; some count as many
as Sixty Places of Dancing . ( Mercier. ii . 124 . ) The Playwright
manufactures : pieces of a strictly Republican character . Ever fresh
Novelgarbage , as of old , fodders the Circulating Libraries . ( Moniteur of
these months , passim . ) The &apos; Cesspool of Agio , &apos; now in the time of Paper
Money , works with a vivacity unexampled , unimagined ; exhales from itself
&apos;sudden fortunes , &apos; like Alladin @-@ Palaces : really a kind of miraculous
Fata @-@ Morganas , since you can live in them , for a time . Terror is as a
sable ground , on which the most variegated of scenes paints itself .
In startling transitions , in colours all intensated , the sublime , the
ludicrous , the horrible succeed one another ; or rather , in crowding
tumult , accompany one another .

Here , accordingly , if anywhere , the &apos; hundred tongues , &apos; which the old
Poets often clamour for , were of supreme service ! In defect of any such
organ on our part , let the Reader stir up his own imaginative organ : let
us snatch for him this or the other significant glimpse of things , in
the fittest sequence we can .



Chapter 3.5.II.

Death .

In the early days of November , there is one transient glimpse of things
that is to be noted : the last transit to his long home of Philippe
d &apos;Orleans Egalite . Philippe was &apos; decreed accused , &apos; along with the
Girondins , much to his and their surprise ; but not tried along with
them . They are doomed and dead , some three days , when Philippe , after
his long half @-@ year of durance at Marseilles , arrives in Paris . It is , as
we calculate , the third of November 1793 .

On which same day , two notable Female Prisoners are also put in ward
there : Dame Dubarry and Josephine Beauharnais ! Dame whilom Countess
Dubarry , Unfortunate @-@ female , had returned from London ; they snatched
her , not only as Ex @-@ harlot of a whilom Majesty , and therefore suspect ;
but as having &apos; furnished the Emigrants with money . &apos; Contemporaneously
with whom , there comes the wife of Beauharnais , soon to be the widow :
she that is Josephine Tascher Beauharnais ; that shall be Josephine
Empress Buonaparte , for a black Divineress of the Tropics prophesied
long since that she should be a Queen and more . Likewise , in the same
hours , poor Adam Lux , nigh turned in the head , who , according to Foster ,
&apos;has taken no food these three weeks , &apos; marches to the Guillotine for his
Pamphlet on Charlotte Corday : he &apos; sprang to the scaffold ; &apos; said he
&apos;died for her with great joy . &apos; Amid such fellow @-@ travellers does Philippe
arrive . For , be the month named Brumaire year 2 of Liberty , or November
year 1793 of Slavery , the Guillotine goes always , Guillotine va
toujours .

Enough , Philippe &apos;s indictment is soon drawn , his jury soon convinced . He
finds himself made guilty of Royalism , Conspiracy and much else ; nay ,
it is a guilt in him that he voted Louis &apos;s Death , though he answers , &quot; I
voted in my soul and conscience . &quot; The doom he finds is death forthwith ;
this present sixth dim day of November is the last day that Philippe
is to see . Philippe , says Montgaillard , thereupon called for breakfast :
sufficiency of &apos; oysters , two cutlets , best part of an excellent bottle
of claret ; &apos; and consumed the same with apparent relish . A Revolutionary
Judge , or some official Convention Emissary , then arrived , to signify
that he might still do the State some service by revealing the truth
about a plot or two . Philippe answered that , on him , in the pass things
had come to , the State had , he thought , small claim ; that nevertheless ,
in the interest of Liberty , he , having still some leisure on his hands ,
was willing , were a reasonable question asked him , to give reasonable
answer . And so , says Montgaillard , he lent his elbow on the
mantel @-@ piece , and conversed in an under @-@ tone , with great seeming
composure ; till the leisure was done , or the Emissary went his ways .

At the door of the Conciergerie , Philippe &apos;s attitude was erect and easy ,
almost commanding . It is five years , all but a few days , since Philippe ,
within these same stone walls , stood up with an air of graciosity , and
asked King Louis , &quot; Whether it was a Royal Session , then , or a Bed of
Justice ? &quot; O Heaven ! -- Three poor blackguards were to ride and die with
him : some say , they objected to such company , and had to be flung in ,
neck and heels ; ( Foster , ii . 628 ; Montgaillard , iv . 141 @-@ 57 . ) but it
seems not true . Objecting or not objecting , the gallows @-@ vehicle gets
under way . Philippe &apos;s dress is remarked for its elegance ; greenfrock ,
waistcoat of white pique , yellow buckskins , boots clear as Warren :
his air , as before , entirely composed , impassive , not to say easy
and Brummellean @-@ polite . Through street after street ; slowly , amid
execrations ; -- past the Palais Egalite whilom Palais @-@ Royal ! The cruel
Populace stopped him there , some minutes : Dame de Buffon , it is said ,
looked out on him , in Jezebel head @-@ tire ; along the ashlar Wall , there
ran these words in huge tricolor print , REPUBLIC ONE AND INDIVISIBLE ;
LIBERTY , EQUALITY , FRATERNITY OR DEATH : National Property . Philippe &apos;s
eyes flashed hellfire , one instant ; but the next instant it was gone ,
and he sat impassive , Brummellean @-@ polite . On the scaffold , Samson was
for drawing of his boots : &quot; tush , &quot; said Philippe , &quot; they will come better
off after ; let us have done , depechons @-@ nous ! &quot;

So Philippe was not without virtue , then ? God forbid that there should
be any living man without it ! He had the virtue to keep living for
five @-@ and @-@ forty years ; -- other virtues perhaps more than we know of .
Probably no mortal ever had such things recorded of him : such facts , and
also such lies . For he was a Jacobin Prince of the Blood ; consider what
a combination ! Also , unlike any Nero , any Borgia , he lived in the Age of
Pamphlets . Enough for us : Chaos has reabsorbed him ; may it late or never
bear his like again ! -- Brave young Orleans Egalite , deprived of all , only
not deprived of himself , is gone to Coire in the Grisons , under the name
of Corby , to teach Mathematics . The Egalite Family is at the darkest
depths of the Nadir .

A far nobler Victim follows ; one who will claim remembrance from several
centuries : Jeanne @-@ Marie Phlipon , the Wife of Roland . Queenly , sublime
in her uncomplaining sorrow , seemed she to Riouffe in her Prison .
&apos;Something more than is usually found in the looks of women painted
itself , &apos; says Riouffe , ( Memoires , Sur les Prisons , i . , pp. 55 @-@ 7 . ) &apos; in
those large black eyes of hers , full of expression and sweetness . She
spoke to me often , at the Grate : we were all attentive round her , in
a sort of admiration and astonishment ; she expressed herself with a
purity , with a harmony and prosody that made her language like music , of
which the ear could never have enough . Her conversation was serious ,
not cold ; coming from the mouth of a beautiful woman , it was frank and
courageous as that of a great men . &apos; &apos; And yet her maid said : &quot; Before you ,
she collects her strength ; but in her own room , she will sit three hours
sometimes , leaning on the window , and weeping . &quot; &apos; She had been in Prison ,
liberated once , but recaptured the same hour , ever since the first of
June : in agitation and uncertainty ; which has gradually settled down
into the last stern certainty , that of death . In the Abbaye Prison , she
occupied Charlotte Corday &apos;s apartment . Here in the Conciergerie , she
speaks with Riouffe , with Ex @-@ Minister Claviere ; calls the beheaded
Twenty @-@ two &quot; Nos amis , our Friends , &quot; -- whom we are soon to follow . During
these five months , those Memoirs of hers were written , which all the
world still reads .

But now , on the 8th of November , &apos; clad in white , &apos; says Riouffe , &apos; with
her long black hair hanging down to her girdle , &apos; she is gone to the
Judgment Bar . She returned with a quick step ; lifted her finger , to
signify to us that she was doomed : her eyes seemed to have been wet .
Fouquier @-@ Tinville &apos;s questions had been &apos; brutal ; &apos; offended female honour
flung them back on him , with scorn , not without tears . And now , short
preparation soon done , she shall go her last road . There went with her
a certain Lamarche , &apos; Director of Assignat printing ; &apos; whose dejection she
endeavoured to cheer . Arrived at the foot of the scaffold , she asked for
pen and paper , &quot; to write the strange thoughts that were rising in her ; &quot;
( Memoires de Madame Roland introd . , i . 68 . ) a remarkable request ;
which was refused . Looking at the Statue of Liberty which stands there ,
she says bitterly : &quot; O Liberty , what things are done in thy name ! &quot; For
Lamarche &apos;s sake , she will die first ; shew him how easy it is to die :
&quot; Contrary to the order &quot; said Samson . -- &quot; Pshaw , you cannot refuse the last
request of a Lady ; &quot; and Samson yielded .

Noble white Vision , with its high queenly face , its soft proud eyes ,
long black hair flowing down to the girdle ; and as brave a heart as ever
beat in woman &apos;s bosom ! Like a white Grecian Statue , serenely complete ,
she shines in that black wreck of things ; -- long memorable . Honour to
great Nature who , in Paris City , in the Era of Noble @-@ Sentiment and
Pompadourism , can make a Jeanne Phlipon , and nourish her to clear
perennial Womanhood , though but on Logics , Encyclopedies , and the Gospel
according to Jean @-@ Jacques ! Biography will long remember that trait of
asking for a pen &quot; to write the strange thoughts that were rising in
her . &quot; It is as a little light @-@ beam , shedding softness , and a kind
of sacredness , over all that preceded : so in her too there was an
Unnameable ; she too was a Daughter of the Infinite ; there were mysteries
which Philosophism had not dreamt of ! -- She left long written counsels to
her little Girl ; she said her Husband would not survive her .

Still crueller was the fate of poor Bailly , First National President ,
First Mayor of Paris : doomed now for Royalism , Fayettism ; for that
Red @-@ Flag Business of the Champ @-@ de @-@ Mars ; -- one may say in general , for
leaving his Astronomy to meddle with Revolution . It is the 10th of
November 1793 , a cold bitter drizzling rain , as poor Bailly is led
through the streets ; howling Populace covering him with curses , with
mud ; waving over his face a burning or smoking mockery of a Red Flag .
Silent , unpitied , sits the innocent old man . Slow faring through
the sleety drizzle , they have got to the Champ @-@ de @-@ Mars : Not there !
vociferates the cursing Populace ; Such blood ought not to stain an Altar
of the Fatherland ; not there ; but on that dungheap by the River @-@ side !
So vociferates the cursing Populace ; Officiality gives ear to them .
The Guillotine is taken down , though with hands numbed by the sleety
drizzle ; is carried to the River @-@ side , is there set up again , with slow
numbness ; pulse after pulse still counting itself out in the old man &apos;s
weary heart . For hours long ; amid curses and bitter frost @-@ rain ! &quot; Bailly ,
thou tremblest , &quot; said one . &quot; Mon ami , it is for cold , &quot; said Bailly ,
&quot; c &apos;est de froid . &quot; Crueller end had no mortal . ( Vie de Bailly in
Memoires , i . , p . 29 . )

Some days afterwards , Roland hearing the news of what happened on the
8th , embraces his kind Friends at Rouen , leaves their kind house which
had given him refuge ; goes forth , with farewell too sad for tears . On
the morrow morning , 16th of the month , &apos; some four leagues from Rouen ,
Paris @-@ ward , near Bourg @-@ Baudoin , in M. Normand &apos;s Avenue , &apos; there is seen
sitting leant against a tree , the figure of rigorous wrinkled man ; stiff
now in the rigour of death ; a cane @-@ sword run through his heart ; and at
his feet this writing : &apos; Whoever thou art that findest me lying , respect
my remains : they are those of a man who consecrated all his life to
being useful ; and who has died as he lived , virtuous and honest . &apos; &apos; Not
fear , but indignation , made me quit my retreat , on learning that my Wife
had been murdered . I wished not to remain longer on an Earth polluted
with crimes . &apos; ( Memoires de Madame Roland introd . , i . 88 . )

Barnave &apos;s appearance at the Revolutionary Tribunal was of the bravest ;
but it could not stead him . They have sent for him from Grenoble ; to pay
the common smart , Vain is eloquence , forensic or other , against the dumb
Clotho @-@ shears of Tinville . He is still but two @-@ and @-@ thirty , this Barnave ,
and has known such changes . Short while ago , we saw him at the top of
Fortune &apos;s Wheel , his word a law to all Patriots : and now surely he is
at the bottom of the Wheel ; in stormful altercation with a Tinville
Tribunal , which is dooming him to die ! ( Foster , ii . 629 . ) And Petion ,
once also of the Extreme Left , and named Petion Virtue , where is he ?
Civilly dead ; in the Caves of Saint @-@ Emilion ; to be devoured of dogs . And
Robespierre , who rode along with him on the shoulders of the people , is
in Committee of Salut ; civilly alive : not to live always . So giddy @-@ swift
whirls and spins this immeasurable tormentum of a Revolution ;
wild @-@ booming ; not to be followed by the eye . Barnave , on the Scaffold ,
stamped his foot ; and looking upwards was heard to ejaculate , &quot; This then
is my reward ? &quot;

Deputy Ex @-@ Procureur Manuel is already gone ; and Deputy Osselin , famed
also in August and September , is about to go : and Rabaut , discovered
treacherously between his two walls , and the Brother of Rabaut . National
Deputies not a few ! And Generals : the memory of General Custine cannot
be defended by his Son ; his Son is already guillotined . Custine the
Ex @-@ Noble was replaced by Houchard the Plebeian : he too could not prosper
in the North ; for him too there was no mercy ; he has perished in the
Place de la Revolution , after attempting suicide in Prison . And Generals
Biron , Beauharnais , Brunet , whatsoever General prospers not ; tough old
Luckner , with his eyes grown rheumy ; Alsatian Westermann , valiant and
diligent in La Vendee : none of them can , as the Psalmist sings , his soul
from death deliver .

How busy are the Revolutionary Committees ; Sections with their Forty
Halfpence a @-@ day ! Arrestment on arrestment falls quick , continual ;
followed by death . Ex @-@ Minister Claviere has killed himself in Prison .
Ex @-@ Minister Lebrun , seized in a hayloft , under the disguise of a
working man , is instantly conducted to death . ( Moniteur , 11 Decembre ,
30 Decembre , 1793 ; Louvet , p . 287 . ) Nay , withal , is it not what Barrere
calls &apos; coining money on the Place de la Revolution ? &apos; For always the
&apos;property of the guilty , if property he have , &apos; is confiscated . To avoid
accidents , we even make a Law that suicide shall not defraud us ; that a
criminal who kills himself does not the less incur forfeiture of goods .
Let the guilty tremble , therefore , and the suspect , and the rich , and in
a word all manner of culottic men ! Luxembourg Palace , once Monsieur &apos;s ,
has become a huge loathsome Prison ; Chantilly Palace too , once
Conde &apos;s : -- and their Landlords are at Blankenberg , on the wrong side
of the Rhine . In Paris are now some Twelve Prisons ; in France some
Forty @-@ four Thousand : thitherward , thick as brown leaves in Autumn ,
rustle and travel the suspect ; shaken down by Revolutionary Committees ,
they are swept thitherward , as into their storehouse , -- to be consumed by
Samson and Tinville . &apos; The Guillotine goes not ill , ne va pas mal . &apos; 



Chapter 3.5.III.

Destruction .

The suspect may well tremble ; but how much more the open rebels ; -- the
Girondin Cities of the South ! Revolutionary Army is gone forth , under
Ronsin the Playwright ; six thousand strong ; in &apos; red nightcap , in
tricolor waistcoat , in black @-@ shag trousers , black @-@ shag spencer , with
enormous moustachioes , enormous sabre , -- in carmagnole complete ; &apos; ( See
Louvet , p . 301 . ) and has portable guillotines . Representative Carrier
has got to Nantes , by the edge of blazing La Vendee , which Rossignol
has literally set on fire : Carrier will try what captives you make , what
accomplices they have , Royalist or Girondin : his guillotine goes always ,
va toujours ; and his wool @-@ capped &apos; Company of Marat . &apos; Little children are
guillotined , and aged men . Swift as the machine is , it will not serve ;
the Headsman and all his valets sink , worn down with work ; declare that
the human muscles can no more . ( Deux Amis , xii . 249 @-@ 51 . ) Whereupon you
must try fusillading ; to which perhaps still frightfuller methods may
succeed .

In Brest , to like purpose , rules Jean @-@ Bon Saint @-@ Andre ; with an Army
of Red Nightcaps . In Bourdeaux rules Tallien , with his Isabeau and
henchmen : Guadets , Cussys , Salleses , may fall ; the bloody Pike and
Nightcap bearing supreme sway ; the Guillotine coining money . Bristly
fox @-@ haired Tallien , once Able Editor , still young in years , is now
become most gloomy , potent ; a Pluto on Earth , and has the keys of
Tartarus . One remarks , however , that a certain Senhorina Cabarus , or
call her rather Senhora and wedded not yet widowed Dame de Fontenai ,
brown beautiful woman , daughter of Cabarus the Spanish merchant , -- has
softened the red bristly countenance ; pleading for herself and friends ;
and prevailing . The keys of Tartarus , or any kind of power , are
something to a woman ; gloomy Pluto himself is not insensible to love .
Like a new Proserpine , she , by this red gloomy Dis , is gathered ; and ,
they say , softens his stone heart a little .

Maignet , at Orange in the South ; Lebon , at Arras in the North ,
become world &apos;s wonders . Jacobin Popular Tribunal , with its National
Representative , perhaps where Girondin Popular Tribunal had lately
been , rises here and rises there ; wheresoever needed . Fouches , Maignets ,
Barrases , Frerons scour the Southern Departments ; like reapers , with
their guillotine @-@ sickle . Many are the labourers , great is the harvest .
By the hundred and the thousand , men &apos;s lives are cropt ; cast like brands
into the burning .

Marseilles is taken , and put under martial law : lo , at Marseilles , what
one besmutted red @-@ bearded corn @-@ ear is this which they cut ; -- one
gross Man , we mean , with copper @-@ studded face ; plenteous beard , or
beard @-@ stubble , of a tile @-@ colour ? By Nemesis and the Fatal Sisters , it
is Jourdan Coupe @-@ tete ! Him they have clutched , in these martial @-@ law
districts ; him too , with their &apos; national razor , &apos; their rasoir national ,
they sternly shave away . Low now is Jourdan the Headsman &apos;s own
head ; -- low as Deshuttes &apos;s and Varigny &apos;s , which he sent on pikes , in the
Insurrection of Women ! No more shall he , as a copper Portent , be seen
gyrating through the Cities of the South ; no more sit judging , with
pipes and brandy , in the Ice @-@ tower of Avignon . The all @-@ hiding Earth has
received him , the bloated Tilebeard : may we never look upon his like
again ! -- Jourdan one names ; the other Hundreds are not named . Alas ,
they , like confused faggots , lie massed together for us ; counted by the
cartload : and yet not an individual faggot @-@ twig of them but had a Life
and History ; and was cut , not without pangs as when a Kaiser dies !

Least of all cities can Lyons escape . Lyons , which we saw in dread
sunblaze , that Autumn night when the Powder @-@ tower sprang aloft , was
clearly verging towards a sad end . Inevitable : what could desperate
valour and Precy do ; Dubois @-@ Crance , deaf as Destiny , stern as Doom ,
capturing their &apos; redouts of cotton @-@ bags ; &apos; hemming them in , ever closer ,
with his Artillery @-@ lava ? Never would that Ci @-@ devant d &apos;Autichamp arrive ;
never any help from Blankenberg . The Lyons Jacobins were hidden in
cellars ; the Girondin Municipality waxed pale , in famine , treason and
red fire . Precy drew his sword , and some Fifteen Hundred with him ;
sprang to saddle , to cut their way to Switzerland . They cut fiercely ;
and were fiercely cut , and cut down ; not hundreds , hardly units of
them ever saw Switzerland . ( Deux Amis , xi . 145 . ) Lyons , on the 9th of
October , surrenders at discretion ; it is become a devoted Town . Abbe
Lamourette , now Bishop Lamourette , whilom Legislator , he of the old
Baiser @-@ l &apos;Amourette or Delilah @-@ Kiss , is seized here , is sent to Paris to
be guillotined : &apos; he made the sign of the cross , &apos; they say when
Tinville intimated his death @-@ sentence to him ; and died as an eloquent
Constitutional Bishop . But wo now to all Bishops , Priests , Aristocrats
and Federalists that are in Lyons ! The manes of Chalier are to be
appeased ; the Republic , maddened to the Sibylline pitch , has bared her
right arm . Behold ! Representative Fouche , it is Fouche of Nantes , a name
to become well known ; he with a Patriot company goes duly , in wondrous
Procession , to raise the corpse of Chalier . An Ass , housed in Priest &apos;s
cloak , with a mitre on its head , and trailing the Mass @-@ Books , some say
the very Bible , at its tail , paces through Lyons streets ; escorted by
multitudinous Patriotism , by clangour as of the Pit ; towards the grave
of Martyr Chalier . The body is dug up and burnt : the ashes are collected
in an Urn ; to be worshipped of Paris Patriotism . The Holy Books were
part of the funeral pile ; their ashes are scattered to the wind .
Amid cries of &quot; Vengeance ! Vengeance ! &quot; -- which , writes Fouche , shall be
satisfied . ( Moniteur ( du 17 Novembre 1793 ) , &amp; c . )

Lyons in fact is a Town to be abolished ; not Lyons henceforth but
&apos;Commune Affranchie , Township Freed ; &apos; the very name of it shall perish .
It is to be razed , this once great City , if Jacobinism prophesy right ;
and a Pillar to be erected on the ruins , with this Inscription , Lyons
rebelled against the Republic ; Lyons is no more . Fouche , Couthon ,
Collot , Convention Representatives succeed one another : there is work
for the hangman ; work for the hammerman , not in building . The very
Houses of Aristocrats , we say , are doomed . Paralytic Couthon , borne in
a chair , taps on the wall , with emblematic mallet , saying , &quot; La Loi te
frappe , The Law strikes thee ; &quot; masons , with wedge and crowbar , begin
demolition . Crash of downfall , dim ruin and dust @-@ clouds fly in the
winter wind . Had Lyons been of soft stuff , it had all vanished in those
weeks , and the Jacobin prophecy had been fulfilled . But Towns are not
built of soap @-@ froth ; Lyons Town is built of stone . Lyons , though it
rebelled against the Republic , is to this day .

Neither have the Lyons Girondins all one neck , that you could despatch
it at one swoop . Revolutionary Tribunal here , and Military Commission ,
guillotining , fusillading , do what they can : the kennels of the Place
des Terreaux run red ; mangled corpses roll down the Rhone . Collot
d &apos;Herbois , they say , was once hissed on the Lyons stage : but with what
sibilation , of world @-@ catcall or hoarse Tartarean Trumpet , will ye hiss
him now , in this his new character of Convention Representative , -- not to
be repeated ! Two hundred and nine men are marched forth over the River ,
to be shot in mass , by musket and cannon , in the Promenade of the
Brotteaux . It is the second of such scenes ; the first was of some
Seventy . The corpses of the first were flung into the Rhone , but the
Rhone stranded some ; so these now , of the second lot , are to be buried
on land . Their one long grave is dug ; they stand ranked , by the loose
mould @-@ ridge ; the younger of them singing the Marseillaise . Jacobin
National Guards give fire ; but have again to give fire , and again ; and
to take the bayonet and the spade , for though the doomed all fall , they
do not all die ; -- and it becomes a butchery too horrible for speech . So
that the very Nationals , as they fire , turn away their faces . Collot ,
snatching the musket from one such National , and levelling it with
unmoved countenance , says &quot; It is thus a Republican ought to fire . &quot;

This is the second Fusillade , and happily the last : it is found too
hideous ; even inconvenient . They were Two hundred and nine marched out ;
one escaped at the end of the Bridge : yet behold , when you count the
corpses , they are Two hundred and ten . Rede us this riddle , O Collot ?
After long guessing , it is called to mind that two individuals , here
in the Brotteaux ground , did attempt to leave the rank , protesting
with agony that they were not condemned men , that they were Police
Commissaries : which two we repulsed , and disbelieved , and shot with
the rest ! ( Deux Amis , xii . 251 @-@ 62 . ) Such is the vengeance of an enraged
Republic . Surely this , according to Barrere &apos;s phrase , is Justice &apos; under
rough forms , sous des formes acerbes . &apos; But the Republic , as Fouche says ,
must &quot; march to Liberty over corpses . &quot; Or again as Barrere has it : &quot; None
but the dead do not come back , Il n &apos;y a que les morts qui ne reviennent
pas . &quot; Terror hovers far and wide : &apos; The Guillotine goes not ill . &apos; 

But before quitting those Southern regions , over which History can cast
only glances from aloft , she will alight for a moment , and look fixedly
at one point : the Siege of Toulon . Much battering and bombarding ,
heating of balls in furnaces or farm @-@ houses , serving of artillery well
and ill , attacking of Ollioules Passes , Forts Malbosquet , there has
been : as yet to small purpose . We have had General Cartaux here , a
whilom Painter elevated in the troubles of Marseilles ; General Doppet ,
a whilom Medical man elevated in the troubles of Piemont , who , under
Crance , took Lyons , but cannot take Toulon . Finally we have General
Dugommier , a pupil of Washington . Convention Representans also we have
had ; Barrases , Salicettis , Robespierres the Younger : -- also an Artillery
Chef de brigade , of extreme diligence , who often takes his nap of sleep
among the guns ; a short taciturn , olive @-@ complexioned young man , not
unknown to us , by name Buonaparte : one of the best Artillery @-@ officers
yet met with . And still Toulon is not taken . It is the fourth month now ;
December , in slave @-@ style ; Frostarious or Frimaire , in new @-@ style : and
still their cursed Red @-@ Blue Flag flies there . They are provisioned from
the Sea ; they have seized all heights , felling wood , and fortifying
themselves ; like the coney , they have built their nest in the rocks .

Meanwhile , Frostarious is not yet become Snowous or Nivose , when a
Council of War is called ; Instructions have just arrived from Government
and Salut Public . Carnot , in Salut Public , has sent us a plan of siege :
on which plan General Dugommier has this criticism to make , Commissioner
Salicetti has that ; and criticisms and plans are very various ; when
that young Artillery Officer ventures to speak ; the same whom we saw
snatching sleep among the guns , who has emerged several times in this
History , -- the name of him Napoleon Buonaparte . It is his humble opinion ,
for he has been gliding about with spy @-@ glasses , with thoughts , That a
certain Fort l &apos;Eguillette can be clutched , as with lion @-@ spring , on the
sudden ; wherefrom , were it once ours , the very heart of Toulon might be
battered , the English Lines were , so to speak , turned inside out , and
Hood and our Natural Enemies must next day either put to sea , or be
burnt to ashes . Commissioners arch their eyebrows , with negatory sniff :
who is this young gentleman with more wit than we all ? Brave veteran
Dugommier , however , thinks the idea worth a word ; questions the young
gentleman ; becomes convinced ; and there is for issue , Try it .

On the taciturn bronze @-@ countenance , therefore , things being now all
ready , there sits a grimmer gravity than ever , compressing a hotter
central @-@ fire than ever . Yonder , thou seest , is Fort l &apos;Eguillette ; a
desperate lion @-@ spring , yet a possible one ; this day to be tried ! -- Tried
it is ; and found good . By stratagem and valour , stealing through
ravines , plunging fiery through the fire @-@ tempest , Fort l &apos;Eguillette is
clutched at , is carried ; the smoke having cleared , wiser the Tricolor
fly on it : the bronze @-@ complexioned young man was right . Next morning ,
Hood , finding the interior of his lines exposed , his defences turned
inside out , makes for his shipping . Taking such Royalists as wished
it on board with him , he weighs anchor : on this 19th of December 1793,
Toulon is once more the Republic &apos;s !

Cannonading has ceased at Toulon ; and now the guillotining and
fusillading may begin . Civil horrors , truly : but at least that infamy
of an English domination is purged away . Let there be Civic Feast
universally over France : so reports Barrere , or Painter David ; and the
Convention assist in a body . ( Moniteur , 1793 , Nos. 101 ( 31 Decembre ) ,
95 , 96 , 98 , &amp; c . ) Nay , it is said , these infamous English ( with an
attention rather to their own interests than to ours ) set fire to our
store @-@ houses , arsenals , warships in Toulon Harbour , before weighing ;
some score of brave warships , the only ones we now had ! However , it did
not prosper , though the flame spread far and high ; some two ships were
burnt , not more ; the very galley @-@ slaves ran with buckets to quench .
These same proud Ships , Ships l &apos;Orient and the rest , have to carry this
same young Man to Egypt first : not yet can they be changed to ashes , or
to Sea @-@ Nymphs ; not yet to sky @-@ rockets , O Ship l &apos;Orient , nor became the
prey of England , -- before their time !

And so , over France universally , there is Civic Feast and high @-@ tide :
and Toulon sees fusillading , grape @-@ shotting in mass , as Lyons saw ; and
&apos;death is poured out in great floods , vomie a grands flots &apos; and Twelve
thousand Masons are requisitioned from the neighbouring country , to raze
Toulon from the face of the Earth . For it is to be razed , so reports
Barrere ; all but the National Shipping Establishments ; and to be
called henceforth not Toulon , but Port of the Mountain . There in black
death @-@ cloud we must leave it ; -- hoping only that Toulon too is built of
stone ; that perhaps even Twelve thousand Masons cannot pull it down ,
till the fit pass .

One begins to be sick of &apos; death vomited in great floods . &apos; Nevertheless
hearest thou not , O reader ( for the sound reaches through centuries ) ,
in the dead December and January nights , over Nantes Town , -- confused
noises , as of musketry and tumult , as of rage and lamentation ; mingling
with the everlasting moan of the Loire waters there ? Nantes Town is
sunk in sleep ; but Representant Carrier is not sleeping , the wool @-@ capped
Company of Marat is not sleeping . Why unmoors that flatbottomed craft ,
that gabarre ; about eleven at night ; with Ninety Priests under hatches ?
They are going to Belle Isle ? In the middle of the Loire stream , on
signal given , the gabarre is scuttled ; she sinks with all her cargo .
&apos;Sentence of Deportation , &apos; writes Carrier , &apos; was executed vertically . &apos; 
The Ninety Priests , with their gabarre @-@ coffin , lie deep ! It is the
first of the Noyades , what we may call Drownages , of Carrier ; which have
become famous forever .

Guillotining there was at Nantes , till the Headsman sank worn out : then
fusillading &apos; in the Plain of Saint @-@ Mauve ; &apos; little children fusilladed ,
and women with children at the breast ; children and women , by the
hundred and twenty ; and by the five hundred , so hot is La Vendee : till
the very Jacobins grew sick , and all but the Company of Marat cried ,
Hold ! Wherefore now we have got Noyading ; and on the 24th night of
Frostarious year 2 , which is 14th of December 1793 , we have a second
Noyade : consisting of &apos; a Hundred and Thirty @-@ eight persons . &apos; ( Deux Amis ,
xii . 266 @-@ 72 ; Moniteur , du 2 Janvier 1794 . )

Or why waste a gabarre , sinking it with them ? Fling them out ; fling them
out , with their hands tied : pour a continual hail of lead over all the
space , till the last struggler of them be sunk ! Unsound sleepers of
Nantes , and the Sea @-@ Villages thereabouts , hear the musketry amid the
night @-@ winds ; wonder what the meaning of it is . And women were in that
gabarre ; whom the Red Nightcaps were stripping naked ; who begged , in
their agony , that their smocks might not be stript from them . And young
children were thrown in , their mothers vainly pleading : &quot; Wolflings , &quot;
answered the Company of Marat , &quot; who would grow to be wolves . &quot;

By degrees , daylight itself witnesses Noyades : women and men are tied
together , feet and feet , hands and hands : and flung in : this they call
Mariage Republicain , Republican Marriage . Cruel is the panther of the
woods , the she @-@ bear bereaved of her whelps : but there is in man a hatred
crueller than that . Dumb , out of suffering now , as pale swoln corpses ,
the victims tumble confusedly seaward along the Loire stream ; the tide
rolling them back : clouds of ravens darken the River ; wolves prowl on
the shoal @-@ places : Carrier writes , &apos; Quel torrent revolutionnaire , What
a torrent of Revolution ! &apos; For the man is rabid ; and the Time is rabid .
These are the Noyades of Carrier ; twenty @-@ five by the tale , for what
is done in darkness comes to be investigated in sunlight : ( Proces de
Carrier , 4 tomes , Paris , 1795 . ) not to be forgotten for centuries , -- We
will turn to another aspect of the Consummation of Sansculottism ;
leaving this as the blackest .

But indeed men are all rabid ; as the Time is . Representative Lebon ,
at Arras , dashes his sword into the blood flowing from the Guillotine ;
exclaims , &quot; How I like it ! &quot; Mothers , they say , by his order , have to
stand by while the Guillotine devours their children : a band of music is
stationed near ; and , at the fall of every head , strikes up its ca @-@ ira .
( Les Horreures des Prisons d &apos;Arras , Paris , 1823 . ) In the Burgh of
Bedouin , in the Orange region , the Liberty @-@ tree has been cut down over
night . Representative Maignet , at Orange , hears of it ; burns Bedouin
Burgh to the last dog @-@ hutch ; guillotines the inhabitants , or drives
them into the caves and hills . ( Montgaillard , iv . 200 . ) Republic One and
Indivisible ! She is the newest Birth of Nature &apos;s waste inorganic Deep ,
which men name Orcus , Chaos , primeval Night ; and knows one law , that of
self @-@ preservation . Tigresse Nationale : meddle not with a whisker of her !
Swift @-@ crushing is her stroke ; look what a paw she spreads ; -- pity has not
entered her heart .

Prudhomme , the dull @-@ blustering Printer and Able Editor , as yet a Jacobin
Editor , will become a renegade one , and publish large volumes on these
matters , Crimes of the Revolution ; adding innumerable lies withal , as if
the truth were not sufficient . We , for our part , find it more edifying
to know , one good time , that this Republic and National Tigress is a New
Birth ; a Fact of Nature among Formulas , in an Age of Formulas ; and to
look , oftenest in silence , how the so genuine Nature @-@ Fact will demean
itself among these . For the Formulas are partly genuine , partly
delusive , supposititious : we call them , in the language of metaphor ,
regulated modelled shapes ; some of which have bodies and life still in
them ; most of which , according to a German Writer , have only emptiness ,
&apos;glass @-@ eyes glaring on you with a ghastly affectation of life , and in
their interior unclean accumulation of beetles and spiders ! &apos; But the
Fact , let all men observe , is a genuine and sincere one ; the sincerest
of Facts : terrible in its sincerity , as very Death . Whatsoever is
equally sincere may front it , and beard it ; but whatsoever is not ? --

Carmagnole complete .

Simultaneously with this Tophet @-@ black aspect , there unfolds itself
another aspect , which one may call a Tophet @-@ red aspect : the Destruction
of the Catholic Religion ; and indeed , for the time being of Religion
itself . We saw Romme &apos;s New Calendar establish its Tenth Day of Rest ;
and asked , what would become of the Christian Sabbath ? The Calendar
is hardly a month old , till all this is set at rest . Very singular , as
Mercier observes : last Corpus @-@ Christi Day 1792 , the whole world , and
Sovereign Authority itself , walked in religious gala , with a quite
devout air ; -- Butcher Legendre , supposed to be irreverent , was like to
be massacred in his Gig , as the thing went by . A Gallican Hierarchy , and
Church , and Church Formulas seemed to flourish , a little brown @-@ leaved or
so , but not browner than of late years or decades ; to flourish , far
and wide , in the sympathies of an unsophisticated People ; defying
Philosophism , Legislature and the Encyclopedie . Far and wide , alas ,
like a brown @-@ leaved Vallombrosa ; which waits but one whirlblast of the
November wind , and in an hour stands bare ! Since that Corpus @-@ Christi
Day , Brunswick has come , and the Emigrants , and La Vendee , and
eighteen months of Time : to all flourishing , especially to brown @-@ leaved
flourishing , there comes , were it never so slowly , an end .

On the 7th of November , a certain Citoyen Parens , Curate of
Boissise @-@ le @-@ Bertrand , writes to the Convention that he has all his life
been preaching a lie , and is grown weary of doing it ; wherefore he will
now lay down his Curacy and stipend , and begs that an august Convention
would give him something else to live upon . &apos; Mention honorable , &apos; shall
we give him ? Or &apos; reference to Committee of Finances ? &apos; Hardly is this
got decided , when goose Gobel , Constitutional Bishop of Paris , with his
Chapter , with Municipal and Departmental escort in red nightcaps ,
makes his appearance , to do as Parens has done . Goose Gobel will
now acknowledge &apos; no Religion but Liberty ; &apos; therefore he doffs his
Priest @-@ gear , and receives the Fraternal embrace . To the joy of
Departmental Momoro , of Municipal Chaumettes and Heberts , of Vincent
and the Revolutionary Army ! Chaumette asks , Ought there not , in these
circumstances , to be among our intercalary Days Sans @-@ breeches , a Feast
of Reason ? ( Moniteur , Seance du 17 Brumaire ( 7th November ) , 1793 . )
Proper surely ! Let Atheist Marechal , Lalande , and little Atheist Naigeon
rejoice ; let Clootz , Speaker of Mankind , present to the Convention his
Evidences of the Mahometan Religion , &apos; a work evincing the nullity of all
Religions , &apos; -- with thanks . There shall be Universal Republic now , thinks
Clootz ; and &apos; one God only , Le Peuple . &apos; 

The French Nation is of gregarious imitative nature ; it needed but a
fugle @-@ motion in this matter ; and goose Gobel , driven by Municipality and
force of circumstances , has given one . What Cure will be behind him
of Boissise ; what Bishop behind him of Paris ? Bishop Gregoire , indeed ,
courageously declines ; to the sound of &quot; We force no one ; let Gregoire
consult his conscience ; &quot; but Protestant and Romish by the hundred
volunteer and assent . From far and near , all through November into
December , till the work is accomplished , come Letters of renegation ,
come Curates who are &apos; learning to be Carpenters , &apos; Curates with their
new @-@ wedded Nuns : has not the Day of Reason dawned , very swiftly ,
and become noon ? From sequestered Townships comes Addresses , stating
plainly , though in Patois dialect , That &apos; they will have no more to
do with the black animal called Curay , animal noir , appelle Curay . &apos; 
( Analyse du Moniteur ( Paris , 1801 ) , ii . 280 . )

Above all things there come Patriotic Gifts , of Church @-@ furniture . The
remnant of bells , except for tocsin , descend from their belfries , into
the National meltingpot , to make cannon . Censers and all sacred vessels
are beaten broad ; of silver , they are fit for the poverty @-@ stricken Mint ;
of pewter , let them become bullets to shoot the &apos; enemies of du genre
humain . &apos; Dalmatics of plush make breeches for him who has none ;
linen stoles will clip into shirts for the Defenders of the Country :
old @-@ clothesmen , Jew or Heathen , drive the briskest trade . Chalier &apos;s
Ass Procession , at Lyons , was but a type of what went on , in those
same days , in all Towns . In all Towns and Townships as quick as the
guillotine may go , so quick goes the axe and the wrench : sacristies ,
lutrins , altar @-@ rails are pulled down ; the Mass Books torn into cartridge
papers : men dance the Carmagnole all night about the bonfire . All
highways jingle with metallic Priest @-@ tackle , beaten broad ; sent to the
Convention , to the poverty @-@ stricken Mint . Good Sainte Genevieve &apos;s Chasse
is let down : alas , to be burst open , this time , and burnt on the Place
de Greve . Saint Louis &apos;s shirt is burnt ; -- might not a Defender of the
Country have had it ? At Saint @-@ Denis Town , no longer Saint @-@ Denis but
Franciade , Patriotism has been down among the Tombs , rummaging ; the
Revolutionary Army has taken spoil . This , accordingly , is what the
streets of Paris saw :

&apos;Most of these persons were still drunk , with the brandy they had
swallowed out of chalices ; -- eating mackerel on the patenas ! Mounted on
Asses , which were housed with Priests &apos; cloaks , they reined them with
Priests &apos; stoles : they held clutched with the same hand communion @-@ cup
and sacred wafer . They stopped at the doors of Dramshops ; held out
ciboriums : and the landlord , stoop in hand , had to fill them thrice .
Next came Mules high @-@ laden with crosses , chandeliers , censers ,
holy @-@ water vessels , hyssops ; -- recalling to mind the Priests of Cybele ,
whose panniers , filled with the instruments of their worship , served
at once as storehouse , sacristy and temple . In such equipage did these
profaners advance towards the Convention . They enter there , in an
immense train , ranged in two rows ; all masked like mummers in
fantastic sacerdotal vestments ; bearing on hand @-@ barrows their heaped
plunder , -- ciboriums , suns , candelabras , plates of gold and silver . &apos; 
( Mercier , iv . 134 . See Moniteur , Seance du 10 Novembre . )

The Address we do not give ; for indeed it was in strophes , sung viva
voce , with all the parts ; -- Danton glooming considerably , in his place ;
and demanding that there be prose and decency in future . ( See also
Moniteur , Seance du 26 Novembre . ) Nevertheless the captors of such
spolia opima crave , not untouched with liquor , permission to dance the
Carmagnole also on the spot : whereto an exhilarated Convention cannot
but accede . Nay , &apos; several Members , &apos; continues the exaggerative Mercier ,
who was not there to witness , being in Limbo now , as one of Duperret &apos;s
Seventy @-@ three , &apos; several Members , quitting their curule chairs , took the
hand of girls flaunting in Priest &apos;s vestures , and danced the Carmagnole
along with them . &apos; Such Old @-@ Hallow @-@ tide have they , in this year , once
named of Grace , 1793 .

Out of which strange fall of Formulas , tumbling there in confused
welter , betrampled by the Patriotic dance , is it not passing strange to
see a new Formula arise ? For the human tongue is not adequate to
speak what &apos; triviality run distracted &apos; there is in human nature . Black
Mumbo @-@ Jumbo of the woods , and most Indian Wau @-@ waus , one can understand :
but this of Procureur Anaxagoras whilom John @-@ Peter Chaumette ? We
will say only : Man is a born idol @-@ worshipper , sight @-@ worshipper , so
sensuous @-@ imaginative is he ; and also partakes much of the nature of the
ape .

For the same day , while this brave Carmagnole dance has hardly jigged
itself out , there arrive Procureur Chaumette and Municipals and
Departmentals , and with them the strangest freightage : a New Religion !
Demoiselle Candeille , of the Opera ; a woman fair to look upon , when well
rouged : she , borne on palanquin shoulder @-@ high ; with red woolen nightcap ;
in azure mantle ; garlanded with oak ; holding in her hand the Pike of
the Jupiter @-@ Peuple , sails in ; heralded by white young women girt in
tricolor . Let the world consider it ! This , O National Convention wonder
of the universe , is our New Divinity ; Goddess of Reason , worthy , and
alone worthy of revering . Nay , were it too much to ask of an august
National Representation that it also went with us to the ci @-@ devant
Cathedral called of Notre @-@ Dame , and executed a few strophes in worship
of her ?

President and Secretaries give Goddess Candeille , borne at due height
round their platform , successively the fraternal kiss ; whereupon she , by
decree , sails to the right @-@ hand of the President and there alights .
And now , after due pause and flourishes of oratory , the Convention ,
gathering its limbs , does get under way in the required procession
towards Notre @-@ Dame ; -- Reason , again in her litter , sitting in the van
of them , borne , as one judges , by men in the Roman costume ; escorted
by wind @-@ music , red nightcaps , and the madness of the world . And so
straightway , Reason taking seat on the high @-@ altar of Notre @-@ Dame , the
requisite worship or quasi @-@ worship is , say the Newspapers , executed ;
National Convention chanting &apos; the Hymn to Liberty , words by Chenier ,
music by Gossec . &apos; It is the first of the Feasts of Reason ; first
communion @-@ service of the New Religion of Chaumette .

&apos;The corresponding Festival in the Church of Saint @-@ Eustache , &apos; says
Mercier , &apos; offered the spectacle of a great tavern . The interior of the
choir represented a landscape decorated with cottages and boskets of
trees . Round the choir stood tables over @-@ loaded with bottles , with
sausages , pork @-@ puddings , pastries and other meats . The guests flowed in
and out through all doors : whosoever presented himself took part of
the good things : children of eight , girls as well as boys , put hand to
plate , in sign of Liberty ; they drank also of the bottles , and their
prompt intoxication created laughter . Reason sat in azure mantle aloft ,
in a serene manner ; Cannoneers , pipe in mouth , serving her as acolytes .
And out of doors , &apos; continues the exaggerative man , &apos; were mad multitudes
dancing round the bonfire of Chapel @-@ balustrades , of Priests &apos; and Canons&apos;
stalls ; and the dancers , I exaggerate nothing , the dancers nigh bare
of breeches , neck and breast naked , stockings down , went whirling
and spinning , like those Dust @-@ vortexes , forerunners of Tempest and
Destruction . &apos; ( Mercier , iv . 127 @-@ 146 . ) At Saint @-@ Gervais Church again
there was a terrible &apos; smell of herrings ; &apos; Section or Municipality having
provided no food , no condiment , but left it to chance . Other mysteries ,
seemingly of a Cabiric or even Paphian character , we heave under the
Veil , which appropriately stretches itself &apos; along the pillars of the
aisles , &apos; -- not to be lifted aside by the hand of History .

But there is one thing we should like almost better to understand
than any other : what Reason herself thought of it , all the while . What
articulate words poor Mrs. Momoro , for example , uttered ; when she had
become ungoddessed again , and the Bibliopolist and she sat quiet at
home , at supper ? For he was an earnest man , Bookseller Momoro ; and had
notions of Agrarian Law . Mrs. Momoro , it is admitted , made one of the
best Goddesses of Reason ; though her teeth were a little defective . And
now if the reader will represent to himself that such visible Adoration
of Reason went on &apos; all over the Republic , &apos; through these November and
December weeks , till the Church woodwork was burnt out , and the business
otherwise completed , he will feel sufficiently what an adoring Republic
it was , and without reluctance quit this part of the subject .

Such gifts of Church @-@ spoil are chiefly the work of the Armee
Revolutionnaire ; raised , as we said , some time ago . It is an Army
with portable guillotine : commanded by Playwright Ronsin in terrible
moustachioes ; and even by some uncertain shadow of Usher Maillard , the
old Bastille Hero , Leader of the Menads , September Man in Grey ! Clerk
Vincent of the War @-@ Office , one of Pache &apos;s old Clerks , &apos; with a head
heated by the ancient orators , &apos; had a main hand in the appointments , at
least in the staff @-@ appointments .

But of the marchings and retreatings of these Six Thousand no Xenophon
exists . Nothing , but an inarticulate hum , of cursing and sooty frenzy ,
surviving dubious in the memory of ages ! They scour the country round
Paris ; seeking Prisoners ; raising Requisitions ; seeing that Edicts
are executed , that the Farmers have thrashed sufficiently ; lowering
Church @-@ bells or metallic Virgins . Detachments shoot forth dim , towards
remote parts of France ; nay new Provincial Revolutionary Armies rise
dim , here and there , as Carrier &apos;s Company of Marat , as Tallien &apos;s
Bourdeaux Troop ; like sympathetic clouds in an atmosphere all electric .
Ronsin , they say , admitted , in candid moments , that his troops were
the elixir of the Rascality of the Earth . One sees them drawn up in
market @-@ places ; travel @-@ plashed , rough @-@ bearded , in carmagnole complete :
the first exploit is to prostrate what Royal or Ecclesiastical monument ,
crucifix or the like , there may be ; to plant a cannon at the steeple ,
fetch down the bell without climbing for it , bell and belfry together .
This , however , it is said , depends somewhat on the size of the town :
if the town contains much population , and these perhaps of a dubious
choleric aspect , the Revolutionary Army will do its work gently , by
ladder and wrench ; nay perhaps will take its billet without work at all ;
and , refreshing itself with a little liquor and sleep , pass on to the
next stage . ( Deux Amis , xii . 62 @-@ 5 . ) Pipe in cheek , sabre on thigh ; in
carmagnole complete !

Such things have been ; and may again be . Charles Second sent out his
Highland Host over the Western Scotch Whigs ; Jamaica Planters got
Dogs from the Spanish Main to hunt their Maroons with : France too is
bescoured with a Devil &apos;s Pack , the baying of which , at this distance of
half a century , still sounds in the mind &apos;s ear .



Chapter 3.5.V.

Like a Thunder @-@ Cloud .

But the grand , and indeed substantially primary and generic aspect of
the Consummation of Terror remains still to be looked at ; nay blinkard
History has for most part all but overlooked this aspect , the soul of
the whole : that which makes it terrible to the Enemies of France . Let
Despotism and Cimmerian Coalitions consider . All French men and French
things are in a State of Requisition ; Fourteen Armies are got on foot ;
Patriotism , with all that it has of faculty in heart or in head , in soul
or body or breeches @-@ pocket , is rushing to the frontiers , to prevail
or die ! Busy sits Carnot , in Salut Public ; busy for his share , in
&apos;organising victory . &apos; Not swifter pulses that Guillotine , in dread
systole @-@ diastole in the Place de la Revolution , than smites the Sword
of Patriotism , smiting Cimmeria back to its own borders , from the sacred
soil .

In fact the Government is what we can call Revolutionary ; and some men
are &apos; a la hauteur , &apos; on a level with the circumstances ; and others are
not a la hauteur , -- so much the worse for them . But the Anarchy , we may
say , has organised itself : Society is literally overset ; its old forces
working with mad activity , but in the inverse order ; destructive and
self @-@ destructive .

Curious to see how all still refers itself to some head and fountain ;
not even an Anarchy but must have a centre to revolve round . It is now
some six months since the Committee of Salut Public came into existence :
some three months since Danton proposed that all power should be given
it and &apos; a sum of fifty millions , &apos; and the &apos; Government be declared
Revolutionary . &apos; He himself , since that day , would take no hand in it ,
though again and again solicited ; but sits private in his place on
the Mountain . Since that day , the Nine , or if they should even rise to
Twelve have become permanent , always re @-@ elected when their term runs
out ; Salut Public , Surete Generale have assumed their ulterior form and
mode of operating .

Committee of Public Salvation , as supreme ; of General Surety , as
subaltern : these like a Lesser and Greater Council , most harmonious
hitherto , have become the centre of all things . They ride this
Whirlwind ; they , raised by force of circumstances , insensibly , very
strangely , thither to that dread height ; -- and guide it , and seem to
guide it . Stranger set of Cloud @-@ Compellers the Earth never saw . A
Robespierre , a Billaud , a Collot , Couthon , Saint @-@ Just ; not to mention
still meaner Amars , Vadiers , in Surete Generale : these are your
Cloud @-@ Compellers . Small intellectual talent is necessary : indeed where
among them , except in the head of Carnot , busied organising victory ,
would you find any ? The talent is one of instinct rather . It is that of
divining aright what this great dumb Whirlwind wishes and wills ; that
of willing , with more frenzy than any one , what all the world wills .
To stand at no obstacles ; to heed no considerations human or divine ; to
know well that , of divine or human , there is one thing needful , Triumph
of the Republic , Destruction of the Enemies of the Republic ! With this
one spiritual endowment , and so few others , it is strange to see how a
dumb inarticulately storming Whirlwind of things puts , as it were , its
reins into your hand , and invites and compels you to be leader of it .

Hard by , sits a Municipality of Paris ; all in red nightcaps since
the fourth of November last : a set of men fully &apos; on a level with
circumstances , &apos; or even beyond it . Sleek Mayor Pache , studious to be
safe in the middle ; Chaumettes , Heberts , Varlets , and Henriot their
great Commandant ; not to speak of Vincent the War @-@ clerk , of Momoros ,
Dobsents , and such like : all intent to have Churches plundered , to have
Reason adored , Suspects cut down , and the Revolution triumph . Perhaps
carrying the matter too far ? Danton was heard to grumble at the civic
strophes ; and to recommend prose and decency . Robespierre also grumbles
that in overturning Superstition we did not mean to make a religion
of Atheism . In fact , your Chaumette and Company constitute a kind
of Hyper @-@ Jacobinism , or rabid &apos; Faction des Enrages ; &apos; which has given
orthodox Patriotism some umbrage , of late months . To &apos; know a Suspect on
the streets : &apos; what is this but bringing the Law of the Suspect itself
into ill odour ? Men half @-@ frantic , men zealous overmuch , -- they toil
there , in their red nightcaps , restlessly , rapidly , accomplishing what
of Life is allotted them .

And the Forty @-@ four Thousand other Townships , each with revolutionary
Committee , based on Jacobin Daughter Society ; enlightened by the
spirit of Jacobinism ; quickened by the Forty Sous a @-@ day ! -- The French
Constitution spurned always at any thing like Two Chambers ; and yet
behold , has it not verily got Two Chambers ? National Convention , elected
for one ; Mother of Patriotism , self @-@ elected , for another ! Mother of
Patriotism has her Debates reported in the Moniteur , as important
state @-@ procedures ; which indisputably they are . A Second Chamber of
Legislature we call this Mother Society ; -- if perhaps it were not rather
comparable to that old Scotch Body named Lords of the Articles , without
whose origination , and signal given , the so @-@ called Parliament could
introduce no bill , could do no work ? Robespierre himself , whose words
are a law , opens his incorruptible lips copiously in the Jacobins Hall .
Smaller Council of Salut Public , Greater Council of Surete Generale , all
active Parties , come here to plead ; to shape beforehand what decision
they must arrive at , what destiny they have to expect . Now if a
question arose , Which of those Two Chambers , Convention , or Lords of the
Articles , was the stronger ? Happily they as yet go hand in hand .

As for the National Convention , truly it has become a most composed
Body . Quenched now the old effervescence ; the Seventy @-@ three locked in
ward ; once noisy Friends of the Girondins sunk all into silent men
of the Plain , called even &apos; Frogs of the Marsh , &apos; Crapauds du Marais !
Addresses come , Revolutionary Church @-@ plunder comes ; Deputations , with
prose , or strophes : these the Convention receives . But beyond this ,
the Convention has one thing mainly to do : to listen what Salut Public
proposes , and say , Yea .

Bazire followed by Chabot , with some impetuosity , declared , one morning ,
that this was not the way of a Free Assembly . &quot; There ought to be an
Opposition side , a Cote Droit , &quot; cried Chabot ; &quot; if none else will form
it , I will : people say to me , You will all get guillotined in your turn ,
first you and Bazire , then Danton , then Robespierre himself . &quot; ( Debats ,
du 10 Novembre , 1723 . ) So spake the Disfrocked , with a loud voice : next
week , Bazire and he lie in the Abbaye ; wending , one may fear , towards
Tinville and the Axe ; and &apos; people say to me &apos; -- what seems to be proving
true ! Bazire &apos;s blood was all inflamed with Revolution fever ; with
coffee and spasmodic dreams . ( Dictionnaire des Hommes Marquans , i . 115 . )
Chabot , again , how happy with his rich Jew @-@ Austrian wife , late Fraulein
Frey ! But he lies in Prison ; and his two Jew @-@ Austrian Brothers @-@ in @-@ Law ,
the Bankers Frey , lie with him ; waiting the urn of doom . Let a National
Convention , therefore , take warning , and know its function . Let the
Convention , all as one man , set its shoulder to the work ; not with
bursts of Parliamentary eloquence , but in quite other and serviceable
ways !

Convention Commissioners , what we ought to call Representatives ,
&apos;Representans on mission , &apos; fly , like the Herald Mercury , to all points
of the Territory ; carrying your behests far and wide . In their &apos; round
hat plumed with tricolor feathers , girt with flowing tricolor taffeta ;
in close frock , tricolor sash , sword and jack @-@ boots , &apos; these men are
powerfuller than King or Kaiser . They say to whomso they meet , Do ; and
he must do it : all men &apos;s goods are at their disposal ; for France is as
one huge City in Siege . They smite with Requisitions , and Forced @-@ loan ;
they have the power of life and death . Saint @-@ Just and Lebas order the
rich classes of Strasburg to &apos; strip off their shoes , &apos; and send them to
the Armies where as many as &apos; ten thousand pairs &apos; are needed . Also , that
within four and twenty hours , &apos; a thousand beds &apos; are to be got ready ;
( Moniteur , du 27 Novembre 1793 . ) wrapt in matting , and sent under way .
For the time presses ! -- Like swift bolts , issuing from the fuliginous
Olympus of Salut Public rush these men , oftenest in pairs ; scatter
your thunder @-@ orders over France ; make France one enormous Revolutionary
thunder @-@ cloud .



Chapter 3.5.VI.

Do thy Duty .

Accordingly alongside of these bonfires of Church balustrades , and
sounds of fusillading and noyading , there rise quite another sort of
fires and sounds : Smithy @-@ fires and Proof @-@ volleys for the manufacture of
arms .

Cut off from Sweden and the world , the Republic must learn to make steel
for itself ; and , by aid of Chemists , she has learnt it . Towns that
knew only iron , now know steel : from their new dungeons at Chantilly ,
Aristocrats may hear the rustle of our new steel furnace there . Do
not bells transmute themselves into cannon ; iron stancheons into the
white @-@ weapon ( arme blanche ) , by sword @-@ cutlery ? The wheels of Langres
scream , amid their sputtering fire halo ; grinding mere swords . The
stithies of Charleville ring with gun @-@ making . What say we , Charleville ?
Two hundred and fifty @-@ eight Forges stand in the open spaces of Paris
itself ; a hundred and forty of them in the Esplanade of the Invalides ,
fifty @-@ four in the Luxembourg Garden : so many Forges stand ; grim Smiths
beating and forging at lock and barrel there . The Clockmakers have come ,
requisitioned , to do the touch @-@ holes , the hard @-@ solder and filework . Five
great Barges swing at anchor on the Seine Stream , loud with boring ; the
great press @-@ drills grating harsh thunder to the general ear and heart .
And deft Stock @-@ makers do gouge and rasp ; and all men bestir themselves ,
according to their cunning : -- in the language of hope , it is reckoned
that a &apos; thousand finished muskets can be delivered daily . &apos; ( Choix des
Rapports , xiii . 189 . ) Chemists of the Republic have taught us
miracles of swift tanning ; ( Ibid. xv . 360 . ) the cordwainer bores and
stitches ; -- not of &apos; wood and pasteboard , &apos; or he shall answer it
to Tinville ! The women sew tents and coats , the children scrape
surgeon &apos;s @-@ lint , the old men sit in the market @-@ places ; able men are
on march ; all men in requisition : from Town to Town flutters , on the
Heaven &apos;s winds , this Banner , THE FRENCH PEOPLE RISEN AGAINST TYRANTS .

All which is well . But now arises the question : What is to be done for
saltpetre ? Interrupted Commerce and the English Navy shut us out from
saltpetre ; and without saltpetre there is no gunpowder . Republican
Science again sits meditative ; discovers that saltpetre exists here and
there , though in attenuated quantity : that old plaster of walls holds
a sprinkling of it ; -- that the earth of the Paris Cellars holds a
sprinkling of it , diffused through the common rubbish ; that were these
dug up and washed , saltpetre might be had . Whereupon swiftly , see ! the
Citoyens , with upshoved bonnet rouge , or with doffed bonnet , and hair
toil @-@ wetted ; digging fiercely , each in his own cellar , for saltpetre .
The Earth @-@ heap rises at every door ; the Citoyennes with hod and bucket
carrying it up ; the Citoyens , pith in every muscle , shovelling and
digging : for life and saltpetre . Dig my braves ; and right well speed ye .
What of saltpetre is essential the Republic shall not want .

Consummation of Sansculottism has many aspects and tints : but the
brightest tint , really of a solar or stellar brightness , is this which
the Armies give it . That same fervour of Jacobinism which internally
fills France with hatred , suspicions , scaffolds and Reason @-@ worship ,
does , on the Frontiers , shew itself as a glorious Pro patria mori . Ever
since Dumouriez &apos;s defection , three Convention Representatives attend
every General . Committee of Salut has sent them , often with this Laconic
order only : &quot; Do thy duty , Fais ton devoir . &quot; It is strange , under what
impediments the fire of Jacobinism , like other such fires , will burn .
These Soldiers have shoes of wood and pasteboard , or go booted in
hayropes , in dead of winter ; they skewer a bass mat round their
shoulders , and are destitute of most things . What then ? It is for Rights
of Frenchhood , of Manhood , that they fight : the unquenchable spirit ,
here as elsewhere , works miracles . &quot; With steel and bread , &quot; says the
Convention Representative , &quot; one may get to China . &quot; The Generals go fast
to the guillotine ; justly and unjustly . From which what inference ? This
among others : That ill @-@ success is death ; that in victory alone is life !
To conquer or die is no theatrical palabra , in these circumstances : but
a practical truth and necessity . All Girondism , Halfness , Compromise is
swept away . Forward , ye Soldiers of the Republic , captain and man !
Dash with your Gaelic impetuosity , on Austria , England , Prussia , Spain ,
Sardinia ; Pitt , Cobourg , York , and the Devil and the World ! Behind us
is but the Guillotine ; before us is Victory , Apotheosis and Millennium
without end !

See accordingly , on all Frontiers , how the Sons of Night , astonished
after short triumph , do recoil ; -- the Sons of the Republic flying at
them , with wild ca @-@ ira or Marseillese Aux armes , with the temper of
cat @-@ o &apos; -mountain , or demon incarnate ; which no Son of Night can stand !
Spain , which came bursting through the Pyrenees , rustling with Bourbon
banners , and went conquering here and there for a season , falters at
such cat @-@ o &apos; -mountain welcome ; draws itself in again ; too happy now were
the Pyrenees impassable . Not only does Dugommier , conqueror of Toulon ,
drive Spain back ; he invades Spain . General Dugommier invades it by the
Eastern Pyrenees ; General Dugommier invades it by the Eastern Pyrenees ;
General Muller shall invade it by the Western . Shall , that is the word :
Committee of Salut Public has said it ; Representative Cavaignac , on
mission there , must see it done . Impossible ! cries Muller , -- Infallible !
answers Cavaignac . Difficulty , impossibility , is to no purpose .
&quot; The Committee is deaf on that side of its head , &quot; answers Cavaignac ,
&quot; n &apos;entend pas de cette oreille la . How many wantest thou , of men , of
horses , cannons ? Thou shalt have them . Conquerors , conquered or hanged ,
forward we must . &quot; ( There is , in Prudhomme , an atrocity a la Captain @-@ Kirk
reported of this Cavaignac ; which has been copied into Dictionaries of
Hommes Marquans , of Biographie Universelle , &amp; c . ; which not only has no
truth in it , but , much more singular , is still capable of being proved
to have none . ) Which things also , even as the Representative spake them ,
were done . The Spring of the new Year sees Spain invaded : and redoubts
are carried , and Passes and Heights of the most scarped description ;
Spanish Field @-@ officerism struck mute at such cat @-@ o &apos; -mountain spirit , the
cannon forgetting to fire . ( Deux Amis , xiii . 205 @-@ 30 ; Toulongeon , &amp; c . )
Swept are the Pyrenees ; Town after Town flies up , burst by terror or
the petard . In the course of another year , Spain will crave Peace ;
acknowledge its sins and the Republic ; nay , in Madrid , there will be joy
as for a victory , that even Peace is got .

Few things , we repeat , can be notabler than these Convention
Representatives , with their power more than kingly . Nay at bottom are
they not Kings , Ablemen , of a sort ; chosen from the Seven Hundred and
Forty @-@ nine French Kings ; with this order , Do thy duty ? Representative
Levasseur , of small stature , by trade a mere pacific Surgeon @-@ Accoucheur ,
has mutinies to quell ; mad hosts ( mad at the Doom of Custine ) bellowing
far and wide ; he alone amid them , the one small Representative , -- small ,
but as hard as flint , which also carries fire in it ! So too , at
Hondschooten , far in the afternoon , he declares that the battle is
not lost ; that it must be gained ; and fights , himself , with his own
obstetric hand ; -- horse shot under him , or say on foot , &apos; up to the
haunches in tide @-@ water ; &apos; cutting stoccado and passado there , in defiance
of Water , Earth , Air and Fire , the choleric little Representative
that he was ! Whereby , as natural , Royal Highness of York had to
withdraw , -- occasionally at full gallop ; like to be swallowed by the
tide : and his Siege of Dunkirk became a dream , realising only much loss
of beautiful siege @-@ artillery and of brave lives . ( Levasseur , Memoires ,
ii. c . 2 @-@ 7 . )

General Houchard , it would appear , stood behind a hedge , on this
Hondschooten occasion ; wherefore they have since guillotined him . A new
General Jourdan , late Serjeant Jourdan , commands in his stead : he ,
in long @-@ winded Battles of Watigny , &apos; murderous artillery @-@ fire mingling
itself with sound of Revolutionary battle @-@ hymns , &apos; forces Austria behind
the Sambre again ; has hopes of purging the soil of Liberty . With hard
wrestling , with artillerying and ca @-@ ira @-@ ing , it shall be done . In the
course of a new Summer , Valenciennes will see itself beleaguered ; Conde
beleaguered ; whatsoever is yet in the hands of Austria beleaguered and
bombarded : nay , by Convention Decree , we even summon them all &apos; either
to surrender in twenty @-@ four hours , or else be put to the sword ; &apos; -- a high
saying , which , though it remains unfulfilled , may shew what spirit one
is of .

Representative Drouet , as an Old @-@ Dragoon , could fight by a kind of
second nature ; but he was unlucky . Him , in a night @-@ foray at Maubeuge ,
the Austrians took alive , in October last . They stript him almost naked ,
he says ; making a shew of him , as King @-@ taker of Varennes . They flung him
into carts ; sent him far into the interior of Cimmeria , to &apos; a Fortress
called Spitzberg &apos; on the Danube River ; and left him there , at an
elevation of perhaps a hundred and fifty feet , to his own bitter
reflections . Reflections ; and also devices ! For the indomitable
Old @-@ dragoon constructs wing @-@ machinery , of Paperkite ; saws window @-@ bars :
determines to fly down . He will seize a boat , will follow the
River &apos;s course : land somewhere in Crim Tartary , in the Black Sea or
Constantinople region : a la Sindbad ! Authentic History , accordingly ,
looking far into Cimmeria , discerns dimly a phenomenon . In the dead
night @-@ watches , the Spitzberg sentry is near fainting with terror : Is
it a huge vague Portent descending through the night air ? It is a
huge National Representative Old @-@ dragoon , descending by Paperkite ; too
rapidly , alas ! For Drouet had taken with him &apos; a small provision @-@ store ,
twenty pounds weight or thereby ; &apos; which proved accelerative : so he fell ,
fracturing his leg ; and lay there , moaning , till day dawned , till you
could discern clearly that he was not a Portent but a Representative !
( His narrative in Deux Amis , xiv . 177 @-@ 86 . )

Or see Saint @-@ Just , in the Lines of Weissembourg , though physically of
a timid apprehensive nature , how he charges with his &apos; Alsatian Peasants
armed hastily &apos; for the nonce ; the solemn face of him blazing into flame ;
his black hair and tricolor hat @-@ taffeta flowing in the breeze ; These our
Lines of Weissembourg were indeed forced , and Prussia and the Emigrants
rolled through : but we re @-@ force the Lines of Weissembourg ; and Prussia
and the Emigrants roll back again still faster , -- hurled with bayonet
charges and fiery ca @-@ ira @-@ ing .

Ci @-@ devant Serjeant Pichegru , ci @-@ devant Serjeant Hoche , risen now to
be Generals , have done wonders here . Tall Pichegru was meant for
the Church ; was Teacher of Mathematics once , in Brienne School , -- his
remarkablest Pupil there was the Boy Napoleon Buonaparte . He then , not
in the sweetest humour , enlisted exchanging ferula for musket ; and had
got the length of the halberd , beyond which nothing could be hoped ;
when the Bastille barriers falling made passage for him , and he is here .
Hoche bore a hand at the literal overturn of the Bastille ; he was , as we
saw , a Serjeant of the Gardes Francaises , spending his pay in rushlights
and cheap editions of books . How the Mountains are burst , and many an
Enceladus is disemprisoned : and Captains founding on Four parchments of
Nobility , are blown with their parchments across the Rhine , into Lunar
Limbo !

What high feats of arms , therefore , were done in these Fourteen Armies ;
and how , for love of Liberty and hope of Promotion , low @-@ born valour cut
its desperate way to Generalship ; and , from the central Carnot in Salut
Public to the outmost drummer on the Frontiers , men strove for their
Republic , let readers fancy . The snows of Winter , the flowers of Summer
continue to be stained with warlike blood . Gaelic impetuosity mounts
ever higher with victory ; spirit of Jacobinism weds itself to national
vanity : the Soldiers of the Republic are becoming , as we prophesied ,
very Sons of Fire . Barefooted , barebacked : but with bread and iron you
can get to China ! It is one Nation against the whole world ; but the
Nation has that within her which the whole world will not conquer .
Cimmeria , astonished , recoils faster or slower ; all round the Republic
there rises fiery , as it were , a magic ring of musket @-@ volleying and
ca @-@ ira @-@ ing . Majesty of Prussia , as Majesty of Spain , will by and by
acknowledge his sins and the Republic : and make a Peace of Bale .

Foreign Commerce , Colonies , Factories in the East and in the West , are
fallen or falling into the hands of sea @-@ ruling Pitt , enemy of human
nature . Nevertheless what sound is this that we hear , on the first of
June , 1794 ; sound of as war @-@ thunder borne from the Ocean too ; of tone
most piercing ? War @-@ thunder from off the Brest waters : Villaret @-@ Joyeuse
and English Howe , after long manoeuvring have ranked themselves there ;
and are belching fire . The enemies of human nature are on their own
element ; cannot be conquered ; cannot be kept from conquering . Twelve
hours of raging cannonade ; sun now sinking westward through the
battle @-@ smoke : six French Ships taken , the Battle lost ; what Ship soever
can still sail , making off ! But how is it , then , with that Vengeur Ship ,
she neither strikes nor makes off ? She is lamed , she cannot make off ;
strike she will not . Fire rakes her fore and aft , from victorious
enemies ; the Vengeur is sinking . Strong are ye , Tyrants of the Sea ;
yet we also , are we weak ? Lo ! all flags , streamers , jacks , every rag of
tricolor that will yet run on rope , fly rustling aloft : the whole crew
crowds to the upper deck ; and , with universal soul @-@ maddening yell ,
shouts Vive la Republique , -- sinking , sinking . She staggers , she lurches ,
her last drunk whirl ; Ocean yawns abysmal : down rushes the Vengeur ,
carrying Vive la Republique along with her , unconquerable , into
Eternity ! ( Compare Barrere ( Chois des Rapports , xiv . 416 @-@ 21 ) ; Lord Howe
( Annual Register of 1794 , p . 86 ) , &amp; c . ) Let foreign Despots think of
that . There is an Unconquerable in man , when he stands on his Rights of
Man : let Despots and Slaves and all people know this , and only them that
stand on the Wrongs of Man tremble to know it .



Chapter 3.5.VII.

Flame @-@ Picture .


In this manner , mad @-@ blazing with flame of all imaginable tints , from
the red of Tophet to the stellar @-@ bright , blazes off this Consummation of
Sansculottism .

But the hundredth part of the things that were done , and the thousandth
part of the things that were projected and decreed to be done , would
tire the tongue of History . Statue of the Peuple Souverain , high as
Strasburg Steeple ; which shall fling its shadow from the Pont Neuf over
Jardin National and Convention Hall ; -- enormous , in Painter David &apos;s
head ! With other the like enormous Statues not a few : realised in paper
Decree . For , indeed , the Statue of Liberty herself is still but
Plaster in the Place de la Revolution ! Then Equalisation of Weights
and Measures , with decimal division ; Institutions , of Music and of much
else ; Institute in general ; School of Arts , School of Mars , Eleves de
la Patrie , Normal Schools : amid such Gun @-@ boring , Altar @-@ burning ,
Saltpetre @-@ digging , and miraculous improvements in Tannery !

What , for example , is this that Engineer Chappe is doing , in the Park of
Vincennes ? In the Park of Vincennes ; and onwards , they say , in the Park
of Lepelletier Saint @-@ Fargeau the assassinated Deputy ; and still onwards
to the Heights of Ecouen and further , he has scaffolding set up , has
posts driven in ; wooden arms with elbow joints are jerking and fugling
in the air , in the most rapid mysterious manner ! Citoyens ran up
suspicious . Yes , O Citoyens , we are signaling : it is a device this ,
worthy of the Republic ; a thing for what we will call Far @-@ writing
without the aid of postbags ; in Greek , it shall be named
Telegraph . -- Telegraphe sacre ! answers Citoyenism : For writing to
Traitors , to Austria ? -- and tears it down . Chappe had to escape , and
get a new Legislative Decree . Nevertheless he has accomplished it ,
the indefatigable Chappe : this Far @-@ writer , with its wooden arms and
elbow @-@ joints , can intelligibly signal ; and lines of them are set up , to
the North Frontiers and elsewhither . On an Autumn evening of the Year
Two , Far @-@ writer having just written that Conde Town has surrendered to
us , we send from Tuileries Convention Hall this response in the shape
of Decree : &apos; The name of Conde is changed to Nord @-@ Libre , North @-@ Free .
The Army of the North ceases not to merit well of the country . &apos; -- To the
admiration of men ! For lo , in some half hour , while the Convention yet
debates , there arrives this new answer : &apos; I inform thee , je t &apos;annonce ,
Citizen President , that the decree of Convention , ordering change of the
name Conde into North @-@ Free ; and the other declaring that the Army of
the North ceases not to merit well of the country , are transmitted and
acknowledged by Telegraph . I have instructed my Officer at Lille to
forward them to North @-@ Free by express . Signed , CHAPPE . &apos; ( Choix des
Rapports , xv . 378 , 384 . )

Or see , over Fleurus in the Netherlands , where General Jourdan , having
now swept the soil of Liberty , and advanced thus far , is just about to
fight , and sweep or be swept , things there not in the Heaven &apos;s Vault ,
some Prodigy , seen by Austrian eyes and spyglasses : in the similitude of
an enormous Windbag , with netting and enormous Saucer depending from it ?
A Jove &apos;s Balance , O ye Austrian spyglasses ? One saucer @-@ hole of a Jove &apos;s
Balance ; your poor Austrian scale having kicked itself quite aloft ,
out of sight ? By Heaven , answer the spyglasses , it is a Montgolfier , a
Balloon , and they are making signals ! Austrian cannon @-@ battery barks at
this Montgolfier ; harmless as dog at the Moon : the Montgolfier makes its
signals ; detects what Austrian ambuscade there may be , and descends
at its ease . ( 26th June , 1794 , see Rapport de Guyton @-@ Morveau sur les
aerostats , in Moniteur du 6 Vendemiaire , An 2 . ) What will not these
devils incarnate contrive ?

On the whole , is it not , O Reader , one of the strangest Flame @-@ Pictures
that ever painted itself ; flaming off there , on its ground of
Guillotine @-@ black ? And the nightly Theatres are Twenty @-@ three ; and
the Salons de danse are sixty : full of mere Egalite , Fraternite and
Carmagnole . And Section Committee @-@ rooms are Forty @-@ eight ; redolent of
tobacco and brandy : vigorous with twenty @-@ pence a @-@ day , coercing the
suspect . And the Houses of Arrest are Twelve for Paris alone ; crowded
and even crammed . And at all turns , you need your &apos; Certificate of
Civism ; &apos; be it for going out , or for coming in ; nay without it you
cannot , for money , get your daily ounces of bread . Dusky red @-@ capped
Baker &apos;s @-@ queues ; wagging themselves ; not in silence ! For we still live by
Maximum , in all things ; waited on by these two , Scarcity and Confusion .
The faces of men are darkened with suspicion ; with suspecting , or being
suspect . The streets lie unswept ; the ways unmended . Law has shut her
Books ; speaks little , save impromptu , through the throat of Tinville .
Crimes go unpunished : not crimes against the Revolution . ( Mercier , v.
25 ; Deux Amis , xii . 142 @-@ 199 . ) &apos; The number of foundling children , &apos; as
some compute , &apos; is doubled . &apos; 

How silent now sits Royalism ; sits all Aristocratism ; Respectability
that kept its Gig ! The honour now , and the safety , is to Poverty , not to
Wealth . Your Citizen , who would be fashionable , walks abroad , with
his Wife on his arm , in red wool nightcap , black shag spencer , and
carmagnole complete . Aristocratism crouches low , in what shelter is
still left ; submitting to all requisitions , vexations ; too happy
to escape with life . Ghastly chateaus stare on you by the wayside ;
disroofed , diswindowed ; which the National House @-@ broker is peeling for
the lead and ashlar . The old tenants hover disconsolate , over the Rhine
with Conde ; a spectacle to men . Ci @-@ devant Seigneur , exquisite in palate ,
will become an exquisite Restaurateur Cook in Hamburg ; Ci @-@ devant Madame ,
exquisite in dress , a successful Marchande des Modes in London . In
Newgate @-@ Street , you meet M. le Marquis , with a rough deal on his
shoulder , adze and jack @-@ plane under arm ; he has taken to the joiner
trade ; it being necessary to live ( faut vivre ) . ( See Deux Amis , xv .
189 @-@ 192 ; Memoires de Genlis ; Founders of the French Republic ,
&amp; c . &amp; c . ) -- Higher than all Frenchmen the domestic Stock @-@ jobber
flourishes , -- in a day of Paper @-@ money . The Farmer also flourishes :
&apos;Farmers &apos; houses , &apos; says Mercier , &apos; have become like Pawn @-@ brokers &apos; shops ; &apos;
all manner of furniture , apparel , vessels of gold and silver accumulate
themselves there : bread is precious . The Farmer &apos;s rent is Paper @-@ money ,
and he alone of men has bread : Farmer is better than Landlord , and will
himself become Landlord .

And daily , we say , like a black Spectre , silently through that
Life @-@ tumult , passes the Revolution Cart ; writing on the walls its MENE ,
MENE , Thou art weighed , and found wanting ! A Spectre with which one has
grown familiar . Men have adjusted themselves : complaint issues not from
that Death @-@ tumbril . Weak women and ci @-@ devants , their plumage and finery
all tarnished , sit there ; with a silent gaze , as if looking into the
Infinite Black . The once light lip wears a curl of irony , uttering no
word ; and the Tumbril fares along . They may be guilty before Heaven , or
not ; they are guilty , we suppose , before the Revolution . Then , does not
the Republic &apos; coin money &apos; of them , with its great axe ? Red Nightcaps
howl dire approval : the rest of Paris looks on ; if with a sigh , that is
much ; Fellow @-@ creatures whom sighing cannot help ; whom black Necessity
and Tinville have clutched .

One other thing , or rather two other things , we will still mention ;
and no more : The Blond Perukes ; the Tannery at Meudon . Great talk is
of these Perruques blondes : O Reader , they are made from the Heads of
Guillotined women ! The locks of a Duchess , in this way , may come to
cover the scalp of a Cordwainer : her blond German Frankism his black
Gaelic poll , if it be bald . Or they may be worn affectionately , as
relics ; rendering one suspect ? ( Mercier , ii . 134 . ) Citizens use them ,
not without mockery ; of a rather cannibal sort .

Still deeper into one &apos;s heart goes that Tannery at Meudon ; not mentioned
among the other miracles of tanning ! &apos; At Meudon , &apos; says Montgaillard with
considerable calmness , &apos; there was a Tannery of Human Skins ; such of
the Guillotined as seemed worth flaying : of which perfectly good
wash @-@ leather was made : &apos; for breeches , and other uses . The skin of the
men , he remarks , was superior in toughness ( consistance ) and quality
to shamoy ; that of women was good for almost nothing , being so soft
in texture ! ( Montgaillard , iv . 290 . ) -- History looking back over
Cannibalism , through Purchas &apos;s Pilgrims and all early and late Records ,
will perhaps find no terrestrial Cannibalism of a sort on the whole so
detestable . It is a manufactured , soft @-@ feeling , quietly elegant sort ; a
sort perfide ! Alas then , is man &apos;s civilisation only a wrappage , through
which the savage nature of him can still burst , infernal as ever ? Nature
still makes him ; and has an Infernal in her as well as a Celestial .

Chapter 3.6.I.

The Gods are athirst .

What then is this Thing , called La Revolution , which , like an Angel of
Death , hangs over France , noyading , fusillading , fighting , gun @-@ boring ,
tanning human skins ? La Revolution is but so many Alphabetic Letters ; a
thing nowhere to be laid hands on , to be clapt under lock and key : where
is it ? what is it ? It is the Madness that dwells in the hearts of men .
In this man it is , and in that man ; as a rage or as a terror , it is
in all men . Invisible , impalpable ; and yet no black Azrael , with wings
spread over half a continent , with sword sweeping from sea to sea , could
be a truer Reality .

To explain , what is called explaining , the march of this Revolutionary
Government , be no task of ours . Men cannot explain it . A paralytic
Couthon , asking in the Jacobins , &apos; what hast thou done to be hanged if
the Counter @-@ Revolution should arrive ; &apos; a sombre Saint @-@ Just , not yet
six @-@ and @-@ twenty , declaring that &apos; for Revolutionists there is no rest but
in the tomb ; &apos; a seagreen Robespierre converted into vinegar and gall ;
much more an Amar and Vadier , a Collot and Billaud : to inquire what
thoughts , predetermination or prevision , might be in the head of these
men ! Record of their thought remains not ; Death and Darkness have swept
it out utterly . Nay if we even had their thought , all they could have
articulately spoken to us , how insignificant a fraction were that of the
Thing which realised itself , which decreed itself , on signal given by
them ! As has been said more than once , this Revolutionary Government is
not a self @-@ conscious but a blind fatal one . Each man , enveloped in his
ambient @-@ atmosphere of revolutionary fanatic Madness , rushes on , impelled
and impelling ; and has become a blind brute Force ; no rest for him but
in the grave ! Darkness and the mystery of horrid cruelty cover it for
us , in History ; as they did in Nature . The chaotic Thunder @-@ cloud , with
its pitchy black , and its tumult of dazzling jagged fire , in a world
all electric : thou wilt not undertake to shew how that comported
itself , -- what the secrets of its dark womb were ; from what sources , with
what specialities , the lightning it held did , in confused brightness of
terror , strike forth , destructive and self @-@ destructive , till it ended ?
Like a Blackness naturally of Erebus , which by will of Providence
had for once mounted itself into dominion and the Azure : is not this
properly the nature of Sansculottism consummating itself ? Of which
Erebus Blackness be it enough to discern that this and the other
dazzling fire @-@ bolt , dazzling fire @-@ torrent , does by small Volition and
great Necessity , verily issue , -- in such and such succession ; destructive
so and so , self @-@ destructive so and so : till it end .

Royalism is extinct , &apos; sunk , &apos; as they say , &apos; in the mud of the Loire ; &apos;
Republicanism dominates without and within : what , therefore , on the 15th
day of March , 1794 , is this ? Arrestment , sudden really as a bolt out
of the Blue , has hit strange victims : Hebert Pere Duchene , Bibliopolist
Momoro , Clerk Vincent , General Ronsin ; high Cordelier Patriots ,
redcapped Magistrates of Paris , Worshippers of Reason , Commanders of
Revolutionary Army ! Eight short days ago , their Cordelier Club was loud ,
and louder than ever , with Patriot denunciations . Hebert Pere Duchene
had &quot; held his tongue and his heart these two months , at sight of
Moderates , Crypto @-@ Aristocrats , Camilles , Scelerats in the Convention
itself : but could not do it any longer ; would , if other remedy were not ,
invoke the Sacred right of Insurrection . &quot; So spake Hebert in Cordelier
Session ; with vivats , till the roofs rang again . ( Moniteur , du 17
Ventose ( 7th March ) 1794 . ) Eight short days ago ; and now already ! They
rub their eyes : it is no dream ; they find themselves in the Luxembourg .
Goose Gobel too ; and they that burnt Churches ! Chaumette himself , potent
Procureur , Agent National as they now call it , who could &apos; recognise the
Suspect by the very face of them , &apos; he lingers but three days ; on
the third day he too is hurled in . Most chopfallen , blue , enters the
National Agent this Limbo whither he has sent so many . Prisoners crowd
round , jibing and jeering : &quot; Sublime National Agent , &quot; says one , &quot; in
virtue of thy immortal Proclamation , lo there ! I am suspect , thou
art suspect , he is suspect , we are suspect , ye are suspect , they are
suspect ! &quot;

The meaning of these things ? Meaning ! It is a Plot ; Plot of the most
extensive ramifications ; which , however , Barrere holds the threads of .
Such Church @-@ burning and scandalous masquerades of Atheism , fit to make
the Revolution odious : where indeed could they originate but in the gold
of Pitt ? Pitt indubitably , as Preternatural Insight will teach one , did
hire this Faction of Enrages , to play their fantastic tricks ; to roar
in their Cordeliers Club about Moderatism ; to print their Pere Duchene ;
worship skyblue Reason in red nightcap ; rob all Altars , -- and bring the
spoil to us ! --

Still more indubitable , visible to the mere bodily sight , is this : that
the Cordeliers Club sits pale , with anger and terror ; and has &apos; veiled
the Rights of Man , &apos; -- without effect . Likewise that the Jacobins are in
considerable confusion ; busy &apos; purging themselves , &apos; s &apos;epurant , &apos; as , in
times of Plot and public Calamity , they have repeatedly had to do . Not
even Camille Desmoulins but has given offence : nay there have risen
murmurs against Danton himself ; though he bellowed them down , and
Robespierre finished the matter by &apos; embracing him in the Tribune . &apos; 

Whom shall the Republic and a jealous Mother Society trust ? In these
times of temptation , of Preternatural Insight ! For there are Factions
of the Stranger , &apos; de l &apos;etranger , &apos; Factions of Moderates , of Enraged ; all
manner of Factions : we walk in a world of Plots ; strings , universally
spread , of deadly gins and falltraps , baited by the gold of Pitt !
Clootz , Speaker of Mankind so @-@ called , with his Evidences of Mahometan
Religion , and babble of Universal Republic , him an incorruptible
Robespierre has purged away . Baron Clootz , and Paine rebellious
Needleman lie , these two months , in the Luxembourg ; limbs of the Faction
de l &apos;etranger . Representative Phelippeaux is purged out : he came back
from La Vendee with an ill report in his mouth against rogue Rossignol ,
and our method of warfare there . Recant it , O Phelippeaux , we entreat
thee ! Phelippeaux will not recant ; and is purged out . Representative
Fabre d &apos;Eglantine , famed Nomenclator of Romme &apos;s Calendar , is purged out ;
nay , is cast into the Luxembourg : accused of Legislative Swindling &apos; in
regard to monies of the India Company . &apos; There with his Chabots , Bazires ,
guilty of the like , let Fabre wait his destiny . And Westermann friend
of Danton , he who led the Marseillese on the Tenth of August , and fought
well in La Vendee , but spoke not well of rogue Rossignol , is purged out .
Lucky , if he too go not to the Luxembourg . And your Prolys , Guzmans , of
the Faction of the Stranger , they have gone ; Peyreyra , though he fled is
gone , &apos; taken in the disguise of a Tavern Cook . &apos; I am suspect , thou art
suspect , he is suspect ! --

The great heart of Danton is weary of it . Danton is gone to native
Arcis , for a little breathing time of peace : Away , black Arachne @-@ webs ,
thou world of Fury , Terror , and Suspicion ; welcome , thou everlasting
Mother , with thy spring greenness , thy kind household loves and
memories ; true art thou , were all else untrue ! The great Titan walks
silent , by the banks of the murmuring Aube , in young native haunts that
knew him when a boy ; wonders what the end of these things may be .

But strangest of all , Camille Desmoulins is purged out . Couthon gave as
a test in regard to Jacobin purgation the question , &apos; What hast thou
done to be hanged if Counter @-@ Revolution should arrive ? &apos; Yet Camille ,
who could so well answer this question , is purged out ! The truth is ,
Camille , early in December last , began publishing a new Journal , or
Series of Pamphlets , entitled the Vieux Cordelier , Old Cordelier .
Camille , not afraid at one time to &apos; embrace Liberty on a heap of
dead bodies , &apos; begins to ask now , Whether among so many arresting and
punishing Committees there ought not to be a &apos; Committee of Mercy ? &apos;
Saint @-@ Just , he observes , is an extremely solemn young Republican , who
&apos;carries his head as if it were a Saint @-@ Sacrement ; adorable Hostie , or
divine Real @-@ Presence ! Sharply enough , this old Cordelier , Danton and
he were of the earliest primary Cordeliers , -- shoots his glittering
war @-@ shafts into your new Cordeliers , your Heberts , Momoros , with their
brawling brutalities and despicabilities : say , as the Sun @-@ god ( for poor
Camille is a Poet ) shot into that Python Serpent sprung of mud .

Whereat , as was natural , the Hebertist Python did hiss and writhe
amazingly ; and threaten &apos; sacred right of Insurrection ; &apos; -- and , as we saw ,
get cast into Prison . Nay , with all the old wit , dexterity , and light
graceful poignancy , Camille , translating &apos; out of Tacitus , from the
Reign of Tiberius , &apos; pricks into the Law of the Suspect itself ; making it
odious ! Twice , in the Decade , his wild Leaves issue ; full of wit , nay
of humour , of harmonious ingenuity and insight , -- one of the strangest
phenomenon of that dark time ; and smite , in their wild @-@ sparkling way , at
various monstrosities , Saint @-@ Sacrament heads , and Juggernaut idols , in
a rather reckless manner . To the great joy of Josephine Beauharnais , and
the other Five Thousand and odd Suspect , who fill the Twelve Houses of
Arrest ; on whom a ray of hope dawns ! Robespierre , at first approbatory ,
knew not at last what to think ; then thought , with his Jacobins , that
Camille must be expelled . A man of true Revolutionary spirit , this
Camille ; but with the unwisest sallies ; whom Aristocrats and Moderates
have the art to corrupt ! Jacobinism is in uttermost crisis and struggle :
enmeshed wholly in plots , corruptibilities , neck @-@ gins and baited
falltraps of Pitt Ennemi du Genre Humain . Camille &apos;s First Number begins
with &apos; O Pitt ! &apos; -- his last is dated 15 Pluviose Year 2 , 3d February 1794 ;
and ends with these words of Montezuma &apos;s , &apos; Les dieux ont soif , The gods
are athirst . &apos; 

Be this as it may , the Hebertists lie in Prison only some nine days . On
the 24th of March , therefore , the Revolution Tumbrils carry through that
Life @-@ tumult a new cargo : Hebert , Vincent , Momoro , Ronsin , Nineteen of
them in all ; with whom , curious enough , sits Clootz Speaker of
Mankind . They have been massed swiftly into a lump , this miscellany of
Nondescripts ; and travel now their last road . No help . They too must
&apos;look through the little window ; &apos; they too &apos; must sneeze into the sack , &apos;
eternuer dans le sac ; as they have done to others so is it done to
them . Sainte @-@ Guillotine , meseems , is worse than the old Saints of
Superstition ; a man @-@ devouring Saint ? Clootz , still with an air of
polished sarcasm , endeavours to jest , to offer cheering &apos; arguments of
Materialism ; &apos; he requested to be executed last , &apos; in order to establish
certain principles , &apos; -- which Philosophy has not retained . General Ronsin
too , he still looks forth with some air of defiance , eye of command : the
rest are sunk in a stony paleness of despair . Momoro , poor Bibliopolist ,
no Agrarian Law yet realised , -- they might as well have hanged thee at
Evreux , twenty months ago , when Girondin Buzot hindered them . Hebert
Pere Duchene shall never in this world rise in sacred right of
insurrection ; he sits there low enough , head sunk on breast ; Red
Nightcaps shouting round him , in frightful parody of his Newspaper
Articles , &quot; Grand choler of the Pere Duchene ! &quot; Thus perish they ; the
sack receives all their heads . Through some section of History , Nineteen
spectre @-@ chimeras shall flit , speaking and gibbering ; till Oblivion
swallow them .

In the course of a week , the Revolutionary Army itself is disbanded ; the
General having become spectral . This Faction of Rabids , therefore , is
also purged from the Republican soil ; here also the baited falltraps of
that Pitt have been wrenched up harmless ; and anew there is joy over
a Plot Discovered . The Revolution then is verily devouring its own
children . All Anarchy , by the nature of it , is not only destructive but
self @-@ destructive .



Chapter 3.6.II.

Danton , No weakness .

Danton , meanwhile , has been pressingly sent for from Arcis : he must
return instantly , cried Camille , cried Phelippeaux and Friends , who
scented danger in the wind . Danger enough ! A Danton , a Robespierre ,
chief @-@ products of a victorious Revolution , are now arrived in immediate
front of one another ; must ascertain how they will live together , rule
together . One conceives easily the deep mutual incompatibility that
divided these two : with what terror of feminine hatred the poor seagreen
Formula looked at the monstrous colossal Reality , and grew greener
to behold him ; -- the Reality , again , struggling to think no ill of
a chief @-@ product of the Revolution ; yet feeling at bottom that such
chief @-@ product was little other than a chief wind @-@ bag , blown large by
Popular air ; not a man with the heart of a man , but a poor spasmodic
incorruptible pedant , with a logic @-@ formula instead of heart ; of Jesuit
or Methodist @-@ Parson nature ; full of sincere @-@ cant , incorruptibility , of
virulence , poltroonery ; barren as the east @-@ wind ! Two such chief @-@ products
are too much for one Revolution .

Friends , trembling at the results of a quarrel on their part , brought
them to meet . &quot; It is right , &quot; said Danton , swallowing much indignation ,
&quot; to repress the Royalists : but we should not strike except where it
is useful to the Republic ; we should not confound the innocent and the
guilty . &quot; -- &quot; And who told you , &quot; replied Robespierre with a poisonous look ,
&quot; that one innocent person had perished ? &quot; -- &quot; Quoi , &quot; said Danton , turning
round to Friend Paris self @-@ named Fabricius , Juryman in the Revolutionary
Tribunal : &quot; Quoi , not one innocent ? What sayest thou of it , Fabricius ! &quot;
( Biographie de Ministres , para Danton . ) -- Friends , Westermann , this Paris
and others urged him to shew himself , to ascend the Tribune and act . The
man Danton was not prone to shew himself ; to act , or uproar for his own
safety . A man of careless , large , hoping nature ; a large nature that
could rest : he would sit whole hours , they say , hearing Camille talk ,
and liked nothing so well . Friends urged him to fly ; his Wife urged him :
&quot; Whither fly ? &quot; answered he : &quot; If freed France cast me out , there are only
dungeons for me elsewhere . One carries not his country with him at the
sole of his shoe ! &quot; The man Danton sat still . Not even the arrestment
of Friend Herault , a member of Salut , yet arrested by Salut , can rouse
Danton . -- On the night of the 30th of March , Juryman Paris came rushing
in ; haste looking through his eyes : A clerk of the Salut Committee had
told him Danton &apos;s warrant was made out , he is to be arrested this very
night ! Entreaties there are and trepidation , of poor Wife , of Paris and
Friends : Danton sat silent for a while ; then answered , &quot; Ils n &apos;oseraient ,
They dare not ; &quot; and would take no measures . Murmuring &quot; They dare not , &quot;
he goes to sleep as usual .

And yet , on the morrow morning , strange rumour spreads over Paris City :
Danton , Camille , Phelippeaux , Lacroix have been arrested overnight !
It is verily so : the corridors of the Luxembourg were all crowded ,
Prisoners crowding forth to see this giant of the Revolution among them .
&quot; Messieurs , &quot; said Danton politely , &quot; I hoped soon to have got you all
out of this : but here I am myself ; and one sees not where it will
end . &quot; -- Rumour may spread over Paris : the Convention clusters itself
into groups ; wide @-@ eyed , whispering , &quot; Danton arrested ! &quot; Who then is safe ?
Legendre , mounting the Tribune , utters , at his own peril , a feeble word
for him ; moving that he be heard at that Bar before indictment ; but
Robespierre frowns him down : &quot; Did you hear Chabot , or Bazire ? Would you
have two weights and measures ? &quot; Legendre cowers low ; Danton , like the
others , must take his doom .

Danton &apos;s Prison @-@ thoughts were curious to have ; but are not given in any
quantity : indeed few such remarkable men have been left so obscure to us
as this Titan of the Revolution . He was heard to ejaculate : &quot; This
time twelvemonth , I was moving the creation of that same Revolutionary
Tribunal . I crave pardon for it of God and man . They are all Brothers
Cain : Brissot would have had me guillotined as Robespierre now will . I
leave the whole business in a frightful welter ( gachis epouvantable ) :
not one of them understands anything of government . Robespierre will
follow me ; I drag down Robespierre . O , it were better to be a poor
fisherman than to meddle with governing of men . &quot; -- Camille &apos;s young
beautiful Wife , who had made him rich not in money alone , hovers round
the Luxembourg , like a disembodied spirit , day and night . Camille &apos;s
stolen letters to her still exist ; stained with the mark of his tears .
( Apercus sur Camille Desmoulins in Vieux Cordelier , Paris , 1825 , pp .
1 @-@ 29 . ) &quot; I carry my head like a Saint @-@ Sacrament ? &quot; so Saint @-@ Just was heard
to mutter : &quot; Perhaps he will carry his like a Saint @-@ Dennis . &quot;

Unhappy Danton , thou still unhappier light Camille , once light Procureur
de la Lanterne , ye also have arrived , then , at the Bourne of Creation ,
where , like Ulysses Polytlas at the limit and utmost Gades of his
voyage , gazing into that dim Waste beyond Creation , a man does see the
Shade of his Mother , pale , ineffectual ; -- and days when his Mother nursed
and wrapped him are all @-@ too sternly contrasted with this day ! Danton ,
Camille , Herault , Westermann , and the others , very strangely massed up
with Bazires , Swindler Chabots , Fabre d &apos;Eglantines , Banker Freys , a most
motley Batch , &apos; Fournee &apos; as such things will be called , stand ranked
at the Bar of Tinville . It is the 2d of April 1794 . Danton has had but
three days to lie in Prison ; for the time presses .

What is your name ? place of abode ? and the like , Fouquier asks ;
according to formality . &quot; My name is Danton , &quot; answers he ; &quot; a name
tolerably known in the Revolution : my abode will soon be Annihilation
( dans le Neant ) ; but I shall live in the Pantheon of History . &quot; A man
will endeavour to say something forcible , be it by nature or not !
Herault mentions epigrammatically that he &quot; sat in this Hall , and was
detested of Parlementeers . &quot; Camille makes answer , &quot; My age is that of
the bon Sansculotte Jesus ; an age fatal to Revolutionists . &quot; O Camille ,
Camille ! And yet in that Divine Transaction , let us say , there did lie ,
among other things , the fatallest Reproof ever uttered here below to
Worldly Right @-@ honourableness ; &apos; the highest Fact , &apos; so devout Novalis
calls it , &apos; in the Rights of Man . &apos; Camille &apos;s real age , it would seem , is
thirty @-@ four . Danton is one year older .

Some five months ago , the Trial of the Twenty @-@ two Girondins was the
greatest that Fouquier had then done . But here is a still greater to do ;
a thing which tasks the whole faculty of Fouquier ; which makes the very
heart of him waver . For it is the voice of Danton that reverberates
now from these domes ; in passionate words , piercing with their wild
sincerity , winged with wrath . Your best Witnesses he shivers into ruin
at one stroke . He demands that the Committee @-@ men themselves come as
Witnesses , as Accusers ; he &quot; will cover them with ignominy . &quot; He raises
his huge stature , he shakes his huge black head , fire flashes from
the eyes of him , -- piercing to all Republican hearts : so that the very
Galleries , though we filled them by ticket , murmur sympathy ; and are
like to burst down , and raise the People , and deliver him ! He complains
loudly that he is classed with Chabots , with swindling Stockjobbers ;
that his Indictment is a list of platitudes and horrors . &quot; Danton hidden
on the Tenth of August ? &quot; reverberates he , with the roar of a lion in the
toils : &quot; Where are the men that had to press Danton to shew himself , that
day ? Where are these high @-@ gifted souls of whom he borrowed energy ? Let
them appear , these Accusers of mine : I have all the clearness of my
self @-@ possession when I demand them . I will unmask the three shallow
scoundrels , &quot; les trois plats coquins , Saint @-@ Just , Couthon , Lebas , &quot; who
fawn on Robespierre , and lead him towards his destruction . Let them
produce themselves here ; I will plunge them into Nothingness , out of
which they ought never to have risen . &quot; The agitated President agitates
his bell ; enjoins calmness , in a vehement manner : &quot; What is it to thee
how I defend myself ? &quot; cries the other : &quot; the right of dooming me is thine
always . The voice of a man speaking for his honour and his life may well
drown the jingling of thy bell ! &quot; Thus Danton , higher and higher ; till
the lion voice of him &apos; dies away in his throat : &apos; speech will not utter
what is in that man . The Galleries murmur ominously ; the first day &apos;s
Session is over .

O Tinville , President Herman , what will ye do ? They have two days more
of it , by strictest Revolutionary Law . The Galleries already murmur .
If this Danton were to burst your mesh @-@ work ! -- Very curious indeed to
consider . It turns on a hair : and what a Hoitytoity were there , Justice
and Culprit changing places ; and the whole History of France running
changed ! For in France there is this Danton only that could still try
to govern France . He only , the wild amorphous Titan ; -- and perhaps that
other olive @-@ complexioned individual , the Artillery Officer at Toulon ,
whom we left pushing his fortune in the South ?

On the evening of the second day , matters looking not better but worse
and worse , Fouquier and Herman , distraction in their aspect , rush over
to Salut Public . What is to be done ? Salut Public rapidly concocts a new
Decree ; whereby if men &apos; insult Justice , &apos; they may be &apos; thrown out of the
Debates . &apos; For indeed , withal , is there not &apos; a Plot in the Luxembourg
Prison ? &apos; Ci @-@ devant General Dillon , and others of the Suspect , plotting
with Camille &apos;s Wife to distribute assignats ; to force the Prisons ,
overset the Republic ? Citizen Laflotte , himself Suspect but desiring
enfranchisement , has reported said Plot for us : -- a report that may bear
fruit ! Enough , on the morrow morning , an obedient Convention passes this
Decree . Salut rushes off with it to the aid of Tinville , reduced now
almost to extremities . And so , Hors des Debats , Out of the Debates ,
ye insolents ! Policemen do your duty ! In such manner , with a deadlift
effort , Salut , Tinville Herman , Leroi Dix @-@ Aout , and all stanch jurymen
setting heart and shoulder to it , the Jury becomes &apos; sufficiently
instructed ; &apos; Sentence is passed , is sent by an Official , and torn and
trampled on : Death this day . It is the 5th of April , 1794 . Camille &apos;s
poor Wife may cease hovering about this Prison . Nay let her kiss her
poor children ; and prepare to enter it , and to follow ! --

Danton carried a high look in the Death @-@ cart . Not so Camille : it is but
one week , and all is so topsy @-@ turvied ; angel Wife left weeping ; love ,
riches , Revolutionary fame , left all at the Prison @-@ gate ; carnivorous
Rabble now howling round . Palpable , and yet incredible ; like a madman &apos;s
dream ! Camille struggles and writhes ; his shoulders shuffle the loose
coat off them , which hangs knotted , the hands tied : &quot; Calm my friend , &quot;
said Danton ; &quot; heed not that vile canaille ( laissez la cette vile
canaille ) . &quot; At the foot of the Scaffold , Danton was heard to ejaculate :
&quot; O my Wife , my well @-@ beloved , I shall never see thee more
then ! &quot; -- but , interrupting himself : &quot; Danton , no weakness ! &quot; He said to
Herault @-@ Sechelles stepping forward to embrace him : &quot; Our heads will
meet there , &quot; in the Headsman &apos;s sack . His last words were to Samson the
Headsman himself : &quot; Thou wilt shew my head to the people ; it is worth
shewing . &quot;

So passes , like a gigantic mass , of valour , ostentation , fury , affection
and wild revolutionary manhood , this Danton , to his unknown home . He was
of Arcis @-@ sur @-@ Aube ; born of &apos; good farmer @-@ people &apos; there . He had many
sins ; but one worst sin he had not , that of Cant . No hollow Formalist ,
deceptive and self @-@ deceptive , ghastly to the natural sense , was this ;
but a very Man : with all his dross he was a Man ; fiery @-@ real , from the
great fire @-@ bosom of Nature herself . He saved France from Brunswick ; he
walked straight his own wild road , whither it led him . He may live for
some generations in the memory of men .



Chapter 3.6.III.

The Tumbrils .

Next week , it is still but the 10th of April , there comes a new
Nineteen ; Chaumette , Gobel , Hebert &apos;s Widow , the Widow of Camille : these
also roll their fated journey ; black Death devours them . Mean Hebert &apos;s
Widow was weeping , Camille &apos;s Widow tried to speak comfort to her . O
ye kind Heavens , azure , beautiful , eternal behind your tempests and
Time @-@ clouds , is there not pity for all ! Gobel , it seems , was repentant ;
he begged absolution of a Priest ; did as a Gobel best could . For
Anaxagoras Chaumette , the sleek head now stript of its bonnet rouge ,
what hope is there ? Unless Death were &apos; an eternal sleep ? &apos; Wretched
Anaxagoras , God shall judge thee , not I.

Hebert , therefore , is gone , and the Hebertists ; they that robbed
Churches , and adored blue Reason in red nightcap . Great Danton , and the
Dantonists ; they also are gone . Down to the catacombs ; they are become
silent men ! Let no Paris Municipality , no Sect or Party of this hue or
that , resist the will of Robespierre and Salut . Mayor Pache , not prompt
enough in denouncing these Pitts Plots , may congratulate about them
now . Never so heartily ; it skills not ! His course likewise is to the
Luxembourg . We appoint one Fleuriot @-@ Lescot Interim @-@ Mayor in his stead :
an &apos; architect from Belgium , &apos; they say , this Fleuriot ; he is a man one
can depend on . Our new Agent @-@ National is Payan , lately Juryman ; whose
cynosure also is Robespierre .

Thus then , we perceive , this confusedly electric Erebus @-@ cloud of
Revolutionary Government has altered its shape somewhat . Two masses , or
wings , belonging to it ; an over @-@ electric mass of Cordelier Rabids , and
an under @-@ electric of Dantonist Moderates and Clemency @-@ men , -- these two
masses , shooting bolts at one another , so to speak , have annihilated
one another . For the Erebus @-@ cloud , as we often remark , is of suicidal
nature ; and , in jagged irregularity , darts its lightning withal into
itself . But now these two discrepant masses being mutually annihilated ,
it is as if the Erebus @-@ cloud had got to internal composure ; and did only
pour its hellfire lightning on the World that lay under it . In plain
words , Terror of the Guillotine was never terrible till now . Systole ,
diastole , swift and ever swifter goes the Axe of Samson . Indictments
cease by degrees to have so much as plausibility : Fouquier chooses from
the Twelve houses of Arrest what he calls Batches , &apos; Fournees , &apos; a
score or more at a time ; his Jurymen are charged to make feu de file ,
fire @-@ filing till the ground be clear . Citizen Laflotte &apos;s report of Plot
in the Luxembourg is verily bearing fruit ! If no speakable charge exist
against a man , or Batch of men , Fouquier has always this : a Plot in the
Prison . Swift and ever swifter goes Samson ; up , finally , to three score
and more at a Batch ! It is the highday of Death : none but the Dead
return not .

O dusky d &apos;Espremenil , what a day is this , the 22d of April , thy last
day ! The Palais Hall here is the same stone Hall , where thou , five years
ago , stoodest perorating , amid endless pathos of rebellious Parlement ,
in the grey of the morning ; bound to march with d &apos;Agoust to the Isles
of Hieres . The stones are the same stones : but the rest , Men , Rebellion ,
Pathos , Peroration , see ! it has all fled , like a gibbering troop of
ghosts , like the phantasms of a dying brain ! With d &apos;Espremenil , in the
same line of Tumbrils , goes the mournfullest medley . Chapelier goes ,
ci @-@ devant popular President of the Constituent ; whom the Menads and
Maillard met in his carriage , on the Versailles Road . Thouret likewise ,
ci @-@ devant President , father of Constitutional Law @-@ acts ; he whom we heard
saying , long since , with a loud voice , &quot; The Constituent Assembly has
fulfilled its mission ! &quot; And the noble old Malesherbes , who defended
Louis and could not speak , like a grey old rock dissolving into sudden
water : he journeys here now , with his kindred , daughters , sons and
grandsons , his Lamoignons , Chateaubriands ; silent , towards Death . -- One
young Chateaubriand alone is wandering amid the Natchez , by the roar of
Niagara Falls , the moan of endless forests : Welcome thou great Nature ,
savage , but not false , not unkind , unmotherly ; no Formula thou , or rapid
jangle of Hypothesis , Parliamentary Eloquence , Constitution @-@ building and
the Guillotine ; speak thou to me , O Mother , and sing my sick heart thy
mystic everlasting lullaby @-@ song , and let all the rest be far ! --

Another row of Tumbrils we must notice : that which holds Elizabeth , the
Sister of Louis . Her Trial was like the rest ; for Plots , for Plots . She
was among the kindliest , most innocent of women . There sat with her ,
amid four @-@ and @-@ twenty others , a once timorous Marchioness de Crussol ;
courageous now ; expressing towards her the liveliest loyalty . At the
foot of the Scaffold , Elizabeth with tears in her eyes , thanked this
Marchioness ; said she was grieved she could not reward her . &quot; Ah ,
Madame , would your Royal Highness deign to embrace me , my wishes were
complete ! &quot; -- &quot; Right willingly , Marquise de Crussol , and with my whole
heart . &quot; ( Montgaillard , iv . 200 . ) Thus they : at the foot of the Scaffold .
The Royal Family is now reduced to two : a girl and a little boy . The
boy , once named Dauphin , was taken from his Mother while she yet lived ;
and given to one Simon , by trade a Cordwainer , on service then about
the Temple @-@ Prison , to bring him up in principles of Sansculottism . Simon
taught him to drink , to swear , to sing the carmagnole . Simon is now gone
to the Municipality : and the poor boy , hidden in a tower of the Temple ,
from which in his fright and bewilderment and early decrepitude he
wishes not to stir out , lies perishing , &apos; his shirt not changed for six
months ; &apos; amid squalor and darkness , lamentably , ( Duchesse d &apos;Angouleme ,
Captivite a la Tour du Temple , pp. 37 @-@ 71 . ) -- so as none but poor Factory
Children and the like are wont to perish , unlamented !

The Spring sends its green leaves and bright weather , bright May
brighter than ever : Death pauses not . Lavoisier famed Chemist , shall die
and not live : Chemist Lavoisier was Farmer @-@ General Lavoisier too , and
now &apos; all the Farmers @-@ General are arrested ; &apos; all , and shall give an
account of their monies and incomings ; and die for &apos; putting water in the
tobacco &apos; they sold . ( Tribunal Revolutionnaire , du 8 Mai 1794 , Moniteur ,
No. 231 . ) Lavoisier begged a fortnight more of life , to finish some
experiments : but &quot; the Republic does not need such ; &quot; the axe must do
its work . Cynic Chamfort , reading these Inscriptions of Brotherhood or
Death , says &quot; it is a Brotherhood of Cain : &quot; arrested , then liberated ;
then about to be arrested again , this Chamfort cuts and slashes himself
with frantic uncertain hand ; gains , not without difficulty , the refuge
of death . Condorcet has lurked deep , these many months ; Argus @-@ eyes
watching and searching for him . His concealment is become dangerous
to others and himself ; he has to fly again , to skulk , round Paris ,
in thickets and stone @-@ quarries . And so at the Village of Clamars , one
bleared May morning , there enters a Figure , ragged , rough @-@ bearded ,
hunger @-@ stricken ; asks breakfast in the tavern there . Suspect , by the
look of him ! &quot; Servant out of place , sayest thou ? &quot; Committee @-@ President
of Forty @-@ Sous finds a Latin Horace on him : &quot; Art thou not one of those
Ci @-@ devants that were wont to keep servants ? Suspect ! &quot; He is haled
forthwith , breakfast unfinished , towards Bourg @-@ la @-@ Reine , on foot : he
faints with exhaustion ; is set on a peasant &apos;s horse ; is flung into his
damp prison @-@ cell : on the morrow , recollecting him , you enter ; Condorcet
lies dead on the floor . They die fast , and disappear : the Notabilities
of France disappear , one after one , like lights in a Theatre , which you
are snuffing out .

Under which circumstances , is it not singular , and almost touching , to
see Paris City drawn out , in the meek May nights , in civic ceremony ,
which they call &apos; Souper Fraternel , Brotherly Supper ? Spontaneous , or
partially spontaneous , in the twelfth , thirteenth , fourteenth nights of
this May month , it is seen . Along the Rue Saint @-@ Honore , and main Streets
and Spaces , each Citoyen brings forth what of supper the stingy Maximum
has yielded him , to the open air ; joins it to his neighbour &apos;s supper ;
and with common table , cheerful light burning frequent , and what due
modicum of cut @-@ glasses and other garnish and relish is convenient , they
eat frugally together , under the kind stars . ( Tableaux de la Revolution ,
para Soupers Fraternels ; Mercier , ii . 150 . ) See it O Night ! With
cheerfully pledged wine @-@ cup , hobnobbing to the Reign of Liberty ,
Equality , Brotherhood , with their wives in best ribands , with their
little ones romping round , the Citoyens , in frugal Love @-@ feast , sit
there . Night in her wide empire sees nothing similar . O my brothers , why
is the reign of Brotherhood not come ! It is come , it shall come , say the
Citoyens frugally hobnobbing . -- Ah me ! these everlasting stars , do they
not look down &apos; like glistening eyes , bright with immortal pity , over the
lot of man ! &apos; --

One lamentable thing , however , is , that individuals will attempt
assassination -- of Representatives of the People . Representative Collot ,
Member even of Salut , returning home , &apos; about one in the morning , &apos;
probably touched with liquor , as he is apt to be , meets on the stairs ,
the cry &quot; Scelerat ! &quot; and also the snap of a pistol : which latter
flashes in the pan ; disclosing to him , momentarily , a pair of truculent
saucer @-@ eyes , swart grim @-@ clenched countenance ; recognisable as that
of our little fellow @-@ lodger , Citoyen Amiral , formerly &apos; a clerk in the
Lotteries ! ; Collot shouts Murder , with lungs fit to awaken all the Rue
Favart ; Amiral snaps a second time ; a second time flashes in the pan ;
then darts up into his apartment ; and , after there firing , still with
inadequate effect , one musket at himself and another at his captor ,
is clutched and locked in Prison . ( Riouffe , p . 73 ; Deux Amis , xii .
298 @-@ 302 . ) An indignant little man this Amiral , of Southern temper and
complexion , of &apos; considerable muscular force . &apos; He denies not that he
meant to &quot; purge France of a tyrant ; &quot; nay avows that he had an eye to the
Incorruptible himself , but took Collot as more convenient !

Rumour enough hereupon ; heaven @-@ high congratulation of Collot , fraternal
embracing , at the Jacobins , and elsewhere . And yet , it would seem the
assassin @-@ mood proves catching . Two days more , it is still but the 23d
of May , and towards nine in the evening , Cecile Renault , Paper @-@ dealer &apos;s
daughter , a young woman of soft blooming look , presents herself at the
Cabinet @-@ maker &apos;s in the Rue Saint @-@ Honore ; desires to see Robespierre .
Robespierre cannot be seen : she grumbles irreverently . They lay hold of
her . She has left a basket in a shop hard by : in the basket are female
change of raiment and two knives ! Poor Cecile , examined by Committee ,
declares she &quot; wanted to see what a tyrant was like : &quot; the change of
raiment was &quot; for my own use in the place I am surely going to . &quot; -- &quot; What
place ? &quot; -- &quot; Prison ; and then the Guillotine , &quot; answered she . -- Such things
come of Charlotte Corday ; in a people prone to imitation , and monomania !
Swart choleric men try Charlotte &apos;s feat , and their pistols miss fire ;
soft blooming young women try it , and , only half @-@ resolute , leave their
knives in a shop .

O Pitt , and ye Faction of the Stranger , shall the Republic never have
rest ; but be torn continually by baited springs , by wires of explosive
spring @-@ guns ? Swart Amiral , fair young Cecile , and all that knew them ,
and many that did not know them , lie locked , waiting the scrutiny of
Tinville .



Chapter 3.6.IV.

Mumbo @-@ Jumbo .

But on the day they call Decadi , New @-@ Sabbath , 20 Prairial , 8th June by
old style , what thing is this going forward , in the Jardin National ,
whilom Tuileries Garden ?

All the world is there , in holydays clothes : ( Vilate , Causes Secretes de
la Revolution de 9 Thermidor . ) foul linen went out with the Hebertists ;
nay Robespierre , for one , would never once countenance that ; but went
always elegant and frizzled , not without vanity even , -- and had his room
hung round with seagreen Portraits and Busts . In holyday clothes , we
say , are the innumerable Citoyens and Citoyennes : the weather is of the
brightest ; cheerful expectation lights all countenances . Juryman Vilate
gives breakfast to many a Deputy , in his official Apartment , in the
Pavillon ci @-@ devant of Flora ; rejoices in the bright @-@ looking multitudes ,
in the brightness of leafy June , in the auspicious Decadi , or
New @-@ Sabbath . This day , if it please Heaven , we are to have , on improved
Anti @-@ Chaumette principles : a New Religion .

Catholicism being burned out , and Reason @-@ worship guillotined , was there
not need of one ? Incorruptible Robespierre , not unlike the Ancients , as
Legislator of a free people will now also be Priest and Prophet . He has
donned his sky @-@ blue coat , made for the occasion ; white silk waistcoat
broidered with silver , black silk breeches , white stockings ,
shoe @-@ buckles of gold . He is President of the Convention ; he has made
the Convention decree , so they name it , decreter the &apos; Existence of the
Supreme Being , &apos; and likewise &apos; ce principe consolateur of the Immortality
of the Soul . &apos; These consolatory principles , the basis of rational
Republican Religion , are getting decreed ; and here , on this blessed
Decadi , by help of Heaven and Painter David , is to be our first act of
worship .

See , accordingly , how after Decree passed , and what has been called
&apos;the scraggiest Prophetic Discourse ever uttered by man , &apos; -- Mahomet
Robespierre , in sky @-@ blue coat and black breeches , frizzled and powdered
to perfection , bearing in his hand a bouquet of flowers and wheat @-@ ears ,
issues proudly from the Convention Hall ; Convention following him , yet ,
as is remarked , with an interval . Amphitheatre has been raised , or at
least Monticule or Elevation ; hideous Statues of Atheism , Anarchy and
such like , thanks to Heaven and Painter David , strike abhorrence into
the heart . Unluckily however , our Monticule is too small . On the top of
it not half of us can stand ; wherefore there arises indecent shoving ,
nay treasonous irreverent growling . Peace , thou Bourdon de l &apos;Oise ;
peace , or it may be worse for thee !

The seagreen Pontiff takes a torch , Painter David handing it ; mouths
some other froth @-@ rant of vocables , which happily one cannot hear ;
strides resolutely forward , in sight of expectant France ; sets his torch
to Atheism and Company , which are but made of pasteboard steeped in
turpentine . They burn up rapidly ; and , from within , there rises &apos; by
machinery &apos; an incombustible Statue of Wisdom , which , by ill hap , gets
besmoked a little ; but does stand there visible in as serene attitude as
it can .

And then ? Why , then , there is other Processioning , scraggy Discoursing ,
and -- this is our Feast of the Etre Supreme ; our new Religion , better or
worse , is come ! -- Look at it one moment , O Reader , not two . The Shabbiest
page of Human Annals : or is there , that thou wottest of , one shabbier ?
Mumbo @-@ Jumbo of the African woods to me seems venerable beside this new
Deity of Robespierre ; for this is a conscious Mumbo @-@ Jumbo , and knows
that he is machinery . O seagreen Prophet , unhappiest of windbags blown
nigh to bursting , what distracted Chimera among realities are thou
growing to ! This then , this common pitch @-@ link for artificial fireworks
of turpentine and pasteboard ; this is the miraculous Aaron &apos;s Rod thou
wilt stretch over a hag @-@ ridden hell @-@ ridden France , and bid her plagues
cease ? Vanish , thou and it ! -- &quot; Avec ton Etre Supreme , &quot; said Billaud , &quot; tu
commences m &apos;embeter : With thy Etre Supreme thou beginnest to be a
bore to me . &quot; ( See Vilate , Causes Secretes . Vilate &apos;s Narrative is very
curious ; but is not to be taken as true , without sifting ; being , at
bottom , in spite of its title , not a Narrative but a Pleading . )

Catherine Theot , on the other hand , &apos; an ancient serving @-@ maid
seventy @-@ nine years of age , &apos; inured to Prophecy and the Bastille from of
old , sits , in an upper room in the Rue @-@ de @-@ Contrescarpe , poring over
the Book of Revelations , with an eye to Robespierre ; finds that this
astonishing thrice @-@ potent Maximilien really is the Man spoken of by
Prophets , who is to make the Earth young again . With her sit devout old
Marchionesses , ci @-@ devant honourable women ; among whom Old @-@ Constituent
Dom Gerle , with his addle head , cannot be wanting . They sit there , in
the Rue @-@ de @-@ Contrescarpe ; in mysterious adoration : Mumbo is Mumbo , and
Robespierre is his Prophet . A conspicuous man this Robespierre . He has
his volunteer Bodyguard of Tappe @-@ durs , let us say Strike @-@ sharps , fierce
Patriots with feruled sticks ; and Jacobins kissing the hem of his
garment . He enjoys the admiration of many , the worship of some ; and is
well worth the wonder of one and all .

The grand question and hope , however , is : Will not this Feast of the
Tuileries Mumbo @-@ Jumbo be a sign perhaps that the Guillotine is to abate ?
Far enough from that ! Precisely on the second day after it , Couthon , one
of the &apos; three shallow scoundrels , &apos; gets himself lifted into the Tribune ;
produces a bundle of papers . Couthon proposes that , as Plots still
abound , the Law of the Suspect shall have extension , and Arrestment new
vigour and facility . Further that , as in such case business is like
to be heavy , our Revolutionary Tribunal too shall have extension ; be
divided , say , into Four Tribunals , each with its President , each with
its Fouquier or Substitute of Fouquier , all labouring at once , and any
remnant of shackle or dilatory formality be struck off : in this way it
may perhaps still overtake the work . Such is Couthon &apos;s Decree of the
Twenty @-@ second Prairial , famed in those times . At hearing of which Decree
the very Mountain gasped , awestruck ; and one Ruamps ventured to say
that if it passed without adjournment and discussion , he , as one
Representative , &quot; would blow his brains out . &quot; Vain saying ! The
Incorruptible knit his brows ; spoke a prophetic fateful word or two : the
Law of Prairial is Law ; Ruamps glad to leave his rash brains where they
are . Death , then , and always Death ! Even so . Fouquier is enlarging
his borders ; making room for Batches of a Hundred and fifty at
once ; -- getting a Guillotine set up , of improved velocity , and to work
under cover , in the apartment close by . So that Salut itself has to
intervene , and forbid him : &quot; Wilt thou demoralise the Guillotine , &quot; asks
Collot , reproachfully , &quot; demoraliser le supplice ! &quot;

There is indeed danger of that ; were not the Republican faith great , it
were already done . See , for example , on the 17th of June , what a Batch ,
Fifty @-@ four at once ! Swart Amiral is here , he of the pistol that missed
fire ; young Cecile Renault , with her father , family , entire kith and
kin ; the widow of d &apos;Espremenil ; old M. de Sombreuil of the Invalides ,
with his Son , -- poor old Sombreuil , seventy @-@ three years old , his
Daughter saved him in September , and it was but for this . Faction of the
Stranger , fifty @-@ four of them ! In red shirts and smocks , as Assassins
and Faction of the Stranger , they flit along there ; red baleful
Phantasmagory , towards the land of Phantoms .

Meanwhile will not the people of the Place de la Revolution , the
inhabitants along the Rue Saint @-@ Honore , as these continual Tumbrils
pass , begin to look gloomy ? Republicans too have bowels . The Guillotine
is shifted , then again shifted ; finally set up at the remote extremity
of the South @-@ East : ( Montgaillard , iv . 237 . ) Suburbs Saint @-@ Antoine and
Saint @-@ Marceau it is to be hoped , if they have bowels , have very tough
ones .




Chapter 3.6.V.

The Prisons .

It is time now , however , to cast a glance into the Prisons . When
Desmoulins moved for his Committee of Mercy , these Twelve Houses of
Arrest held five thousand persons . Continually arriving since then ,
there have now accumulated twelve thousand . They are Ci @-@ devants ,
Royalists ; in far greater part , they are Republicans , of various
Girondin , Fayettish , Un @-@ Jacobin colour . Perhaps no human Habitation or
Prison ever equalled in squalor , in noisome horror , these Twelve Houses
of Arrest . There exist records of personal experience in them Memoires
sur les Prisons ; one of the strangest Chapters in the Biography of Man .

Very singular to look into it : how a kind of order rises up in all
conditions of human existence ; and wherever two or three are gathered
together , there are formed modes of existing together , habitudes ,
observances , nay gracefulnesses , joys ! Citoyen Coitant will explain
fully how our lean dinner , of herbs and carrion , was consumed not
without politeness and place @-@ aux @-@ dames : how Seigneur and Shoeblack ,
Duchess and Doll @-@ Tearsheet , flung pellmell into a heap , ranked
themselves according to method : at what hour &apos; the Citoyennes took to
their needlework ; &apos; and we , yielding the chairs to them , endeavoured to
talk gallantly in a standing posture , or even to sing and harp more
or less . Jealousies , enmities are not wanting ; nor flirtations , of an
effective character .

Alas , by degrees , even needlework must cease : Plot in the Prison rises ,
by Citoyen Laflotte and Preternatural Suspicion . Suspicious Municipality
snatches from us all implements ; all money and possession , of means or
metal , is ruthlessly searched for , in pocket , in pillow and paillasse ,
and snatched away ; red @-@ capped Commissaries entering every cell !
Indignation , temporary desperation , at robbery of its very thimble ,
fills the gentle heart . Old Nuns shriek shrill discord ; demand to be
killed forthwith . No help from shrieking ! Better was that of the two
shifty male Citizens , who , eager to preserve an implement or two , were
it but a pipe @-@ picker , or needle to darn hose with , determined to defend
themselves : by tobacco . Swift then , as your fell Red Caps are heard in
the Corridor rummaging and slamming , the two Citoyens light their pipes
and begin smoking . Thick darkness envelops them . The Red Nightcaps ,
opening the cell , breathe but one mouthful ; burst forth into chorus
of barking and coughing . &quot; Quoi , Messieurs , &quot; cry the two Citoyens , &quot; You
don &apos;t smoke ? Is the pipe disagreeable ! Est @-@ ce que vous ne fumez pas ? &quot;
But the Red Nightcaps have fled , with slight search : &quot; Vous n &apos;aimez
pas la pipe ? &quot; cry the Citoyens , as their door slams @-@ to again . ( Maison
d &apos;Arret de Port @-@ Libre , par Coittant , &amp; c . Memoires sur les Prisons , ii . )
My poor brother Citoyens , O surely , in a reign of Brotherhood , you are
not the two I would guillotine !

Rigour grows , stiffens into horrid tyranny ; Plot in the Prison getting
ever riper . This Plot in the Prison , as we said , is now the stereotype
formula of Tinville : against whomsoever he knows no crime , this is a
ready @-@ made crime . His Judgment @-@ bar has become unspeakable ; a recognised
mockery ; known only as the wicket one passes through , towards Death . His
Indictments are drawn out in blank ; you insert the Names after . He has
his moutons , detestable traitor jackalls , who report and bear witness ;
that they themselves may be allowed to live , -- for a time . His Fournees ,
says the reproachful Collot , &apos; shall in no case exceed three @-@ score ; &apos; that
is his maximum . Nightly come his Tumbrils to the Luxembourg , with the
fatal Roll @-@ call ; list of the Fournee of to @-@ morrow . Men rush towards the
Grate ; listen , if their name be in it ? One deep @-@ drawn breath , when the
name is not in : we live still one day ! And yet some score or scores of
names were in . Quick these ; they clasp their loved ones to their heart ,
one last time ; with brief adieu , wet @-@ eyed or dry @-@ eyed , they mount , and
are away . This night to the Conciergerie ; through the Palais misnamed of
Justice , to the Guillotine to @-@ morrow .

Recklessness , defiant levity , the Stoicism if not of strength yet of
weakness , has possessed all hearts . Weak women and Ci @-@ devants , their
locks not yet made into blond perukes , their skins not yet tanned into
breeches , are accustomed to &apos; act the Guillotine &apos; by way of pastime . In
fantastic mummery , with towel @-@ turbans , blanket @-@ ermine , a mock Sanhedrim
of Judges sits , a mock Tinville pleads ; a culprit is doomed , is
guillotined by the oversetting of two chairs . Sometimes we carry it
farther : Tinville himself , in his turn , is doomed , and not to the
Guillotine alone . With blackened face , hirsute , horned , a shaggy Satan
snatches him not unshrieking ; shews him , with outstretched arm and
voice , the fire that is not quenched , the worm that dies not ; the
monotony of Hell @-@ pain , and the What hour ? answered by , It is Eternity !
( Montgaillard , iv . 218 ; Riouffe , p . 273 . )

And still the Prisons fill fuller , and still the Guillotine goes faster .
On all high roads march flights of Prisoners , wending towards Paris .
Not Ci @-@ devants now ; they , the noisy of them , are mown down ; it is
Republicans now . Chained two and two they march ; in exasperated moments ,
singing their Marseillaise . A hundred and thirty @-@ two men of Nantes for
instance , march towards Paris , in these same days : Republicans , or
say even Jacobins to the marrow of the bone ; but Jacobins who had not
approved Noyading . ( Voyage de Cent Trente @-@ deux Nantais , Prisons , ii .
288 @-@ 335 . ) Vive la Republique rises from them in all streets of towns :
they rest by night , in unutterable noisome dens , crowded to choking ; one
or two dead on the morrow . They are wayworn , weary of heart ; can only
shout : Live the Republic ; we , as under horrid enchantment , dying in this
way for it !

Some Four Hundred Priests , of whom also there is record , ride at anchor ,
&apos;in the roads of the Isle of Aix , &apos; long months ; looking out on misery ,
vacuity , waste Sands of Oleron and the ever @-@ moaning brine . Ragged ,
sordid , hungry ; wasted to shadows : eating their unclean ration on deck ,
circularly , in parties of a dozen , with finger and thumb ; beating their
scandalous clothes between two stones ; choked in horrible miasmata ,
closed under hatches , seventy of them in a berth , through night ; so that
the &apos; aged Priest is found lying dead in the morning , in the attitude of
prayer ! &apos; ( Relation de ce qu &apos;ont souffert pour la Religion les
Pretres deportes en 1794 , dans la rade de l &apos;ile d &apos;Aix , Prisons , ii .
387 @-@ 485 . ) -- How long , O Lord !

Not forever ; no . All Anarchy , all Evil , Injustice , is , by the nature of
it , dragon &apos;s @-@ teeth ; suicidal , and cannot endure .



Chapter 3.6.VI.

To finish the Terror .

It is very remarkable , indeed , that since the Etre @-@ Supreme Feast , and
the sublime continued harangues on it , which Billaud feared would
become a bore to him , Robespierre has gone little to Committee ; but held
himself apart , as if in a kind of pet . Nay they have made a Report on
that old Catherine Theot , and her Regenerative Man spoken of by the
Prophets ; not in the best spirit . This Theot mystery they affect to
regard as a Plot ; but have evidently introduced a vein of satire , of
irreverent banter , not against the Spinster alone , but obliquely against
her Regenerative Man ! Barrere &apos;s light pen was perhaps at the bottom of
it : read through the solemn snuffling organs of old Vadier of the
Surete Generale , the Theot Report had its effect ; wrinkling the general
Republican visage into an iron grin . Ought these things to be ?

We note further that among the Prisoners in the Twelve Houses of Arrest ,
there is one whom we have seen before . Senhora Fontenai , born Cabarus ,
the fair Proserpine whom Representative Tallien Pluto @-@ like did gather
at Bourdeaux , not without effect on himself ! Tallien is home , by recall ,
long since , from Bourdeaux ; and in the most alarming position . Vain that
he sounded , louder even than ever , the note of Jacobinism , to hide past
shortcomings : the Jacobins purged him out ; two times has Robespierre
growled at him words of omen from the Convention Tribune . And now his
fair Cabarus , hit by denunciation , lies Arrested , Suspect , in spite of
all he could do ! -- Shut in horrid pinfold of death , the Senhora
smuggles out to her red @-@ gloomy Tallien the most pressing entreaties and
conjurings : Save me ; save thyself . Seest thou not that thy own head is
doomed ; thou with a too fiery audacity ; a Dantonist withal ; against whom
lie grudges ? Are ye not all doomed , as in the Polyphemus Cavern ; the
fawningest slave of you will be but eaten last ! -- Tallien feels with a
shudder that it is true . Tallien has had words of omen , Bourdon has had
words , Freron is hated and Barras : each man &apos; feels his head if it yet
stick on his shoulders . &apos; 

Meanwhile Robespierre , we still observe , goes little to Convention ,
not at all to Committee ; speaks nothing except to his Jacobin House of
Lords , amid his bodyguard of Tappe @-@ durs . These &apos; forty @-@ days , &apos; for we are
now far in July , he has not shewed face in Committee ; could only work
there by his three shallow scoundrels , and the terror there was of him .
The Incorruptible himself sits apart ; or is seen stalking in solitary
places in the fields , with an intensely meditative air ; some say , &apos; with
eyes red @-@ spotted , &apos; ( Deux Amis , xii . 347 @-@ 73 . ) fruit of extreme bile : the
lamentablest seagreen Chimera that walks the Earth that July ! O hapless
Chimera ; for thou too hadst a life , and a heart of flesh , -- what is this
the stern gods , seeming to smile all the way , have led and let thee to !
Art not thou he who , few years ago , was a young Advocate of promise ; and
gave up the Arras Judgeship rather than sentence one man to die ? --

What his thoughts might be ? His plans for finishing the Terror ? One
knows not . Dim vestiges there flit of Agrarian Law ; a victorious
Sansculottism become Landed Proprietor ; old Soldiers sitting in National
Mansions , in Hospital Palaces of Chambord and Chantilly ; peace bought by
victory ; breaches healed by Feast of Etre Supreme ; -- and so , through seas
of blood , to Equality , Frugality , worksome Blessedness , Fraternity ,
and Republic of the virtues ! Blessed shore , of such a sea of Aristocrat
blood : but how to land on it ? Through one last wave : blood of corrupt
Sansculottists ; traitorous or semi @-@ traitorous Conventionals , rebellious
Talliens , Billauds , to whom with my Etre Supreme I have become a bore ;
with my Apocalyptic Old Woman a laughing @-@ stock ! -- So stalks he , this poor
Robespierre , like a seagreen ghost through the blooming July . Vestiges
of schemes flit dim . But what his schemes or his thoughts were will
never be known to man .

New Catacombs , some say , are digging for a huge simultaneous butchery .
Convention to be butchered , down to the right pitch , by General Henriot
and Company : Jacobin House of Lords made dominant ; and Robespierre
Dictator . ( Deux Amis , xii . 350 @-@ 8 . ) There is actually , or else there is
not actually , a List made out ; which the Hairdresser has got eye on , as
he frizzled the Incorruptible locks . Each man asks himself , Is it I ?

Nay , as Tradition and rumour of Anecdote still convey it , there was a
remarkable bachelor &apos;s dinner one hot day at Barrere &apos;s . For doubt not , O
Reader , this Barrere and others of them gave dinners ; had &apos; country @-@ house
at Clichy , &apos; with elegant enough sumptuosities , and pleasures
high @-@ rouged ! ( See Vilate . ) But at this dinner we speak of , the day being
so hot , it is said , the guests all stript their coats , and left them in
the drawing @-@ room : whereupon Carnot glided out ; groped in Robespierre &apos;s
pocket ; found a list of Forty , his own name among them ; and tarried not
at the wine @-@ cup that day ! -- Ye must bestir yourselves , O Friends ; ye dull
Frogs of the Marsh , mute ever since Girondism sank under , even ye now
must croak or die ! Councils are held , with word and beck ; nocturnal ,
mysterious as death . Does not a feline Maximilien stalk there ; voiceless
as yet ; his green eyes red @-@ spotted ; back bent , and hair up ? Rash
Tallien , with his rash temper and audacity of tongue ; he shall bell the
cat . Fix a day ; and be it soon , lest never !

Lo , before the fixed day , on the day which they call Eighth of
Thermidor , 26th July 1794 , Robespierre himself reappears in Convention ;
mounts to the Tribune ! The biliary face seems clouded with new gloom ;
judge whether your Talliens , Bourdons listened with interest . It is
a voice bodeful of death or of life . Long @-@ winded , unmelodious as the
screech @-@ owl &apos;s , sounds that prophetic voice : Degenerate condition
of Republican spirit ; corrupt moderatism ; Surete , Salut Committees
themselves infected ; back @-@ sliding on this hand and on that ; I ,
Maximilien , alone left incorruptible , ready to die at a moment &apos;s
warning . For all which what remedy is there ? The Guillotine ; new vigour
to the all @-@ healing Guillotine : death to traitors of every hue ! So sings
the prophetic voice ; into its Convention sounding @-@ board . The old song
this : but to @-@ day , O Heavens ! has the sounding @-@ board ceased to act ? There
is not resonance in this Convention ; there is , so to speak , a gasp of
silence ; nay a certain grating of one knows not what ! -- Lecointre , our
old Draper of Versailles , in these questionable circumstances , sees
nothing he can do so safe as rise , &apos; insidiously &apos; or not insidiously ,
and move , according to established wont , that the Robespierre Speech
be &apos; printed and sent to the Departments . &apos; Hark : gratings , even of
dissonance ! Honourable Members hint dissonance ; Committee @-@ Members ,
inculpated in the Speech , utter dissonance ; demand &apos; delay in printing . &apos; 
Ever higher rises the note of dissonance ; inquiry is even made by Editor
Freron : &quot; What has become of the Liberty of Opinions in this Convention ? &quot;
The Order to print and transmit , which had got passed , is rescinded .
Robespierre , greener than ever before , has to retire , foiled ; discerning
that it is mutiny , that evil is nigh .

Mutiny is a thing of the fatallest nature in all enterprises whatsoever ;
a thing so incalculable , swift @-@ frightful ; not to be dealt with in
fright . But mutiny in a Robespierre Convention , above all , -- it is like
fire seen sputtering in the ship &apos;s powder @-@ room ! One death @-@ defiant plunge
at it , this moment , and you may still tread it out : hesitate till next
moment , -- ship and ship &apos;s captain , crew and cargo are shivered far ; the
ship &apos;s voyage has suddenly ended between sea and sky . If Robespierre
can , to @-@ night , produce his Henriot and Company , and get his work done by
them , he and Sansculottism may still subsist some time ; if not , probably
not . Oliver Cromwell , when that Agitator Serjeant stept forth from
the ranks , with plea of grievances , and began gesticulating
and demonstrating , as the mouthpiece of Thousands expectant
there , -- discerned , with those truculent eyes of his , how the matter
lay ; plucked a pistol from his holsters ; blew Agitator and Agitation
instantly out . Noll was a man fit for such things .

Robespierre , for his part , glides over at evening to his Jacobin House
of Lords ; unfolds there , instead of some adequate resolution , his woes ,
his uncommon virtues , incorruptibilities ; then , secondly , his rejected
screech @-@ owl Oration ; -- reads this latter over again ; and declares that
he is ready to die at a moment &apos;s warning . Thou shalt not die ! shouts
Jacobinism from its thousand throats . &quot; Robespierre , I will drink the
hemlock with thee , &quot; cries Painter David , &quot; Je boirai la cigue avec
toi ; &quot; -- a thing not essential to do , but which , in the fire of the
moment , can be said .

Our Jacobin sounding @-@ board , therefore , does act ! Applauses heaven @-@ high
cover the rejected Oration ; fire @-@ eyed fury lights all Jacobin features :
Insurrection a sacred duty ; the Convention to be purged ; Sovereign
People under Henriot and Municipality ; we will make a new June @-@ Second
of it : to your tents , O Israel ! In this key pipes Jacobinism ; in sheer
tumult of revolt . Let Tallien and all Opposition men make off . Collot
d &apos;Herbois , though of the supreme Salut , and so lately near shot , is
elbowed , bullied ; is glad to escape alive . Entering Committee @-@ room of
Salut , all dishevelled , he finds sleek sombre Saint @-@ Just there ,
among the rest ; who in his sleek way asks , &quot; What is passing at the
Jacobins ? &quot; -- &quot; What is passing ? &quot; repeats Collot , in the unhistrionic
Cambyses &apos; vein : &quot; What is passing ? Nothing but revolt and horrors are
passing . Ye want our lives ; ye shall not have them . &quot; Saint @-@ Just stutters
at such Cambyses &apos; -oratory ; takes his hat to withdraw . That report he
had been speaking of , Report on Republican Things in General we may say ,
which is to be read in Convention on the morrow , he cannot shew it them
this moment : a friend has it ; he , Saint @-@ Just , will get it , and send it ,
were he once home . Once home , he sends not it , but an answer that he
will not send it ; that they will hear it from the Tribune to @-@ morrow .

Let every man , therefore , according to a well @-@ known good @-@ advice , &apos; pray
to Heaven , and keep his powder dry ! &apos; Paris , on the morrow , will see a
thing . Swift scouts fly dim or invisible , all night , from Surete and
Salut ; from conclave to conclave ; from Mother Society to Townhall .
Sleep , can it fall on the eyes of Talliens , Frerons , Collots ? Puissant
Henriot , Mayor Fleuriot , Judge Coffinhal , Procureur Payan , Robespierre
and all the Jacobins are getting ready .



Chapter 3.6.VII.

Go down to .

Tallien &apos;s eyes beamed bright , on the morrow , Ninth of Thermidor &apos; about
nine o &apos;clock , &apos; to see that the Convention had actually met . Paris is in
rumour : but at least we are met , in Legal Convention here ; we have
not been snatched seriatim ; treated with a Pride &apos;s Purge at the door .
&quot; Allons , brave men of the Plain , &quot; late Frogs of the Marsh ! cried Tallien
with a squeeze of the hand , as he passed in ; Saint @-@ Just &apos;s sonorous organ
being now audible from the Tribune , and the game of games begun .

Saint @-@ Just is verily reading that Report of his ; green Vengeance , in
the shape of Robespierre , watching nigh . Behold , however , Saint @-@ Just has
read but few sentences , when interruption rises , rapid crescendo ;
when Tallien starts to his feet , and Billaud , and this man starts and
that , -- and Tallien , a second time , with his : &quot; Citoyens , at the Jacobins
last night , I trembled for the Republic . I said to myself , if the
Convention dare not strike the Tyrant , then I myself dare ; and with
this I will do it , if need be , &quot; said he , whisking out a clear @-@ gleaming
Dagger , and brandishing it there : the Steel of Brutus , as we call
it . Whereat we all bellow , and brandish , impetuous acclaim . &quot; Tyranny ;
Dictatorship ! Triumvirat ! &quot; And the Salut Committee @-@ men accuse , and
all men accuse , and uproar , and impetuously acclaim . And Saint @-@ Just is
standing motionless , pale of face ; Couthon ejaculating , &quot; Triumvir ? &quot; with
a look at his paralytic legs . And Robespierre is struggling to speak ,
but President Thuriot is jingling the bell against him , but the Hall is
sounding against him like an Aeolus @-@ Hall : and Robespierre is mounting
the Tribune @-@ steps and descending again ; going and coming , like to choke
with rage , terror , desperation : -- and mutiny is the order of the day !
( Moniteur , Nos. 311 , 312 ; Debats , iv . 421 @-@ 42 ; Deux Amis , xii . 390 @-@ 411 . )

O President Thuriot , thou that wert Elector Thuriot , and from the
Bastille battlements sawest Saint @-@ Antoine rising like the Ocean @-@ tide ,
and hast seen much since , sawest thou ever the like of this ? Jingle of
bell , which thou jinglest against Robespierre , is hardly audible amid
the Bedlam @-@ storm ; and men rage for life . &quot; President of Assassins , &quot;
shrieks Robespierre , &quot; I demand speech of thee for the last time ! &quot; It
cannot be had . &quot; To you , O virtuous men of the Plain , &quot; cries he , finding
audience one moment , &quot; I appeal to you ! &quot; The virtuous men of the Plain
sit silent as stones . And Thuriot &apos;s bell jingles , and the Hall sounds
like Aeolus &apos;s Hall . Robespierre &apos;s frothing lips are grown &apos; blue ; &apos; his
tongue dry , cleaving to the roof of his mouth . &quot; The blood of Danton
chokes him , &quot; cry they . &quot; Accusation ! Decree of Accusation ! &quot; Thuriot
swiftly puts that question . Accusation passes ; the incorruptible
Maximilien is decreed Accused .

&quot; I demand to share my Brother &apos;s fate , as I have striven to share his
virtues , &quot; cries Augustin , the Younger Robespierre : Augustin also is
decreed . And Couthon , and Saint @-@ Just , and Lebas , they are all decreed ;
and packed forth , -- not without difficulty , the Ushers almost
trembling to obey . Triumvirat and Company are packed forth , into Salut
Committee @-@ room ; their tongue cleaving to the roof of their mouth . You
have but to summon the Municipality ; to cashier Commandant Henriot , and
launch Arrest at him ; to regular formalities ; hand Tinville his victims .
It is noon : the Aeolus @-@ Hall has delivered itself ; blows now victorious ,
harmonious , as one irresistible wind .

And so the work is finished ? One thinks so ; and yet it is not so . Alas ,
there is yet but the first @-@ act finished ; three or four other acts still
to come ; and an uncertain catastrophe ! A huge City holds in it so many
confusions : seven hundred thousand human heads ; not one of which
knows what its neighbour is doing , nay not what itself is doing . -- See ,
accordingly , about three in the afternoon , Commandant Henriot , how
instead of sitting cashiered , arrested , he gallops along the Quais ,
followed by Municipal Gendarmes , &apos; trampling down several persons ! &apos; For
the Townhall sits deliberating , openly insurgent : Barriers to be shut ;
no Gaoler to admit any Prisoner this day ; -- and Henriot is galloping
towards the Tuileries , to deliver Robespierre . On the Quai de la
Ferraillerie , a young Citoyen , walking with his wife , says aloud :
&quot; Gendarmes , that man is not your Commandant ; he is under arrest . &quot; The
Gendarmes strike down the young Citoyen with the flat of their swords .
( Precis des evenemens du Neuf Thermidor , par C.A. Meda , ancien Gendarme ,
Paris , 1825 . )

Representatives themselves ( as Merlin the Thionviller ) who accost him ,
this puissant Henriot flings into guardhouses . He bursts towards the
Tuileries Committee @-@ room , &quot; to speak with Robespierre : &quot; with difficulty ,
the Ushers and Tuileries Gendarmes , earnestly pleading and drawing
sabre , seize this Henriot ; get the Henriot Gendarmes persuaded not to
fight ; get Robespierre and Company packed into hackney @-@ coaches , sent off
under escort , to the Luxembourg and other Prisons . This then is the end ?
May not an exhausted Convention adjourn now , for a little repose and
sustenance , &apos; at five o &apos;clock ? &apos;

An exhausted Convention did it ; and repented it . The end was not come ;
only the end of the second @-@ act . Hark , while exhausted Representatives
sit at victuals , -- tocsin bursting from all steeples , drums rolling , in
the summer evening : Judge Coffinhal is galloping with new Gendarmes to
deliver Henriot from Tuileries Committee @-@ room ; and does deliver him !
Puissant Henriot vaults on horseback ; sets to haranguing the Tuileries
Gendarmes ; corrupts the Tuileries Gendarmes too ; trots off with them to
Townhall . Alas , and Robespierre is not in Prison : the Gaoler shewed his
Municipal order , durst not on pain of his life , admit any Prisoner ; the
Robespierre Hackney @-@ coaches , in confused jangle and whirl of uncertain
Gendarmes , have floated safe -- into the Townhall ! There sit Robespierre
and Company , embraced by Municipals and Jacobins , in sacred right of
Insurrection ; redacting Proclamations ; sounding tocsins ; corresponding
with Sections and Mother Society . Is not here a pretty enough third @-@ act
of a natural Greek Drama ; catastrophe more uncertain than ever ?

The hasty Convention rushes together again , in the ominous nightfall :
President Collot , for the chair is his , enters with long strides ,
paleness on his face ; claps on his hat ; says with solemn tone :
&quot; Citoyens , armed Villains have beset the Committee @-@ rooms , and got
possession of them . The hour is come , to die at our post ! &quot; &quot; Oui , &quot; answer
one and all : &quot; We swear it ! &quot; It is no rhodomontade , this time , but a sad
fact and necessity ; unless we do at our posts , we must verily die ! Swift
therefore , Robespierre , Henriot , the Municipality , are declared Rebels ;
put Hors la Loi , Out of Law . Better still , we appoint Barras Commandant
of what Armed @-@ Force is to be had ; send Missionary Representatives to
all Sections and quarters , to preach , and raise force ; will die at least
with harness on our back .

What a distracted City ; men riding and running , reporting and
hearsaying ; the Hour clearly in travail , -- child not to be named till
born ! The poor Prisoners in the Luxembourg hear the rumour ; tremble for
a new September . They see men making signals to them , on skylights and
roofs , apparently signals of hope ; cannot in the least make out what
it is . ( Memoires sur les Prisons , ii . 277 . ) We observe however , in the
eventide , as usual , the Death @-@ tumbrils faring South @-@ eastward , through
Saint @-@ Antoine , towards their Barrier du Trone . Saint @-@ Antoine &apos;s tough
bowels melt ; Saint @-@ Antoine surrounds the Tumbrils ; says , It shall
not be . O Heavens , why should it ! Henriot and Gendarmes , scouring the
streets that way , bellow , with waved sabres , that it must . Quit hope , ye
poor Doomed ! The Tumbrils move on .

But in this set of Tumbrils there are two other things notable : one
notable person ; and one want of a notable person . The notable person
is Lieutenant @-@ General Loiserolles , a nobleman by birth , and by nature ;
laying down his life here for his son . In the Prison of Saint @-@ Lazare ,
the night before last , hurrying to the Grate to hear the Death @-@ list
read , he caught the name of his son . The son was asleep at the moment .
&quot; I am Loiserolles , &quot; cried the old man : at Tinville &apos;s bar , an error in
the Christian name is little ; small objection was made . The want of the
notable person , again , is that of Deputy Paine ! Paine has sat in the
Luxembourg since January ; and seemed forgotten ; but Fouquier had pricked
him at last . The Turnkey , List in hand , is marking with chalk the outer
doors of to @-@ morrow &apos;s Fournee . Paine &apos;s outer door happened to be open ,
turned back on the wall ; the Turnkey marked it on the side next him ,
and hurried on : another Turnkey came , and shut it ; no chalk @-@ mark now
visible , the Fournee went without Paine . Paine &apos;s life lay not there . --

Our fifth @-@ act , of this natural Greek Drama , with its natural unities ,
can only be painted in gross ; somewhat as that antique Painter , driven
desperate , did the foam ! For through this blessed July night , there is
clangour , confusion very great , of marching troops ; of Sections going
this way , Sections going that ; of Missionary Representatives reading
Proclamations by torchlight ; Missionary Legendre , who has raised force
somewhere , emptying out the Jacobins , and flinging their key on the
Convention table : &quot; I have locked their door ; it shall be Virtue that
re @-@ opens it . &quot; Paris , we say , is set against itself , rushing confused ,
as Ocean @-@ currents do ; a huge Mahlstrom , sounding there , under cloud
of night . Convention sits permanent on this hand ; Municipality most
permanent on that . The poor Prisoners hear tocsin and rumour ; strive to
bethink them of the signals apparently of hope . Meek continual Twilight
streaming up , which will be Dawn and a To @-@ morrow , silvers the Northern
hem of Night ; it wends and wends there , that meek brightness , like a
silent prophecy , along the great Ring @-@ Dial of the Heaven . So still ,
eternal ! And on Earth all is confused shadow and conflict ; dissidence ,
tumultuous gloom and glare ; and Destiny as yet shakes her doubtful urn .

About three in the morning , the dissident Armed @-@ Forces have met .
Henriot &apos;s Armed Force stood ranked in the Place de Greve ; and now
Barras &apos;s , which he has recruited , arrives there ; and they front each
other , cannon bristling against cannon . Citoyens ! cries the voice
of Discretion , loudly enough , Before coming to bloodshed , to endless
civil @-@ war , hear the Convention Decree read : &apos; Robespierre and all rebels
Out of Law ! &apos; -- Out of Law ? There is terror in the sound : unarmed Citoyens
disperse rapidly home ; Municipal Cannoneers range themselves on the
Convention side , with shouting . At which shout , Henriot descends from
his upper room , far gone in drink as some say ; finds his Place de Greve
empty ; the cannons &apos; mouth turned towards him ; and , on the whole , -- that
it is now the catastrophe !

Stumbling in again , the wretched drunk @-@ sobered Henriot announces : &quot; All
is lost ! &quot; &quot; Miserable ! it is thou that hast lost it , &quot; cry they : and fling
him , or else he flings himself , out of window : far enough down ; into
masonwork and horror of cesspool ; not into death but worse . Augustin
Robespierre follows him ; with the like fate . Saint @-@ Just called on Lebas
to kill him : who would not . Couthon crept under a table ; attempting to
kill himself ; not doing it . -- On entering that Sanhedrim of Insurrection ,
we find all as good as extinct ; undone , ready for seizure . Robespierre
was sitting on a chair , with pistol shot blown through , not his head ,
but his under jaw ; the suicidal hand had failed . ( Meda. p . 384 . )
Meda asserts that it was he who , with infinite courage , though in a
lefthanded manner , shot Robespierre . Meda got promoted for his services
of this night ; and died General and Baron . Few credited Meda ( in what
was otherwise incredible . ) With prompt zeal , not without trouble , we
gather these wretched Conspirators ; fish up even Henriot and Augustin ,
bleeding and foul ; pack them all , rudely enough , into carts ; and shall ,
before sunrise , have them safe under lock and key . Amid shoutings and
embracings .

Robespierre lay in an anteroom of the Convention Hall , while his
Prison @-@ escort was getting ready ; the mangled jaw bound up rudely with
bloody linen : a spectacle to men . He lies stretched on a table ,
a deal @-@ box his pillow ; the sheath of the pistol is still clenched
convulsively in his hand . Men bully him , insult him : his eyes still
indicate intelligence ; he speaks no word . &apos; He had on the sky @-@ blue coat
he had got made for the Feast of the Etre Supreme &apos; -- O reader , can
thy hard heart hold out against that ? His trousers were nankeen ; the
stockings had fallen down over the ankles . He spake no word more in this
world .

And so , at six in the morning , a victorious Convention adjourns . Report
flies over Paris as on golden wings ; penetrates the Prisons ; irradiates
the faces of those that were ready to perish : turnkeys and moutons ,
fallen from their high estate , look mute and blue . It is the 28th day of
July , called 10th of Thermidor , year 1794 .

Fouquier had but to identify ; his Prisoners being already Out of Law .
At four in the afternoon , never before were the streets of Paris seen so
crowded . From the Palais de Justice to the Place de la Revolution , for
thither again go the Tumbrils this time , it is one dense stirring mass ;
all windows crammed ; the very roofs and ridge @-@ tiles budding forth human
Curiosity , in strange gladness . The Death @-@ tumbrils , with their motley
Batch of Outlaws , some Twenty @-@ three or so , from Maximilien to
Mayor Fleuriot and Simon the Cordwainer , roll on . All eyes are on
Robespierre &apos;s Tumbril , where he , his jaw bound in dirty linen , with
his half @-@ dead Brother , and half @-@ dead Henriot , lie shattered ; their
&apos;seventeen hours &apos; of agony about to end . The Gendarmes point their
swords at him , to shew the people which is he . A woman springs on
the Tumbril ; clutching the side of it with one hand ; waving the other
Sibyl @-@ like ; and exclaims : &quot; The death of thee gladdens my very heart ,
m &apos;enivre de joie ; &quot; Robespierre opened his eyes ; &quot; Scelerat , go down to
Hell , with the curses of all wives and mothers ! &quot; -- At the foot of the
scaffold , they stretched him on the ground till his turn came . Lifted
aloft , his eyes again opened ; caught the bloody axe . Samson wrenched
the coat off him ; wrenched the dirty linen from his jaw : the jaw fell
powerless , there burst from him a cry ; -- hideous to hear and see . Samson ,
thou canst not be too quick !

Samson &apos;s work done , there burst forth shout on shout of applause . Shout ,
which prolongs itself not only over Paris , but over France , but over
Europe , and down to this Generation . Deservedly , and also undeservedly .
O unhappiest Advocate of Arras , wert thou worse than other Advocates ?
Stricter man , according to his Formula , to his Credo and his Cant , of
probities , benevolences , pleasures @-@ of @-@ virtue , and such like , lived not
in that age . A man fitted , in some luckier settled age , to have
become one of those incorruptible barren Pattern @-@ Figures , and have had
marble @-@ tablets and funeral @-@ sermons ! His poor landlord , the Cabinetmaker
in the Rue Saint @-@ Honore , loved him ; his Brother died for him . May God be
merciful to him , and to us .

This is end of the Reign of Terror ; new glorious Revolution named of
Thermidor ; of Thermidor 9th , year 2 ; which being interpreted into old
slave @-@ style means 27th of July , 1794 . Terror is ended ; and death in the
Place de la Revolution , were the &apos; Tail of Robespierre &apos; once executed ;
which service Fouquier in large Batches is swiftly managing .

Chapter 3.7.I.

Decadent .

How little did any one suppose that here was the end not of Robespierre
only , but of the Revolution System itself ! Least of all did the
mutinying Committee @-@ men suppose it ; who had mutinied with no view
whatever except to continue the National Regeneration with their own
heads on their shoulders . And yet so it verily was . The insignificant
stone they had struck out , so insignificant anywhere else , proved to be
the Keystone : the whole arch @-@ work and edifice of Sansculottism began
to loosen , to crack , to yawn ; and tumbled , piecemeal , with considerable
rapidity , plunge after plunge ; till the Abyss had swallowed it all , and
in this upper world Sansculottism was no more .

For despicable as Robespierre himself might be , the death of Robespierre
was a signal at which great multitudes of men , struck dumb with terror
heretofore , rose out of their hiding places : and , as it were , saw
one another , how multitudinous they were ; and began speaking and
complaining . They are countable by the thousand and the million ; who
have suffered cruel wrong . Ever louder rises the plaint of such a
multitude ; into a universal sound , into a universal continuous peal ,
of what they call Public Opinion . Camille had demanded a &apos; Committee of
Mercy , &apos; and could not get it ; but now the whole nation resolves itself
into a Committee of Mercy : the Nation has tried Sansculottism , and
is weary of it . Force of Public Opinion ! What King or Convention can
withstand it ? You in vain struggle : the thing that is rejected as
&apos;calumnious &apos; to @-@ day must pass as veracious with triumph another day :
gods and men have declared that Sansculottism cannot be . Sansculottism ,
on that Ninth night of Thermidor suicidally &apos; fractured its under jaw ; &apos;
and lies writhing , never to rise more .

Through the next fifteenth months , it is what we may call the
death @-@ agony of Sansculottism . Sansculottism , Anarchy of the Jean @-@ Jacques
Evangel , having now got deep enough , is to perish in a new singular
system of Culottism and Arrangement . For Arrangement is indispensable to
man ; Arrangement , were it grounded only on that old primary Evangel of
Force , with Sceptre in the shape of Hammer . Be there method , be there
order , cry all men ; were it that of the Drill @-@ serjeant ! More
tolerable is the drilled Bayonet @-@ rank , than that undrilled Guillotine ,
incalculable as the wind . -- How Sansculottism , writhing in death @-@ throes ,
strove some twice , or even three times , to get on its feet again ; but
fell always , and was flung resupine , the next instant ; and finally
breathed out the life of it , and stirred no more : this we are now ,
from a due distance , with due brevity , to glance at ; and then -- O
Reader ! -- Courage , I see land !

Two of the first acts of the Convention , very natural for it after
this Thermidor , are to be specified here : the first is renewal of the
Governing Committees . Both Surete Generale and Salut Public , thinned
by the Guillotine , need filling up : we naturally fill them up with
Talliens , Frerons , victorious Thermidorian men . Still more to the
purpose , we appoint that they shall , as Law directs , not in name only
but in deed , be renewed and changed from period to period ; a fourth part
of them going out monthly . The Convention will no more lie under bondage
of Committees , under terror of death ; but be a free Convention ; free
to follow its own judgment , and the Force of Public Opinion . Not less
natural is it to enact that Prisoners and Persons under Accusation shall
have right to demand some &apos; Writ of Accusation , &apos; and see clearly what
they are accused of . Very natural acts : the harbingers of hundreds not
less so .

For now Fouquier &apos;s trade , shackled by Writ of Accusation , and legal
proof , is as good as gone ; effectual only against Robespierre &apos;s Tail .
The Prisons give up their Suspects ; emit them faster and faster . The
Committees see themselves besieged with Prisoners &apos; friends ; complain
that they are hindered in their work : it is as with men rushing out of
a crowded place ; and obstructing one another . Turned are the tables :
Prisoners pouring out in floods ; Jailors , Moutons and the Tail of
Robespierre going now whither they were wont to send ! -- The Hundred and
thirty @-@ two Nantese Republicans , whom we saw marching in irons , have
arrived ; shrunk to Ninety @-@ four , the fifth man of them choked by the
road . They arrive : and suddenly find themselves not pleaders for life ,
but denouncers to death . Their Trial is for acquittal , and more . As the
voice of a trumpet , their testimony sounds far and wide , mere atrocities
of a Reign of Terror . For a space of nineteen days ; with all solemnity
and publicity . Representative Carrier , Company of Marat ; Noyadings ,
Loire Marriages , things done in darkness , come forth into light : clear
is the voice of these poor resuscitated Nantese ; and Journals and Speech
and universal Committee of Mercy reverberate it loud enough , into
all ears and hearts . Deputation arrives from Arras ; denouncing the
atrocities of Representative Lebon . A tamed Convention loves its own
life : yet what help ? Representative Lebon , Representative Carrier must
wend towards the Revolutionary Tribunal ; struggle and delay as we will ,
the cry of a Nation pursues them louder and louder . Them also Tinville
must abolish ; -- if indeed Tinville himself be not abolished .

We must note moreover the decrepit condition into which a once
omnipotent Mother Society has fallen . Legendre flung her keys on the
Convention table , that Thermidor night ; her President was guillotined
with Robespierre . The once mighty Mother came , some time after , with a
subdued countenance , begging back her keys : the keys were restored her ;
but the strength could not be restored her ; the strength had departed
forever . Alas , one &apos;s day is done . Vain that the Tribune in mid air
sounds as of old : to the general ear it has become a horror , and even a
weariness . By and by , Affiliation is prohibited : the mighty Mother sees
herself suddenly childless ; mourns , as so hoarse a Rachel may .

The Revolutionary Committees , without Suspects to prey upon , perish
fast ; as it were of famine . In Paris the whole Forty @-@ eight of them are
reduced to Twelve , their Forty sous are abolished : yet a little while ,
and Revolutionary Committees are no more . Maximum will be abolished ; let
Sansculottism find food where it can . ( 24th December 1794 , Moniteur , No .
97 . ) Neither is there now any Municipality ; any centre at the Townhall .
Mayor Fleuriot and Company perished ; whom we shall not be in haste to
replace . The Townhall remains in a broken submissive state ; knows not
well what it is growing to ; knows only that it is grown weak , and
must obey . What if we should split Paris into , say , a Dozen separate
Municipalities ; incapable of concert ! The Sections were thus rendered
safe to act with : -- or indeed might not the Sections themselves be
abolished ? You had then merely your Twelve manageable pacific Townships ,
without centre or subdivision ; ( October 1795 , Dulaure , viii . 454 @-@ 6 . )
and sacred right of Insurrection fell into abeyance !

So much is getting abolished ; fleeting swiftly into the Inane . For
the Press speaks , and the human tongue ; Journals , heavy and light , in
Philippic and Burlesque : a renegade Freron , a renegade Prudhomme , loud
they as ever , only the contrary way . And Ci @-@ devants shew themselves ,
almost parade themselves ; resuscitated as from death @-@ sleep ; publish
what death @-@ pains they have had . The very Frogs of the Marsh croak with
emphasis . Your protesting Seventy @-@ three shall , with a struggle , be
emitted out of Prison , back to their seats ; your Louvets , Isnards ,
Lanjuinais , and wrecks of Girondism , recalled from their haylofts , and
caves in Switzerland , will resume their place in the Convention : ( Deux
Amis , xiii . 3 @-@ 39 . ) natural foes of Terror !

Thermidorian Talliens , and mere foes of Terror , rule in this Convention ,
and out of it . The compressed Mountain shrinks silent more and more .
Moderatism rises louder and louder : not as a tempest , with threatenings ;
say rather , as the rushing of a mighty organ @-@ blast , and melodious
deafening Force of Public Opinion , from the Twenty @-@ five million
windpipes of a Nation all in Committee of Mercy : which how shall any
detached body of individuals withstand ?



Chapter 3.7.II.

La Cabarus .

How , above all , shall a poor National Convention , withstand it ? In
this poor National Convention , broken , bewildered by long terror ,
perturbations , and guillotinement , there is no Pilot , there is not now
even a Danton , who could undertake to steer you anywhither , in such
press of weather . The utmost a bewildered Convention can do , is to veer ,
and trim , and try to keep itself steady : and rush , undrowned , before the
wind . Needless to struggle ; to fling helm a @-@ lee , and make &apos; bout ship ! A
bewildered Convention sails not in the teeth of the wind ; but is rapidly
blown round again . So strong is the wind , we say ; and so changed ;
blowing fresher and fresher , as from the sweet South @-@ West ; your
devastating North @-@ Easters , and wild tornado @-@ gusts of Terror , blown
utterly out ! All Sansculottic things are passing away ; all things are
becoming Culottic .

Do but look at the cut of clothes ; that light visible Result ,
significant of a thousand things which are not so visible . In winter
1793 , men went in red nightcaps ; Municipals themselves in sabots : the
very Citoyennes had to petition against such headgear . But now in this
winter 1794 , where is the red nightcap ? With the thing beyond the Flood .
Your monied Citoyen ponders in what elegantest style he shall dress
himself : whether he shall not even dress himself as the Free Peoples of
Antiquity . The more adventurous Citoyenne has already done it . Behold
her , that beautiful adventurous Citoyenne : in costume of the Ancient
Greeks , such Greek as Painter David could teach ; her sweeping tresses
snooded by glittering antique fillet ; bright @-@ eyed tunic of the Greek
women ; her little feet naked , as in Antique Statues , with mere sandals ,
and winding @-@ strings of riband , -- defying the frost !

There is such an effervescence of Luxury . For your Emigrant Ci @-@ devants
carried not their mansions and furnitures out of the country with them ;
but left them standing here : and in the swift changes of property ,
what with money coined on the Place de la Revolution , what with
Army @-@ furnishings , sales of Emigrant Domain and Church Lands and
King &apos;s Lands , and then with the Aladdin &apos;s @-@ lamp of Agio in a time of
Paper @-@ money , such mansions have found new occupants . Old wine , drawn
from Ci @-@ devant bottles , descends new throats . Paris has swept herself ,
relighted herself ; Salons , Soupers not Fraternal , beam once more with
suitable effulgence , very singular in colour . The fair Cabarus is come
out of Prison ; wedded to her red @-@ gloomy Dis , whom they say she treats
too loftily : fair Cabarus gives the most brilliant soirees . Round her is
gathered a new Republican Army , of Citoyennes in sandals ; Ci @-@ devants or
other : what remnants soever of the old grace survive , are rallied there .
At her right @-@ hand , in this cause , labours fair Josephine the Widow
Beauharnais , though in straitened circumstances : intent , both of them ,
to blandish down the grimness of Republican austerity , and recivilise
mankind .

Recivilise , as of old they were civilised : by witchery of the Orphic
fiddle @-@ bow , and Euterpean rhythm ; by the Graces , by the Smiles !
Thermidorian Deputies are there in those soirees ; Editor Freron , Orateur
du Peuple ; Barras , who has known other dances than the Carmagnole . Grim
Generals of the Republic are there ; in enormous horse @-@ collar neckcloth ,
good against sabre @-@ cuts ; the hair gathered all into one knot , &apos; flowing
down behind , fixed with a comb . &apos; Among which latter do we not recognise ,
once more , the little bronzed @-@ complexioned Artillery @-@ Officer of Toulon ,
home from the Italian Wars ! Grim enough ; of lean , almost cruel aspect :
for he has been in trouble , in ill health ; also in ill favour , as a man
promoted , deservingly or not , by the Terrorists and Robespierre Junior .
But does not Barras know him ? Will not Barras speak a word for him ?
Yes , -- if at any time it will serve Barras so to do . Somewhat forlorn
of fortune , for the present , stands that Artillery @-@ Officer ; looks , with
those deep earnest eyes of his , into a future as waste as the most .
Taciturn ; yet with the strangest utterances in him , if you awaken
him , which smite home , like light or lightning : -- on the whole , rather
dangerous ? A &apos; dissociable &apos; man ? Dissociable enough ; a natural terror and
horror to all Phantasms , being himself of the genus Reality ! He stands
here , without work or outlook , in this forsaken manner ; -- glances
nevertheless , it would seem , at the kind glance of Josephine
Beauharnais ; and , for the rest , with severe countenance , with open eyes
and closed lips , waits what will betide .

That the Balls , therefore , have a new figure this winter , we can see .
Not Carmagnoles , rude &apos; whirlblasts of rags , &apos; as Mercier called them
&apos;precursors of storm and destruction : &apos; no , soft Ionic motions ; fit for
the light sandal , and antique Grecian tunic ! Efflorescence of Luxury has
come out : for men have wealth ; nay new @-@ got wealth ; and under the Terror
you durst not dance except in rags . Among the innumerable kinds of
Balls , let the hasty reader mark only this single one : the kind they
call Victim Balls , Bals a Victime . The dancers , in choice costume , have
all crape round the left arm : to be admitted , it needs that you be a
Victime ; that you have lost a relative under the Terror . Peace to the
Dead ; let us dance to their memory ! For in all ways one must dance .

It is very remarkable , according to Mercier , under what varieties of
figure this great business of dancing goes on . &apos; The women , &apos; says he ,
&apos;are Nymphs , Sultanas ; sometimes Minervas , Junos , even Dianas . In
light @-@ unerring gyrations they swim there ; with such earnestness of
purpose ; with perfect silence , so absorbed are they . What is singular , &apos;
continues he , &apos; the onlookers are as it were mingled with the
dancers ; form as it were a circumambient element round the different
contre @-@ dances , yet without deranging them . It is rare , in fact , that
a Sultana in such circumstances experience the smallest collision . Her
pretty foot darts down , an inch from mine ; she is off again ; she is as
a flash of light : but soon the measure recalls her to the point she set
out from . Like a glittering comet she travels her eclipse , revolving on
herself , as by a double effect of gravitation and attraction . &apos; ( Mercier ,
Nouveau Paris , iii . 138 , 153 . ) Looking forward a little way , into Time ,
the same Mercier discerns Merveilleuses in &apos; flesh @-@ coloured drawers &apos; with
gold circlets ; mere dancing Houris of an artificial Mahomet &apos;s @-@ Paradise :
much too Mahometan . Montgaillard , with his splenetic eye , notes a no
less strange thing ; that every fashionable Citoyenne you meet is in an
interesting situation . Good Heavens , every ! Mere pillows and stuffing !
adds the acrid man ; -- such , in a time of depopulation by war and
guillotine , being the fashion . ( Montgaillard , iv . 436 @-@ 42 . ) No further
seek its merits to disclose .

Behold also instead of the old grim Tappe @-@ durs of Robespierre , what new
street @-@ groups are these ? Young men habited not in black @-@ shag Carmagnole
spencer , but in superfine habit carre or spencer with rectangular tail
appended to it ; &apos; square @-@ tailed coat , &apos; with elegant antiguillotinish
specialty of collar ; &apos; the hair plaited at the temples , &apos; and knotted
back , long @-@ flowing , in military wise : young men of what they call the
Muscadin or Dandy species ! Freron , in his fondness names them Jeunesse
doree , Golden , or Gilt Youth . They have come out , these Gilt Youths , in
a kind of resuscitated state ; they wear crape round the left arm , such
of them as were Victims . More they carry clubs loaded with lead ; in an
angry manner : any Tappe @-@ dur or remnant of Jacobinism they may fall
in with , shall fare the worse . They have suffered much : their friends
guillotined ; their pleasures , frolics , superfine collars ruthlessly
repressed : &apos; ware now the base Red Nightcaps who did it ! Fair Cabarus and
the Army of Greek sandals smile approval . In the Theatre Feydeau , young
Valour in square @-@ tailed coat eyes Beauty in Greek sandals , and kindles
by her glances : Down with Jacobinism ! No Jacobin hymn or demonstration ,
only Thermidorian ones , shall be permitted here : we beat down Jacobinism
with clubs loaded with lead .

But let any one who has examined the Dandy nature , how petulant it is ,
especially in the gregarious state , think what an element , in sacred
right of insurrection , this Gilt Youth was ! Broils and battery ; war
without truce or measure ! Hateful is Sansculottism , as Death and Night .
For indeed is not the Dandy culottic , habilatory , by law of existence ;
&apos;a cloth @-@ animal : one that lives , moves , and has his being in cloth ? &apos; --

So goes it , waltzing , bickering ; fair Cabarus , by Orphic witchery ,
struggling to recivilise mankind . Not unsuccessfully , we hear . What
utmost Republican grimness can resist Greek sandals , in Ionic motion ,
the very toes covered with gold rings ? ( Ibid . Mercier , ubi supra . ) By
degrees the indisputablest new @-@ politeness rises ; grows , with vigour . And
yet , whether , even to this day , that inexpressible tone of society known
under the old Kings , when Sin had &apos; lost all its deformity &apos; ( with or
without advantage to us ) , and airy Nothing had obtained such a local
habitation and establishment as she never had , -- be recovered ? Or even ,
whether it be not lost beyond recovery ? ( De Stael , Considerations iii .
c . 10 , &amp; c . ) -- Either way , the world must contrive to struggle on .



Chapter 3.7.III.

Quiberon .


But indeed do not these long @-@ flowing hair @-@ queues of a Jeunesse Doree
in semi @-@ military costume betoken , unconsciously , another still more
important tendency ? The Republic , abhorrent of her Guillotine , loves her
Army .

And with cause . For , surely , if good fighting be a kind of honour , as it
is , in its season ; and be with the vulgar of men , even the chief kind of
honour , then here is good fighting , in good season , if there ever was .
These Sons of the Republic , they rose , in mad wrath , to deliver her from
Slavery and Cimmeria . And have they not done it ? Through Maritime Alps ,
through gorges of Pyrenees , through Low Countries , Northward along the
Rhine @-@ valley , far is Cimmeria hurled back from the sacred Motherland .
Fierce as fire , they have carried her Tricolor over the faces of all her
enemies ; -- over scarped heights , over cannon @-@ batteries ; down , as with
the Vengeur , into the dead deep sea . She has &apos; Eleven hundred thousand
fighters on foot , &apos; this Republic : &apos; At one particular moment she had , &apos; or
supposed she had , &apos; seventeen hundred thousand . &apos; ( Toulongeon , iii. c .
7 ; v. c . 10 , p . 194 . ) Like a ring of lightning , they , volleying and
ca @-@ ira @-@ ing , begirdle her from shore to shore . Cimmerian Coalition of
Despots recoils ; smitten with astonishment , and strange pangs .

Such a fire is in these Gaelic Republican men ; high @-@ blazing ; which no
Coalition can withstand ! Not scutcheons , with four degrees of nobility ;
but ci @-@ devant Serjeants , who have had to clutch Generalship out of the
cannon &apos;s throat , a Pichegru , a Jourdan , a Hoche , lead them on . They have
bread , they have iron ; &apos; with bread and iron you can get to China . &apos; -- See
Pichegru &apos;s soldiers , this hard winter , in their looped and windowed
destitution , in their &apos; straw @-@ rope shoes and cloaks of bass @-@ mat , &apos; how
they overrun Holland , like a demon @-@ host , the ice having bridged all
waters ; and rush shouting from victory to victory ! Ships in the
Texel are taken by huzzars on horseback : fled is York ; fled is the
Stadtholder , glad to escape to England , and leave Holland to fraternise .
( 19th January , 1795 , Montgaillard , iv . 287 @-@ 311 . ) Such a Gaelic fire ,
we say , blazes in this People , like the conflagration of grass and
dry @-@ jungle ; which no mortal can withstand -- for the moment .

And even so it will blaze and run , scorching all things ; and , from Cadiz
to Archangel , mad Sansculottism , drilled now into Soldiership , led on
by some &apos; armed Soldier of Democracy &apos; ( say , that Monosyllabic
Artillery @-@ Officer ) , will set its foot cruelly on the necks of
its enemies ; and its shouting and their shrieking shall fill the
world ! -- Rash Coalised Kings , such a fire have ye kindled ; yourselves
fireless , your fighters animated only by drill @-@ serjeants , messroom
moralities , and the drummer &apos;s cat ! However , it is begun , and will
not end : not for a matter of twenty years . So long , this Gaelic fire ,
through its successive changes of colour and character , will blaze over
the face of Europe , and afflict the scorch all men : -- till it provoke all
men ; till it kindle another kind of fire , the Teutonic kind , namely ; and
be swallowed up , so to speak , in a day ! For there is a fire comparable
to the burning of dry @-@ jungle and grass ; most sudden , high @-@ blazing :
and another fire which we liken to the burning of coal , or even of
anthracite coal ; difficult to kindle , but then which nothing will put
out . The ready Gaelic fire , we can remark further , and remark not in
Pichegrus only , but in innumerable Voltaires , Racines , Laplaces , no
less ; for a man , whether he fight , or sing , or think , will remain
the same unity of a man , -- is admirable for roasting eggs , in every
conceivable sense . The Teutonic anthracite again , as we see in Luthers ,
Leibnitzes , Shakespeares , is preferable for smelting metals . How happy
is our Europe that has both kinds ! --

But be this as it may , the Republic is clearly triumphing . In the spring
of the year Mentz Town again sees itself besieged ; will again change
master : did not Merlin the Thionviller , &apos; with wild beard and look , &apos; say
it was not for the last time they saw him there ? The Elector of Mentz
circulates among his brother Potentates this pertinent query , Were it
not advisable to treat of Peace ? Yes ! answers many an Elector from the
bottom of his heart . But , on the other hand , Austria hesitates ; finally
refuses , being subsidied by Pitt . As to Pitt , whoever hesitate , he ,
suspending his Habeas @-@ corpus , suspending his Cash @-@ payments , stands
inflexible , -- spite of foreign reverses ; spite of domestic obstacles , of
Scotch National Conventions and English Friends of the People , whom he
is obliged to arraign , to hang , or even to see acquitted with jubilee : a
lean inflexible man . The Majesty of Spain , as we predicted , makes Peace ;
also the Majesty of Prussia : and there is a Treaty of Bale . ( 5th
April , 1795 , Montgaillard , iv . 319 . ) Treaty with black Anarchists and
Regicides ! Alas , what help ? You cannot hang this Anarchy ; it is like to
hang you : you must needs treat with it .

Likewise , General Hoche has even succeeded in pacificating La Vendee .
Rogue Rossignol and his &apos; Infernal Columns &apos; have vanished : by firmness
and justice , by sagacity and industry , General Hoche has done it . Taking
&apos;Movable Columns , &apos; not infernal ; girdling @-@ in the Country ; pardoning the
submissive , cutting down the resistive , limb after limb of the Revolt
is brought under . La Rochejacquelin , last of our Nobles , fell in battle ;
Stofflet himself makes terms ; Georges @-@ Cadoudal is back to Brittany ,
among his Chouans : the frightful gangrene of La Vendee seems veritably
extirpated . It has cost , as they reckon in round numbers , the lives of
a Hundred Thousand fellow @-@ mortals ; with noyadings , conflagratings by
infernal column , which defy arithmetic . This is the La Vendee War .
( Histoire de la Guerre de la Vendee , par M. le Comte de Vauban , Memoires
de Madame de la Rochejacquelin , &amp; c . )

Nay in few months , it does burst up once more , but once only : -- blown
upon by Pitt , by our Ci @-@ devant Puisaye of Calvados , and others . In the
month of July 1795 , English Ships will ride in Quiberon roads .
There will be debarkation of chivalrous Ci @-@ devants , of volunteer
Prisoners @-@ of @-@ war -- eager to desert ; of fire @-@ arms , Proclamations ,
clothes @-@ chests , Royalists and specie . Whereupon also , on the Republican
side , there will be rapid stand @-@ to @-@ arms ; with ambuscade marchings by
Quiberon beach , at midnight ; storming of Fort Penthievre ; war @-@ thunder
mingling with the roar of the nightly main ; and such a morning light as
has seldom dawned ; debarkation hurled back into its boats , or into
the devouring billows , with wreck and wail ; -- in one word , a Ci @-@ devant
Puisaye as totally ineffectual here as he was in Calvados , when he rode
from Vernon Castle without boots . ( Deux Amis , xiv . 94 @-@ 106 ; Puisaye ,
Memoires , iii @-@ vii . )

Again , therefore , it has cost the lives of many a brave man . Among whom
the whole world laments the brave Son of Sombreuil . Ill @-@ fated family !
The father and younger son went to the guillotine ; the heroic daughter
languishes , reduced to want , hides her woes from History : the elder son
perishes here ; shot by military tribunal as an Emigrant ; Hoche himself
cannot save him . If all wars , civil and other , are misunderstandings ,
what a thing must right @-@ understanding be !



Chapter 3.7.IV.

Lion not dead .

The Convention , borne on the tide of Fortune towards foreign Victory ,
and driven by the strong wind of Public Opinion towards Clemency and
Luxury , is rushing fast ; all skill of pilotage is needed , and more than
all , in such a velocity .

Curious to see , how we veer and whirl , yet must ever whirl round
again , and scud before the wind . If , on the one hand , we re @-@ admit the
Protesting Seventy @-@ Three , we , on the other hand , agree to consummate
the Apotheosis of Marat ; lift his body from the Cordeliers Church , and
transport it to the Pantheon of Great Men , -- flinging out Mirabeau to
make room for him . To no purpose : so strong blows Public Opinion ! A
Gilt Youthhood , in plaited hair @-@ tresses , tears down his Busts from
the Theatre Feydeau ; tramples them under foot ; scatters them , with
vociferation into the Cesspool of Montmartre . ( Moniteur , du 25 Septembre
1794 , du 4 Fevrier 1795 . ) Swept is his Chapel from the Place du
Carrousel ; the Cesspool of Montmartre will receive his very dust .
Shorter godhood had no divine man . Some four months in this Pantheon ,
Temple of All the Immortals ; then to the Cesspool , grand Cloaca of
Paris and the World ! &apos; His Busts at one time amounted to four thousand . &apos; 
Between Temple of All the Immortals and Cloaca of the World , how are
poor human creatures whirled !

Furthermore the question arises , When will the Constitution of
Ninety @-@ three , of 1793 , come into action ? Considerate heads surmise , in
all privacy , that the Constitution of Ninety @-@ three will never come into
action . Let them busy themselves to get ready a better .

Or , again , where now are the Jacobins ? Childless , most decrepit , as we
saw , sat the mighty Mother ; gnashing not teeth , but empty gums , against
a traitorous Thermidorian Convention and the current of things . Twice
were Billaud , Collot and Company accused in Convention , by a Lecointre ,
by a Legendre ; and the second time , it was not voted calumnious .
Billaud from the Jacobin tribune says , &quot; The lion is not dead , he is only
sleeping . &quot; They ask him in Convention , What he means by the awakening
of the lion ? And bickerings , of an extensive sort , arose in the
Palais @-@ Egalite between Tappe @-@ durs and the Gilt Youthhood ; cries of &quot; Down
with the Jacobins , the Jacoquins , &quot; coquin meaning scoundrel ! The Tribune
in mid @-@ air gave battle @-@ sound ; answered only by silence and uncertain
gasps . Talk was , in Government Committees , of &apos; suspending &apos; the Jacobin
Sessions . Hark , there ! -- it is in Allhallow @-@ time , or on the Hallow @-@ eve
itself , month ci @-@ devant November , year once named of Grace 1794 , sad
eve for Jacobinism , -- volley of stones dashing through our windows ,
with jingle and execration ! The female Jacobins , famed Tricoteuses with
knitting @-@ needles , take flight ; are met at the doors by a Gilt Youthhood
and &apos; mob of four thousand persons ; &apos; are hooted , flouted , hustled ;
fustigated , in a scandalous manner , cotillons retrousses ; -- and vanish in
mere hysterics . Sally out ye male Jacobins ! The male Jacobins sally out ;
but only to battle , disaster and confusion . So that armed Authority
has to intervene : and again on the morrow to intervene ; and suspend the
Jacobin Sessions forever and a day . ( Moniteur , Seances du 10 @-@ 12 Novembre
1794 : Deux Amis , xiii . 43 @-@ 49 . ) Gone are the Jacobins ; into invisibility ;
in a storm of laughter and howls . Their place is made a Normal School ,
the first of the kind seen ; it then vanishes into a &apos; Market of Thermidor
Ninth ; &apos; into a Market of Saint @-@ Honore , where is now peaceable chaffering
for poultry and greens . The solemn temples , the great globe itself ; the
baseless fabric ! Are not we such stuff , we and this world of ours , as
Dreams are made of ?

Maximum being abrogated , Trade was to take its own free course . Alas ,
Trade , shackled , topsyturvied in the way we saw , and now suddenly let
go again , can for the present take no course at all ; but only reel and
stagger . There is , so to speak , no Trade whatever for the time being .
Assignats , long sinking , emitted in such quantities , sink now with an
alacrity beyond parallel . &quot; Combien ? &quot; said one , to a Hackney @-@ coachman ,
&quot; What fare ? &quot; &quot; Six thousand livres , &quot; answered he : some three hundred
pounds sterling , in Paper @-@ money . ( Mercier , ii . 94 . &apos; 1st February , 1796 :
at the Bourse of Paris , the gold louis , &apos; of 20 francs in silver , &apos; costs
5,300 francs in assignats . &apos; Montgaillard , iv . 419 . ) Pressure of Maximum
withdrawn , the things it compressed likewise withdraw . &apos; Two ounces of
bread per day &apos; in the modicum allotted : wide @-@ waving , doleful are the
Bakers &apos; Queues ; Farmers &apos; houses are become pawnbrokers &apos; shops .

One can imagine , in these circumstances , with what humour Sansculottism
growled in its throat , &quot; La Cabarus ; &quot; beheld Ci @-@ devants return dancing ,
the Thermidor effulgence of recivilisation , and Balls in flesh @-@ coloured
drawers . Greek tunics and sandals ; hosts of Muscadins parading , with
their clubs loaded with lead ; -- and we here , cast out , abhorred , &apos; picking
offals from the street ; &apos; ( Fantin Desodoards , Histoire de la Revolution ,
vii. c . 4 . ) agitating in Baker &apos;s Queue for our two ounces of bread ! Will
the Jacobin lion , which they say is meeting secretly &apos; at the Acheveche ,
in bonnet rouge with loaded pistols , &apos; not awaken ? Seemingly not . Our
Collot , our Billaud , Barrere , Vadier , in these last days of March 1795,
are found worthy of Deportation , of Banishment beyond seas ; and shall ,
for the present , be trundled off to the Castle of Ham . The lion is
dead ; -- or writhing in death @-@ throes !

Behold , accordingly , on the day they call Twelfth of Germinal ( which
is also called First of April , not a lucky day ) , how lively are these
streets of Paris once more ! Floods of hungry women , of squalid hungry
men ; ejaculating : &quot; Bread , Bread and the Constitution of Ninety @-@ three ! &quot;
Paris has risen , once again , like the Ocean @-@ tide ; is flowing towards
the Tuileries , for Bread and a Constitution . Tuileries Sentries do their
best ; but it serves not : the Ocean @-@ tide sweeps them away ; inundates the
Convention Hall itself ; howling , &quot; Bread , and the Constitution ! &quot;

Unhappy Senators , unhappy People , there is yet , after all toils and
broils , no Bread , no Constitution . &quot; Du pain , pas tant de longs discours ,
Bread , not bursts of Parliamentary eloquence ! &quot; so wailed the Menads
of Maillard , five years ago and more ; so wail ye to this hour . The
Convention , with unalterable countenance , with what thought one knows
not , keeps its seat in this waste howling chaos ; rings its stormbell
from the Pavilion of Unity . Section Lepelletier , old Filles
Saint @-@ Thomas , who are of the money @-@ changing species ; these and Gilt
Youthhood fly to the rescue ; sweep chaos forth again , with levelled
bayonets . Paris is declared &apos; in a state of siege . &apos; Pichegru , Conqueror
of Holland , who happens to be here , is named Commandant , till the
disturbance end . He , in one day , so to speak , ends it . He accomplishes
the transfer of Billaud , Collot and Company ; dissipating all opposition
&apos;by two cannon @-@ shots , &apos; blank cannon @-@ shots , and the terror of his name ;
and thereupon announcing , with a Laconicism which should be imitated ,
&quot; Representatives , your decrees are executed , &quot; ( Moniteur , Seance du 13
Germinal ( 2d April ) 1795 . ) lays down his Commandantship .

This Revolt of Germinal , therefore , has passed , like a vain cry . The
Prisoners rest safe in Ham , waiting for ships ; some nine hundred &apos; chief
Terrorists of Paris &apos; are disarmed . Sansculottism , swept forth with
bayonets , has vanished , with its misery , to the bottom of Saint @-@ Antoine
and Saint @-@ Marceau . -- Time was when Usher Maillard with Menads could alter
the course of Legislation ; but that time is not . Legislation seems to
have got bayonets ; Section Lepelletier takes its firelock , not for us !
We retire to our dark dens ; our cry of hunger is called a Plot of Pitt ;
the Saloons glitter , the flesh @-@ coloured Drawers gyrate as before . It was
for &quot; The Cabarus &quot; then , and her Muscadins and Money @-@ changers , that
we fought ? It was for Balls in flesh @-@ coloured drawers that we took
Feudalism by the beard , and did , and dared , shedding our blood like
water ? Expressive Silence , muse thou their praise ! --



Chapter 3.7.V.

Lion sprawling its last .

Representative Carrier went to the Guillotine , in December last ;
protesting that he acted by orders . The Revolutionary Tribunal , after
all it has devoured , has now only , as Anarchic things do , to devour
itself . In the early days of May , men see a remarkable thing :
Fouquier @-@ Tinville pleading at the Bar once his own . He and his chief
Jurymen , Leroi August @-@ Tenth , Juryman Vilate , a Batch of Sixteen ;
pleading hard , protesting that they acted by orders : but pleading in
vain . Thus men break the axe with which they have done hateful things ;
the axe itself having grown hateful . For the rest , Fouquier died hard
enough : &quot; Where are thy Batches ? &quot; howled the People . -- &quot; Hungry canaille , &quot;
asked Fouquier , &quot; is thy Bread cheaper , wanting them ? &quot;

Remarkable Fouquier ; once but as other Attorneys and Law @-@ beagles , which
hunt ravenous on this Earth , a well @-@ known phasis of human nature ; and
now thou art and remainest the most remarkable Attorney that ever lived
and hunted in the Upper Air ! For , in this terrestrial Course of Time ,
there was to be an Avatar of Attorneyism ; the Heavens had said , Let
there be an Incarnation , not divine , of the venatory Attorney @-@ spirit
which keeps its eye on the bond only ; -- and lo , this was it ; and they
have attorneyed it in its turn . Vanish , then , thou rat @-@ eyed Incarnation
of Attorneyism ; who at bottom wert but as other Attorneys , and too
hungry Sons of Adam ! Juryman Vilate had striven hard for life , and
published , from his Prison , an ingenious Book , not unknown to us ; but it
would not stead : he also had to vanish ; and this his Book of the
Secret Causes of Thermidor , full of lies , with particles of truth in it
undiscoverable otherwise , is all that remains of him .

Revolutionary Tribunal has done ; but vengeance has not done .
Representative Lebon , after long struggling , is handed over to the
ordinary Law Courts , and by them guillotined . Nay , at Lyons and
elsewhere , resuscitated Moderatism , in its vengeance , will not wait
the slow process of Law ; but bursts into the Prisons , sets fire to the
prisons ; burns some three score imprisoned Jacobins to dire death ,
or chokes them &apos; with the smoke of straw . &apos; There go vengeful truculent
&apos;Companies of Jesus , &apos; &apos; Companies of the Sun ; &apos; slaying Jacobinism
wherever they meet with it ; flinging it into the Rhone @-@ stream ; which ,
once more , bears seaward a horrid cargo . ( Moniteur , du 27 Juin , du 31
Aout , 1795 ; Deux Amis , xiii . 121 @-@ 9 . ) Whereupon , at Toulon , Jacobinism
rises in revolt ; and is like to hang the National Representatives . -- With
such action and reaction , is not a poor National Convention hard
bested ? It is like the settlement of winds and waters , of seas long
tornado @-@ beaten ; and goes on with jumble and with jangle . Now flung
aloft , now sunk in trough of the sea , your Vessel of the Republic has
need of all pilotage and more .

What Parliament that ever sat under the Moon had such a series of
destinies , as this National Convention of France ? It came together to
make the Constitution ; and instead of that , it has had to make nothing
but destruction and confusion : to burn up Catholicisms , Aristocratisms ,
to worship Reason and dig Saltpetre , to fight Titanically with itself
and with the whole world . A Convention decimated by the Guillotine ;
above the tenth man has bowed his neck to the axe . Which has seen
Carmagnoles danced before it , and patriotic strophes sung amid
Church @-@ spoils ; the wounded of the Tenth of August defile in handbarrows ;
and , in the Pandemonial Midnight , Egalite &apos;s dames in tricolor drink
lemonade , and spectrum of Sieyes mount , saying , Death sans phrase . A
Convention which has effervesced , and which has congealed ; which has
been red with rage , and also pale with rage : sitting with pistols in its
pocket , drawing sword ( in a moment of effervescence ) : now storming to
the four winds , through a Danton @-@ voice , Awake , O France , and smite
the tyrants ; now frozen mute under its Robespierre , and answering his
dirge @-@ voice by a dubious gasp . Assassinated , decimated ; stabbed at , shot
at , in baths , on streets and staircases ; which has been the nucleus
of Chaos . Has it not heard the chimes at midnight ? It has deliberated ,
beset by a Hundred thousand armed men with artillery @-@ furnaces and
provision @-@ carts . It has been betocsined , bestormed ; over @-@ flooded by
black deluges of Sansculottism ; and has heard the shrill cry , Bread and
Soap . For , as we say , its the nucleus of Chaos ; it sat as the centre of
Sansculottism ; and had spread its pavilion on the waste Deep , where
is neither path nor landmark , neither bottom nor shore . In intrinsic
valour , ingenuity , fidelity , and general force and manhood , it has
perhaps not far surpassed the average of Parliaments : but in frankness
of purpose , in singularity of position , it seeks its fellow . One other
Sansculottic submersion , or at most two , and this wearied vessel of a
Convention reaches land .

Revolt of Germinal Twelfth ended as a vain cry ; moribund Sansculottism
was swept back into invisibility . There it has lain moaning , these six
weeks : moaning , and also scheming . Jacobins disarmed , flung forth from
their Tribune in mid air , must needs try to help themselves , in secret
conclave under ground . Lo , therefore , on the First day of the Month
Prairial , 20th of May 1795 , sound of the generale once more ; beating
sharp , ran @-@ tan , To arms , To arms !

Sansculottism has risen , yet again , from its death @-@ lair ; waste
wild @-@ flowing , as the unfruitful Sea . Saint @-@ Antoine is a @-@ foot : &quot; Bread and
the Constitution of Ninety @-@ three , &quot; so sounds it ; so stands it written
with chalk on the hats of men . They have their pikes , their firelocks ;
Paper of Grievances ; standards ; printed Proclamation , drawn up in quite
official manner , -- considering this , and also considering that , they , a
much @-@ enduring Sovereign People , are in Insurrection ; will have Bread and
the Constitution of Ninety @-@ three . And so the Barriers are seized ,
and the generale beats , and tocsins discourse discord . Black deluges
overflow the Tuileries ; spite of sentries , the Sanctuary itself is
invaded : enter , to our Order of the Day , a torrent of dishevelled women ,
wailing , &quot; Bread ! Bread ! &quot; President may well cover himself ; and have his
own tocsin rung in &apos; the Pavilion of Unity ; &apos; the ship of the State again
labours and leaks ; overwashed , near to swamping , with unfruitful brine .

What a day , once more ! Women are driven out : men storm irresistibly in ;
choke all corridors , thunder at all gates . Deputies , putting forth head ,
obtest , conjure ; Saint @-@ Antoine rages , &quot; Bread and Constitution . &quot; Report
has risen that the &apos; Convention is assassinating the women : &apos; crushing
and rushing , clangor and furor ! The oak doors have become as oak
tambourines , sounding under the axe of Saint @-@ Antoine ; plaster @-@ work
crackles , woodwork booms and jingles ; door starts up ; -- bursts @-@ in
Saint @-@ Antoine with frenzy and vociferation , Rag @-@ standards , printed
Proclamation , drum @-@ music : astonishment to eye and ear . Gendarmes , loyal
Sectioners charge through the other door ; they are recharged ; musketry
exploding : Saint @-@ Antoine cannot be expelled . Obtesting Deputies obtest
vainly ; Respect the President ; approach not the President ! Deputy
Feraud , stretching out his hands , baring his bosom scarred in the
Spanish wars , obtests vainly : threatens and resists vainly . Rebellious
Deputy of the Sovereign , if thou have fought , have not we too ? We have
no bread , no Constitution ! They wrench poor Feraud ; they tumble him ,
trample him , wrath waxing to see itself work : they drag him into the
corridor , dead or near it ; sever his head , and fix it on a pike . Ah ,
did an unexampled Convention want this variety of destiny too , then ?
Feraud &apos;s bloody head goes on a pike . Such a game has begun ; Paris and
the Earth may wait how it will end .

And so it billows free though all Corridors ; within , and without , far
as the eye reaches , nothing but Bedlam , and the great Deep broken loose !
President Boissy d &apos;Anglas sits like a rock : the rest of the Convention
is floated &apos; to the upper benches ; &apos; Sectioners and Gendarmes still
ranking there to form a kind of wall for them . And Insurrection rages ;
rolls its drums ; will read its Paper of Grievances , will have this
decreed , will have that . Covered sits President Boissy , unyielding ; like
a rock in the beating of seas . They menace him , level muskets at him , he
yields not ; they hold up Feraud &apos;s bloody head to him , with grave stern
air he bows to it , and yields not .

And the Paper of Grievances cannot get itself read for uproar ; and the
drums roll , and the throats bawl ; and Insurrection , like sphere @-@ music ,
is inaudible for very noise : Decree us this , Decree us that . One man we
discern bawling &apos; for the space of an hour at all intervals , &apos; &quot; Je
demande l &apos;arrestation des coquins et des laches . &quot; Really one of the
most comprehensive Petitions ever put up : which indeed , to this hour ,
includes all that you can reasonably ask Constitution of the Year One ,
Rotten @-@ Borough , Ballot @-@ Box , or other miraculous Political Ark of the
Covenant to do for you to the end of the world ! I also demand arrestment
of the Knaves and Dastards , and nothing more whatever . National
Representation , deluged with black Sansculottism glides out ; for help
elsewhere , for safety elsewhere : here is no help .

About four in the afternoon , there remain hardly more than some
Sixty Members : mere friends , or even secret @-@ leaders ; a remnant of the
Mountain @-@ crest , held in silence by Thermidorian thraldom . Now is the
time for them ; now or never let them descend , and speak ! They descend ,
these Sixty , invited by Sansculottism : Romme of the New Calendar , Ruhl
of the Sacred Phial , Goujon , Duquesnoy , Soubrany , and the rest . Glad
Sansculottism forms a ring for them ; Romme takes the President &apos;s chair ;
they begin resolving and decreeing . Fast enough now comes Decree after
Decree , in alternate brief strains , or strophe and antistrophe , -- what
will cheapen bread , what will awaken the dormant lion . And at every new
Decree , Sansculottism shouts , Decreed , Decreed ; and rolls its drums .

Fast enough ; the work of months in hours , -- when see , a Figure enters ,
whom in the lamp @-@ light we recognise to be Legendre ; and utters words :
fit to be hissed out ! And then see , Section Lepelletier or other
Muscadin Section enters , and Gilt Youth , with levelled bayonets ,
countenances screwed to the sticking @-@ place ! Tramp , tramp , with bayonets
gleaming in the lamp @-@ light : what can one do , worn down with long riot ,
grown heartless , dark , hungry , but roll back , but rush back , and escape
who can ? The very windows need to be thrown up , that Sansculottism may
escape fast enough . Money @-@ changer Sections and Gilt Youth sweep them
forth , with steel besom , far into the depths of Saint @-@ Antoine . Triumph
once more ! The Decrees of that Sixty are not so much as rescinded ;
they are declared null and non @-@ extant . Romme , Ruhl , Goujon and
the ringleaders , some thirteen in all , are decreed Accused .
Permanent @-@ session ends at three in the morning . ( Deux Amis , xiii .
129 @-@ 46 . ) Sansculottism , once more flung resupine , lies sprawling ;
sprawling its last .

Such was the First of Prairial , 20th May , 1795 . Second and Third of
Prairial , during which Sansculottism still sprawled , and unexpectedly
rang its tocsin , and assembled in arms , availed Sansculottism nothing .
What though with our Rommes and Ruhls , accused but not yet arrested , we
make a new &apos; True National Convention &apos; of our own , over in the East ; and
put the others Out of Law ? What though we rank in arms and march ? Armed
Force and Muscadin Sections , some thirty thousand men , environ that
old False Convention : we can but bully one another : bandying nicknames ,
&quot; Muscadins , &quot; against &quot; Blooddrinkers , Buveurs de Sang . &quot; Feraud &apos;s
Assassin , taken with the red hand , and sentenced , and now near to
Guillotine and Place de Greve , is retaken ; is carried back into
Saint @-@ Antoine : to no purpose . Convention Sectionaries and Gilt Youth
come , according to Decree , to seek him ; nay to disarm Saint @-@ Antoine !
And they do disarm it : by rolling of cannon , by springing upon enemy &apos;s
cannon ; by military audacity , and terror of the Law . Saint @-@ Antoine
surrenders its arms ; Santerre even advising it , anxious for life and
brewhouse . Feraud &apos;s Assassin flings himself from a high roof : and all is
lost . ( Toulongeon , v. 297 ; Moniteur , Nos. 244 , 5 , 6 . )

Discerning which things , old Ruhl shot a pistol through his old white
head ; dashed his life in pieces , as he had done the Sacred Phial
of Rheims . Romme , Goujon and the others stand ranked before a
swiftly @-@ appointed , swift Military Tribunal . Hearing the sentence , Goujon
drew a knife , struck it into his breast , passed it to his neighbour
Romme ; and fell dead . Romme did the like ; and another all but did it ;
Roman @-@ death rushing on there , as in electric @-@ chain , before your Bailiffs
could intervene ! The Guillotine had the rest .

They were the Ultimi Romanorum . Billaud , Collot and Company are now
ordered to be tried for life ; but are found to be already off , shipped
for Sinamarri , and the hot mud of Surinam . There let Billaud surround
himself with flocks of tame parrots ; Collot take the yellow fever , and
drinking a whole bottle of brandy , burn up his entrails . ( Dictionnaire
des Hommes Marquans , paras Billaud , Collot . ) Sansculottism spraws no
more . The dormant lion has become a dead one ; and now , as we see , any
hoof may smite him .



Chapter 3.7.VI.

Grilled Herrings .

So dies Sansculottism , the body of Sansculottism , or is changed . Its
ragged Pythian Carmagnole @-@ dance has transformed itself into a Pyrrhic ,
into a dance of Cabarus Balls . Sansculottism is dead ; extinguished
by new isms of that kind , which were its own natural progeny ; and is
buried , we may say , with such deafening jubilation and disharmony of
funeral @-@ knell on their part , that only after some half century or so
does one begin to learn clearly why it ever was alive .

And yet a meaning lay in it : Sansculottism verily was alive , a New @-@ Birth
of TIME ; nay it still lives , and is not dead , but changed . The soul of
it still lives ; still works far and wide , through one bodily shape
into another less amorphous , as is the way of cunning Time with his
New @-@ Births : -- till , in some perfected shape , it embrace the whole
circuit of the world ! For the wise man may now everywhere discern that
he must found on his manhood , not on the garnitures of his manhood .
He who , in these Epochs of our Europe , founds on garnitures , formulas ,
culottisms of what sort soever , is founding on old cloth and sheep @-@ skin ,
and cannot endure . But as for the body of Sansculottism , that is dead
and buried , -- and , one hopes , need not reappear , in primary amorphous
shape , for another thousand years !

It was the frightfullest thing ever borne of Time ? One of the
frightfullest . This Convention , now grown Anti @-@ Jacobin , did , with an eye
to justify and fortify itself , publish Lists of what the Reign of
Terror had perpetrated : Lists of Persons Guillotined . The Lists , cries
splenetic Abbe Montgaillard , were not complete . They contain the names
of , How many persons thinks the reader ? -- Two Thousand all but a few .
There were above Four Thousand , cries Montgaillard : so many were
guillotined , fusilladed , noyaded , done to dire death ; of whom Nine
Hundred were women . ( Montgaillard , iv . 241 . ) It is a horrible sum of
human lives , M. l &apos;Abbe : -- some ten times as many shot rightly on a field
of battle , and one might have had his Glorious @-@ Victory with Te @-@ Deum . It
is not far from the two @-@ hundredth part of what perished in the entire
Seven Years War . By which Seven Years War , did not the great Fritz
wrench Silesia from the great Theresa ; and a Pompadour , stung by
epigrams , satisfy herself that she could not be an Agnes Sorel ? The head
of man is a strange vacant sounding @-@ shell , M. l &apos;Abbe ; and studies Cocker
to small purpose .

But what if History , somewhere on this Planet , were to hear of a Nation ,
the third soul of whom had not for thirty weeks each year as many
third @-@ rate potatoes as would sustain him ? ( Report of the Irish Poor @-@ Law
Commission , 1836 . ) History , in that case , feels bound to consider that
starvation is starvation ; that starvation from age to age presupposes
much : History ventures to assert that the French Sansculotte of
Ninety @-@ three , who , roused from long death @-@ sleep , could rush at once
to the frontiers , and die fighting for an immortal Hope and Faith of
Deliverance for him and his , was but the second @-@ miserablest of men ! The
Irish Sans @-@ potato , had he not senses then , nay a soul ? In his frozen
darkness , it was bitter for him to die famishing ; bitter to see his
children famish . It was bitter for him to be a beggar , a liar and a
knave . Nay , if that dreary Greenland @-@ wind of benighted Want , perennial
from sire to son , had frozen him into a kind of torpor and numb
callosity , so that he saw not , felt not , was this , for a creature with a
soul in it , some assuagement ; or the cruellest wretchedness of all ?

Such things were , such things are ; and they go on in silence peaceably :
and Sansculottisms follow them . History , looking back over this France
through long times , back to Turgot &apos;s time for instance , when dumb
Drudgery staggered up to its King &apos;s Palace , and in wide expanse of
sallow faces , squalor and winged raggedness , presented hieroglyphically
its Petition of Grievances ; and for answer got hanged on a &apos; new gallows
forty feet high , &apos; -- confesses mournfully that there is no period to be
met with , in which the general Twenty @-@ five Millions of France suffered
less than in this period which they name Reign of Terror ! But it was not
the Dumb Millions that suffered here ; it was the Speaking Thousands , and
Hundreds , and Units ; who shrieked and published , and made the world
ring with their wail , as they could and should : that is the
grand peculiarity . The frightfullest Births of Time are never the
loud @-@ speaking ones , for these soon die ; they are the silent ones ,
which can live from century to century ! Anarchy , hateful as Death , is
abhorrent to the whole nature of man ; and must itself soon die .

Wherefore let all men know what of depth and of height is still
revealed in man ; and , with fear and wonder , with just sympathy and just
antipathy , with clear eye and open heart , contemplate it and appropriate
it ; and draw innumerable inferences from it . This inference , for
example , among the first : &apos; That if the gods of this lower world will sit
on their glittering thrones , indolent as Epicurus &apos; gods , with the living
Chaos of Ignorance and Hunger weltering uncared for at their feet , and
smooth Parasites preaching , Peace , peace , when there is no peace , &apos; then
the dark Chaos , it would seem , will rise ; has risen , and O Heavens ! has
it not tanned their skins into breeches for itself ? That there be
no second Sansculottism in our Earth for a thousand years , let us
understand well what the first was ; and let Rich and Poor of us go and
do otherwise . -- But to our tale .

The Muscadin Sections greatly rejoice ; Cabarus Balls gyrate : the
well @-@ nigh insoluble problem Republic without Anarchy , have we not solved
it ? -- Law of Fraternity or Death is gone : chimerical Obtain @-@ who @-@ need has
become practical Hold @-@ who @-@ have . To anarchic Republic of the Poverties
there has succeeded orderly Republic of the Luxuries ; which will
continue as long as it can .

On the Pont au Change , on the Place de Greve , in long sheds , Mercier , in
these summer evenings , saw working men at their repast . One &apos;s allotment
of daily bread has sunk to an ounce and a half . &apos; Plates containing
each three grilled herrings , sprinkled with shorn onions , wetted with
a little vinegar ; to this add some morsel of boiled prunes , and lentils
swimming in a clear sauce : at these frugal tables , the cook &apos;s gridiron
hissing near by , and the pot simmering on a fire between two stones , I
have seen them ranged by the hundred ; consuming , without bread , their
scant messes , far too moderate for the keenness of their appetite , and
the extent of their stomach . &apos; ( Nouveau Paris , iv . 118 . ) Seine water ,
rushing plenteous by , will supply the deficiency .

O man of Toil , thy struggling and thy daring , these six long years of
insurrection and tribulation , thou hast profited nothing by it , then ?
Thou consumest thy herring and water , in the blessed gold @-@ red evening .
O why was the Earth so beautiful , becrimsoned with dawn and twilight ,
if man &apos;s dealings with man were to make it a vale of scarcity , of
tears , not even soft tears ? Destroying of Bastilles , discomfiting of
Brunswicks , fronting of Principalities and Powers , of Earth and Tophet ,
all that thou hast dared and endured , -- it was for a Republic of the
Cabarus Saloons ? Patience ; thou must have patience : the end is not yet .



Chapter 3.7.VII.

The Whiff of Grapeshot .

In fact , what can be more natural , one may say inevitable , as a
Post @-@ Sansculottic transitionary state , than even this ? Confused wreck
of a Republic of the Poverties , which ended in Reign of Terror , is
arranging itself into such composure as it can . Evangel of Jean @-@ Jacques ,
and most other Evangels , becoming incredible , what is there for it but
return to the old Evangel of Mammon ? Contrat @-@ Social is true or untrue ,
Brotherhood is Brotherhood or Death ; but money always will buy money &apos;s
worth : in the wreck of human dubitations , this remains indubitable , that
Pleasure is pleasant . Aristocracy of Feudal Parchment has passed away
with a mighty rushing ; and now , by a natural course , we arrive at
Aristocracy of the Moneybag . It is the course through which all European
Societies are at this hour travelling . Apparently a still baser sort of
Aristocracy ? An infinitely baser ; the basest yet known !

In which however there is this advantage , that , like Anarchy itself ,
it cannot continue . Hast thou considered how Thought is stronger than
Artillery @-@ parks , and ( were it fifty years after death and martyrdom ,
or were it two thousand years ) writes and unwrites Acts of Parliament ,
removes mountains ; models the World like soft clay ? Also how the
beginning of all Thought , worth the name , is Love ; and the wise head
never yet was , without first the generous heart ? The Heavens cease not
their bounty : they send us generous hearts into every generation . And
now what generous heart can pretend to itself , or be hoodwinked into
believing , that Loyalty to the Moneybag is a noble Loyalty ? Mammon ,
cries the generous heart out of all ages and countries , is the basest
of known Gods , even of known Devils . In him what glory is there , that
ye should worship him ? No glory discernable ; not even terror : at
best , detestability , ill @-@ matched with despicability ! -- Generous hearts ,
discerning , on this hand , widespread Wretchedness , dark without and
within , moistening its ounce @-@ and @-@ half of bread with tears ; and on that
hand , mere Balls in fleshcoloured drawers , and inane or foul glitter
of such sort , -- cannot but ejaculate , cannot but announce : Too much , O
divine Mammon ; somewhat too much ! -- The voice of these , once announcing
itself , carries fiat and pereat in it , for all things here below .

Meanwhile , we will hate Anarchy as Death , which it is ; and the things
worse than Anarchy shall be hated more ! Surely Peace alone is
fruitful . Anarchy is destruction : a burning up , say , of Shams and
Insupportabilities ; but which leaves Vacancy behind . Know this also ,
that out of a world of Unwise nothing but an Unwisdom can be made .
Arrange it , Constitution @-@ build it , sift it through Ballot @-@ Boxes as thou
wilt , it is and remains an Unwisdom , -- the new prey of new quacks and
unclean things , the latter end of it slightly better than the beginning .
Who can bring a wise thing out of men unwise ? Not one . And so Vacancy
and general Abolition having come for this France , what can Anarchy do
more ? Let there be Order , were it under the Soldier &apos;s Sword ; let there
be Peace , that the bounty of the Heavens be not spilt ; that what of
Wisdom they do send us bring fruit in its season ! -- It remains to be seen
how the quellers of Sansculottism were themselves quelled , and sacred
right of Insurrection was blown away by gunpowder : wherewith this
singular eventful History called French Revolution ends .

The Convention , driven such a course by wild wind , wild tide , and
steerage and non @-@ steerage , these three years , has become weary of its
own existence , sees all men weary of it ; and wishes heartily to finish .
To the last , it has to strive with contradictions : it is now getting
fast ready with a Constitution , yet knows no peace . Sieyes , we say , is
making the Constitution once more ; has as good as made it . Warned by
experience , the great Architect alters much , admits much . Distinction of
Active and Passive Citizen , that is , Money @-@ qualification for Electors :
nay Two Chambers , &apos; Council of Ancients , &apos; as well as &apos; Council of Five
Hundred ; &apos; to that conclusion have we come ! In a like spirit , eschewing
that fatal self @-@ denying ordinance of your Old Constituents , we enact not
only that actual Convention Members are re @-@ eligible , but that Two @-@ thirds
of them must be re @-@ elected . The Active Citizen Electors shall for this
time have free choice of only One @-@ third of their National Assembly .
Such enactment , of Two @-@ thirds to be re @-@ elected , we append to our
Constitution ; we submit our Constitution to the Townships of France , and
say , Accept both , or reject both . Unsavoury as this appendix may be , the
Townships , by overwhelming majority , accept and ratify . With Directory
of Five ; with Two good Chambers , double @-@ majority of them nominated by
ourselves , one hopes this Constitution may prove final . March it will ;
for the legs of it , the re @-@ elected Two @-@ thirds , are already there , able
to march . Sieyes looks at his Paper Fabric with just pride .

But now see how the contumacious Sections , Lepelletier foremost , kick
against the pricks ! Is it not manifest infraction of one &apos;s Elective
Franchise , Rights of Man , and Sovereignty of the People , this appendix
of re @-@ electing your Two @-@ thirds ? Greedy tyrants who would perpetuate
yourselves ! -- For the truth is , victory over Saint @-@ Antoine , and long
right of Insurrection , has spoiled these men . Nay spoiled all men .
Consider too how each man was free to hope what he liked ; and now there
is to be no hope , there is to be fruition , fruition of this .

In men spoiled by long right of Insurrection , what confused ferments
will rise , tongues once begun wagging ! Journalists declaim , your
Lacretelles , Laharpes ; Orators spout . There is Royalism traceable in it ,
and Jacobinism . On the West Frontier , in deep secrecy , Pichegru , durst
he trust his Army , is treating with Conde : in these Sections , there
spout wolves in sheep &apos;s clothing , masked Emigrants and Royalists !
( Napoleon , Las Cases , Choix des Rapports , xvii . 398 @-@ 411 . ) All men , as
we say , had hoped , each that the Election would do something for his own
side : and now there is no Election , or only the third of one . Black is
united with white against this clause of the Two @-@ thirds ; all the Unruly
of France , who see their trade thereby near ending .

Section Lepelletier , after Addresses enough , finds that such clause is
a manifest infraction ; that it , Lepelletier , for one , will simply not
conform thereto ; and invites all other free Sections to join it , &apos; in
central Committee , &apos; in resistance to oppression . ( Deux Amis , xiii .
375 @-@ 406 . ) The Sections join it , nearly all ; strong with their Forty
Thousand fighting men . The Convention therefore may look to itself !
Lepelletier , on this 12th day of Vendemiaire , 4th of October 1795 , is
sitting in open contravention , in its Convent of Filles Saint @-@ Thomas ,
Rue Vivienne , with guns primed . The Convention has some Five Thousand
regular troops at hand ; Generals in abundance ; and a Fifteen Hundred
of miscellaneous persecuted Ultra @-@ Jacobins , whom in this crisis it has
hastily got together and armed , under the title Patriots of Eighty @-@ nine .
Strong in Law , it sends its General Menou to disarm Lepelletier .

General Menou marches accordingly , with due summons and demonstration ;
with no result . General Menou , about eight in the evening , finds that
he is standing ranked in the Rue Vivienne , emitting vain summonses ;
with primed guns pointed out of every window at him ; and that he cannot
disarm Lepelletier . He has to return , with whole skin , but without
success ; and be thrown into arrest as &apos; a traitor . &apos; Whereupon the whole
Forty Thousand join this Lepelletier which cannot be vanquished : to what
hand shall a quaking Convention now turn ? Our poor Convention , after
such voyaging , just entering harbour , so to speak , has struck on the
bar ; -- and labours there frightfully , with breakers roaring round it ,
Forty thousand of them , like to wash it , and its Sieyes Cargo and the
whole future of France , into the deep ! Yet one last time , it struggles ,
ready to perish .

Some call for Barras to be made Commandant ; he conquered in Thermidor .
Some , what is more to the purpose , bethink them of the Citizen
Buonaparte , unemployed Artillery Officer , who took Toulon . A man of
head , a man of action : Barras is named Commandant &apos;s @-@ Cloak ; this young
Artillery Officer is named Commandant . He was in the Gallery at the
moment , and heard it ; he withdrew , some half hour , to consider with
himself : after a half hour of grim compressed considering , to be or not
to be , he answers Yea .

And now , a man of head being at the centre of it , the whole matter gets
vital . Swift , to Camp of Sablons ; to secure the Artillery , there are
not twenty men guarding it ! A swift Adjutant , Murat is the name of him ,
gallops ; gets thither some minutes within time , for Lepelletier was also
on march that way : the Cannon are ours . And now beset this post , and
beset that ; rapid and firm : at Wicket of the Louvre , in Cul de Sac
Dauphin , in Rue Saint @-@ Honore , from Pont Neuf all along the north Quays ,
southward to Pont ci @-@ devant Royal , -- rank round the Sanctuary of the
Tuileries , a ring of steel discipline ; let every gunner have his match
burning , and all men stand to their arms !

Thus there is Permanent @-@ session through night ; and thus at sunrise of
the morrow , there is seen sacred Insurrection once again : vessel of
State labouring on the bar ; and tumultuous sea all round her , beating
generale , arming and sounding , -- not ringing tocsin , for we have left
no tocsin but our own in the Pavilion of Unity . It is an imminence of
shipwreck , for the whole world to gaze at . Frightfully she labours , that
poor ship , within cable @-@ length of port ; huge peril for her . However , she
has a man at the helm . Insurgent messages , received , and not received ;
messenger admitted blindfolded ; counsel and counter @-@ counsel : the poor
ship labours ! -- Vendemiaire 13th , year 4 : curious enough , of all days , it
is the Fifth day of October , anniversary of that Menad @-@ march , six years
ago ; by sacred right of Insurrection we are got thus far .

Lepelletier has seized the Church of Saint @-@ Roch ; has seized the Pont
Neuf , our piquet there retreating without fire . Stray shots fall from
Lepelletier ; rattle down on the very Tuileries staircase . On the other
hand , women advance dishevelled , shrieking , Peace ; Lepelletier behind
them waving its hat in sign that we shall fraternise . Steady ! The
Artillery Officer is steady as bronze ; can be quick as lightning . He
sends eight hundred muskets with ball @-@ cartridges to the Convention
itself ; honourable Members shall act with these in case of extremity :
whereat they look grave enough . Four of the afternoon is struck .
( Moniteur , Seance du 5 Octobre 1795 . ) Lepelletier , making nothing by
messengers , by fraternity or hat @-@ waving , bursts out , along the Southern
Quai Voltaire , along streets , and passages , treble @-@ quick , in huge
veritable onslaught ! Whereupon , thou bronze Artillery Officer -- ? &quot; Fire ! &quot;
say the bronze lips . Roar and again roar , continual , volcano @-@ like ,
goes his great gun , in the Cul de Sac Dauphin against the Church of
Saint @-@ Roch ; go his great guns on the Pont Royal ; go all his great
guns ; -- blow to air some two hundred men , mainly about the Church of
Saint @-@ Roch ! Lepelletier cannot stand such horse @-@ play ; no Sectioner can
stand it ; the Forty @-@ thousand yield on all sides , scour towards covert .
&apos;Some hundred or so of them gathered both Theatre de la Republique ;
but , &apos; says he , &apos; a few shells dislodged them . It was all finished at
six . &apos; 

The Ship is over the bar , then ; free she bounds shoreward , -- amid
shouting and vivats ! Citoyen Buonaparte is &apos; named General of the
Interior , by acclamation ; &apos; quelled Sections have to disarm in such
humour as they may ; sacred right of Insurrection is gone for ever !
The Sieyes Constitution can disembark itself , and begin marching . The
miraculous Convention Ship has got to land ; -- and is there , shall we
figuratively say , changed , as Epic Ships are wont , into a kind of
Sea Nymph , never to sail more ; to roam the waste Azure , a Miracle in
History !

&apos;It is false , &apos; says Napoleon , &apos; that we fired first with blank charge ;
it had been a waste of life to do that . &apos; Most false : the firing was with
sharp and sharpest shot : to all men it was plain that here was no sport ;
the rabbets and plinths of Saint @-@ Roch Church show splintered by it , to
this hour . -- Singular : in old Broglie &apos;s time , six years ago , this Whiff
of Grapeshot was promised ; but it could not be given then , could not
have profited then . Now , however , the time is come for it , and the
man ; and behold , you have it ; and the thing we specifically call French
Revolution is blown into space by it , and become a thing that was ! --

Homer &apos;s Epos , it is remarked , is like a Bas @-@ relief sculpture : it does
not conclude , but merely ceases . Such , indeed , is the Epos of Universal
History itself . Directorates , Consulates , Emperorships , Restorations ,
Citizen @-@ Kingships succeed this Business in due series , in due genesis
one out of the other . Nevertheless the First @-@ parent of all these may be
said to have gone to air in the way we see . A Baboeuf Insurrection ,
next year , will die in the birth ; stifled by the Soldiery . A Senate , if
tinged with Royalism , can be purged by the Soldiery ; and an Eighteenth
of Fructidor transacted by the mere shew of bayonets . ( Moniteur , du 5
Septembre 1797 . ) Nay Soldiers &apos; bayonets can be used a posteriori on a
Senate , and make it leap out of window , -- still bloodless ; and produce
an Eighteenth of Brumaire . ( 9th November 1799 , Choix des Rapports , xvii .
1 @-@ 96 . ) Such changes must happen : but they are managed by intriguings ,
caballings , and then by orderly word of command ; almost like mere
changes of Ministry . Not in general by sacred right of Insurrection ,
but by milder methods growing ever milder , shall the Events of French
history be henceforth brought to pass .

It is admitted that this Directorate , which owned , at its starting ,
these three things , an &apos; old table , a sheet of paper , and an ink @-@ bottle , &apos;
and no visible money or arrangement whatever , ( Bailleul , Examen critique
des Considerations de Madame de Stael , ii . 275 . ) did wonders : that
France , since the Reign of Terror hushed itself , has been a new France ,
awakened like a giant out of torpor ; and has gone on , in the Internal
Life of it , with continual progress . As for the External form and forms
of Life , -- what can we say except that out of the Eater there comes
Strength ; out of the Unwise there comes not Wisdom ! Shams are burnt up ;
nay , what as yet is the peculiarity of France , the very Cant of them
is burnt up . The new Realities are not yet come : ah no , only Phantasms ,
Paper models , tentative Prefigurements of such ! In France there are now
Four Million Landed Properties ; that black portent of an Agrarian Law is
as it were realised ! What is still stranger , we understand all Frenchmen
have &apos; the right of duel ; &apos; the Hackney @-@ coachman with the Peer , if insult
be given : such is the law of Public Opinion . Equality at least in death !
The Form of Government is by Citizen King , frequently shot at , not yet
shot .

On the whole , therefore , has it not been fulfilled what was prophesied ,
ex @-@ postfacto indeed , by the Archquack Cagliostro , or another ? He , as
he looked in rapt vision and amazement into these things , thus spake :
( Diamond Necklace , p . 35 . ) &apos; Ha ! What is this ? Angels , Uriel , Anachiel ,
and the other Five ; Pentagon of Rejuvenescence ; Power that destroyed
Original Sin ; Earth , Heaven , and thou Outer Limbo , which men name
Hell ! Does the EMPIRE Of IMPOSTURE waver ? Burst there , in starry sheen
updarting , Light @-@ rays from out its dark foundations ; as it rocks and
heaves , not in travail @-@ throes , but in death @-@ throes ? Yea , Light @-@ rays ,
piercing , clear , that salute the Heavens , -- lo , they kindle it ; their
starry clearness becomes as red Hellfire !

&apos;IMPOSTURE is burnt up : one Red @-@ sea of Fire , wild @-@ billowing enwraps the
World ; with its fire @-@ tongue , licks at the very Stars . Thrones are hurled
into it , and Dubois mitres , and Prebendal Stalls that drop fatness ,
and -- ha ! what see I ? -- all the Gigs of Creation ; all , all ! Wo is me !
Never since Pharaoh &apos;s Chariots , in the Red @-@ sea of water , was there wreck
of Wheel @-@ vehicles like this in the Sea of Fire . Desolate , as ashes ,
as gases , shall they wander in the wind . Higher , higher yet flames the
Fire @-@ Sea ; crackling with new dislocated timber ; hissing with leather
and prunella . The metal Images are molten ; the marble Images become
mortar @-@ lime ; the stone Mountains sulkily explode . RESPECTABILITY , with
all her collected Gigs inflamed for funeral pyre , wailing , leaves the
earth : not to return save under new Avatar . Imposture , how it burns ,
through generations : how it is burnt up ; for a time . The World is black
ashes ; which , ah , when will they grow green ? The Images all run into
amorphous Corinthian brass ; all Dwellings of men destroyed ; the very
mountains peeled and riven , the valleys black and dead : it is an empty
World ! Wo to them that shall be born then ! -- A King , a Queen ( ah
me ! ) were hurled in ; did rustle once ; flew aloft , crackling , like
paper @-@ scroll . Iscariot Egalite was hurled in ; thou grim De Launay , with
thy grim Bastille ; whole kindreds and peoples ; five millions of mutually
destroying Men . For it is the End of the Dominion of IMPOSTURE ( which
is Darkness and opaque Firedamp ) ; and the burning up , with unquenchable
fire , of all the Gigs that are in the Earth . &apos; This Prophecy , we say , has
it not been fulfilled , is it not fulfilling ?

And so here , O Reader , has the time come for us two to part . Toilsome
was our journeying together ; not without offence ; but it is done . To me
thou wert as a beloved shade , the disembodied or not yet embodied spirit
of a Brother . To thee I was but as a Voice . Yet was our relation a kind
of sacred one ; doubt not that ! Whatsoever once sacred things become
hollow jargons , yet while the Voice of Man speaks with Man , hast thou
not there the living fountain out of which all sacrednesses sprang ,
and will yet spring ? Man , by the nature of him , is definable as &apos; an
incarnated Word . &apos; Ill stands it with me if I have spoken falsely : thine
also it was to hear truly . Farewell .
